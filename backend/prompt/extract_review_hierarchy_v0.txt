Extract comprehensive customer insights from reviews about {{PRODUCT}}.
The output format is JSON in English:
{
"phy": {
"<PHYSICAL>": {
"<PID>@<DETAIL>": {
"<SENT>": [ID, …]
}
}
},
"perf": {
"<PERF>": {
"<perf_id>@<DETAIL>": {
"<SENT>": {<PERF_REASON>: [ID, …]}
}
}
},
"use": {
"<USE>": {
"<SENT>": {<USE_REASON>: [ID, …]}
}
}
}

Definitions:
- <PID>: Unique ID for physical aspect ("phy"), starting from A. After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.
- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the {{PRODUCT}} without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)
- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.
- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).
- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>
- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions ("perf"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.
- <PERF>: The {{PRODUCT}}' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case
- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use "?". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)
- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.
- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment. Include all mentioned reasons, or "?" if none can be inferred. <USE_REASON> and <USE> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- <PHYSICAL>/<PERF> and <DETAIL> MUST NOT include:
  * Generic statements without details (e.g., "good", "bad quality")
  * Issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., "fast shipping", "delivery time")
- If a review mentions any physical aspect, related performance, or use together, extract them as separate entries under "phy," "perf," and "use," with no overlap.
- Make sure each <DETAIL> is under the most relevant <PHYSICAL> or <PERF> in the context of {{PRODUCT}}
- Preserve negations

Key Instructions:
- Break down reviews with multiple aspects, performances, or uses into individual entries.
- Escape special characters with backslash that could cause JSON syntax errors.
- Include only explicitly mentioned reasons, and use "?" where no reason is mentioned.

Final Checklist:
- Go through all reviews and ensure that no aspect, performance, use, or reason is omitted, even if only mentioned once.
- Review all entries to ensure proper separation between aspects, performances, and uses.
