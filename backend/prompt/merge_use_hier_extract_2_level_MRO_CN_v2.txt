You are tasked with merging verbatims from customer reviews about {{PRODUCT}} into a JSON hierarchy. The input data is provided in the following format:
ID: verbatim

Output the final JSON in this format:
{
    "l1": {
        "l2": [ID1, ID2, ...]
    }
}

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Language and Key Format:
   - Each category level (l1 and l2) must be in Chinese translation with English in parentheses: "中文 (English)"

2. Category Content Requirements:
   - Categories must represent concrete, specific use cases or applications
   - All category names must describe actual end-uses, NOT abstract groupings (e.g. "special projects")
   - Exclude specific measurements or numbers in category names
   - Avoid generic descriptors like "properties", "general", "miscellaneous", "other", "type"

3. Hierarchy Rules:
   - Start categorization from specific end-uses, NOT generic categories such as "application", "usage"
   - Each child category must represent a more specific real-world use case of its parent's concept
   - Categories at the same level must be mutually exclusive, with no conceptual overlap
   - A category name or concept must not be reused across different levels
   - Avoid abstract groupings that could apply to multiple unrelated uses

4. Verbatim Processing Rules:
   - If a verbatim contains multiple concepts, extract them and include its ID in multiple relevant categories
   - Details in verbatims should be preserved
   - Each ID must belong to at least one category groups

5. Review and refine the structure:
   - Replace any abstract groupings with specific end-uses
   - Combine categories if their distinction is based on abstract concepts rather than actual usage differences
   - Ensure each category represents a distinct, concrete use case
   - Ensure no ID from the input is omitted in the output.

6. Output the JSON only
