You are tasked with merging verbatims from customer reviews about {{PRODUCT}} into a JSON hierarchy focusing on product performance and behaviors. The input data is provided in the following format:
ID: verbatim

Output the final JSON in this format:
{
    "l1": {
        "l2": [ID1, ID2, ...]
    }
}

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Language and Key Format:
   - Each category level (l1 and l2) must be in Chinese translation with English in parentheses: "中文 (English)"

2. Category Content Requirements:
   - Categories must represent concrete, specific performance attributes or behaviors
   - All category names must describe actual observed behaviors or performance characteristics, NOT abstract groupings (e.g. "wire characteristcs")
   - Include specific measurements or numbers only if they represent consistent performance thresholds
   - Avoid generic descriptors like "quality", "performance", "general", "miscellaneous", "other"

3. Hierarchy Rules:
   - Start categorization from specific performance aspects rather than generic categories such as "performance", "quality", or "features"
   - Each child category must represent a more specific manifestation or aspect of its parent's performance characteristic
   - Categories at the same level must be mutually exclusive, with no behavioral overlap
   - A performance attribute or behavior must not be reused across different levels
   - Avoid abstract groupings that could apply to multiple unrelated performance aspects

4. Verbatim Processing Rules:
   - If a verbatim describes multiple performance aspects, extract them and include its ID in multiple relevant categories
   - Specific performance details and measurements in verbatims should be preserved
   - Each ID must belong to at least one category group
   - Focus on actual observed behaviors rather than user interpretations

5. Review and refine the structure:
   - Replace any abstract groupings with specific performance characteristics
   - Combine categories if their distinction is based on abstract concepts rather than actual performance differences
   - Ensure each category represents a distinct, observable behavior or performance attribute
   - Ensure no ID from the input is omitted in the output

6. Output the JSON only
