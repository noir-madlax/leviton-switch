      "review_snippet": "This thing is sweet!  I have it connected to patio lighting.  The 30-second fade feature is a bit funky (slow fade to about 50% power then a sudden shut-off), but it is still very cool.  While the first post-install setup felt like too many steps, those steps are fairly intuitive.  Once set up, operation is very simple.  Now I have bright light when I need it and mood lighting when I want it.  Sweet."
