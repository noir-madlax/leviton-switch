  "customers_say": "Customers find the Clapper easy to use and install, with clear directions, and appreciate that it makes turning lights on and off fun. However, the device's functionality and reliability receive mixed feedback - while some say it works well, others report it doesn't always respond, and while some find it reliable, others mention it breaks with minimal use. Moreover, the noise level and clap volume receive mixed reviews, with customers noting it reacts to strange noises and requires loud, careful clapping. Additionally, the value for money receives negative feedback, with customers saying it's not worth the cost.AI Generated from the text of customer reviews",

Unfortunately, it does register perfectly timed coughs and will turn on/off unexpectedly. It doesn't work for items that have to be turned on/off with buttons like an oscillating fan."

Clap on, clap off, the Clapper!\" My specific memory is the last few seconds, with an \"old\" (to me) lady with white curly hair clapping her hands twice in a very succinct fashion and she rolls over in bed as her light shuts off.That's me now. I should have done it before the hip operation but so it goes. I have the original house automation appliance and can shut my nightstand light without having to reeeeeach over there (it's  not close, the way things are set up). I can nestle into bed with River beside me, snuggle up to my pregnancy pillow on the other side (it's great for my bad back, hip, knees, etc. I highly recommend it and will link it in the comments) and clap my hands to shut the light.Of course, it also turns the light on and off when I'm clapping my hands at the dogs because they're being buttheads and I need extra emphasis on what I'm saying to them. Or when I close the nightstand drawer a little too hard. Or the bed shifts against the wall. Or I drop something on the hardwood floor, which is happening way more often than is necessary.If I applaud something, my bedroom becomes a disco.But I don't have to contort myself and hurt my new hip to shut my light anymore. Who needs fancy AI-enabled house automation when you can just clap your hands? Alexa, Google, etc. can buzz off. Or, clap off if you like.5 claps for the Clapper. 👏👏👏👏👏"

It seems to wait to turn on until you get to the point of frustration."
