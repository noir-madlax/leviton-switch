I haven't purchased many of this style of paddle switch, so not sure how the build quality matches up with other options out there. The plastic feels good, though a little lighter plastic on the paddles than I would have expected -- and the click sound when switching is a bit sharper (hollow sounding?) than I would prefer (though it makes a very secure click) -- Overall, the switches look and work great -- and seem to have good quality switching mechanisms."
