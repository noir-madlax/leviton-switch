      "review_snippet": "I was very impressed with all the features packed into these switches. Weather, clock, multiple choices for display (analogue or digital clock, on-screen display of light on/off status, etc), Matter or WiFi communications, dimming or non-dimming, intercom to one switch or voice broadcast to all, default “on” levels (75% brightness for example), microphone on/off, vacation mode, scenes… impressive and very high tech looking.  I don’t have 2 in the same house so I haven’t tested voice quality of the intercom features.I put one in a home I’m selling so it would turn the porch lights on at night & off at sunrise. I went to the house this weekend and it was locked up, displaying “HomeAI” and nothing else. I couldn’t turn on the light locally by the push button and the touch screen was frozen, but it still worked via the app. I tripped the breaker for a minute and it revived again.  I hope it continues working!The one thing I wish you could do (and could be done with a firmware upgrade) is have the switch stay on whatever screen you wanted it left on. One switch could be an intercom, one could have the digital slider for dimming, one could display weather, one switch could always display the “Scenes” buttons to control groups of lights, etc… but currently they all default back to the same screen after 15 seconds or so and you have to scroll to your preferred screen. Price is very reasonable for what you get.One “gotcha” to be aware of. Although it supports the universal Matter protocol, it cannot control any other Matter switches except the ORVIBO ones."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2024",
      "review_snippet": "This is probably the most technically advanced switch I've found. I used it to replace some older technology Insteon switches. This was much better. The things I loved are.1. That the switch displays device names that make sense and you can easily change it. With the older tech I was using, you had to buy custom engraved keys or use clear keycaps with a label under it.2. I like that it has a button on the bottom  that can be used to turn the main light on or off.3. You can add control of any other Orvibo switch or Orvibo app scene to the switch.4. On the main page (screen), you can personalize the page to display several different options that include combinations of the weather, date, time, and main switch button.5. It supports Matter, but not until it does a firmware update on those I received.What are the main things I didn't like?1. For installations where you have in a multi-gang box with multi-gang switch plate, the Decora cutout required needs to be larger for this. If there is a brand that fits properly, I'd sure like to know what it is. What this means is you have to file the openings of the plate to properly fit the switch. This can take quite a bit of time to do it properly. For single gang, the switch comes with it's own screwless plate.2. Response can be a little slow ... noticeably. I have a mix of Matter over WiFi and Matter over Thread switches and I do not have this issue with Matter over Thread ... so perhaps they need to consider moving to that.3. I've had an issue where some of the switch loose their WiFi connection ... like right now out of 10 switches, two are showing \"No Response\" in the HomeKit app. My router supports a separate IOT network and all of my smart devices are connected to it. So far, the only way to get these switches to reconnect is to either reboot the router or go to the WiFi setup on the switch and turn the WiFi off and then back on. Whenever I have the \"No Response\" error showing in HomeKit, the switch will not respond to Siri commands or via HomeKit on an iPhone. In my experience, Thread just seems more reliable ... so again a Thread version would be great.4. Lastly, they talk about how to wire the switch for 3-way and basically one switch operates as a 1 way switch connected to the load and the other is simply a remote connected to a hot wire and white wire with the load wire capped off. The issue is there is no way of programming or linking the two switches so the the switch on the bottom of the remote will toggle the main light on/off. In addition, there is a button that appears on the screens that controls power to the load that is not connected to anything. Technical support responded ... and I get there is was a way of hiding that button prior to the Matter firmware upgrade, but it seems no matter what I tried I could not hide it with the Matter firmware. The idea of showing a button on the screen that has no purpose makes this switch unusable as a 3-way in my mind. My old home automation did the same thing, but you could pair the remote switch to give the same appearance as a 3-way.But overall, I really love how this switch looks and the design. I really am not interested in intercom or broadcast modes to didn't test those."

      "review_snippet": "This switch (mixpad d1) with the iPhone app isn’t ready for any use other than a switch. It’s matter capable but can ONLY control its own ORVIBO devices. It cannot handle anything setup in your matter system. It cannot make a scene with your other matter devices. Worst is in the display options on the switch - you can turn on a single button at the bottom of the display - but it can’t be customized or changed to something else (like a scene or automation) - it’s only function can be to turn the switch on. This  is INSANE since there is a physical switch right below it.  Who needs a digital representation of the physical button?????  The app further doesn’t allow ANY customization of the switch. You can only do that on the switch itself.With some software updates this switch could be great as it sets up easily, has a great display and with matter could be a great controller.As it stands now it is the world’s prettiest barely connected smart switch."
