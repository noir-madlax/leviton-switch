  "customers_say": "Customers find the relay works well with Hubitat and appreciate its compact design that fits perfectly in 1-gang boxes. The installation process is straightforward, with clear instructions and quick pairing with Home Assistant. The device receives positive feedback for its functionality, with one customer noting it allows switch and relay operations to work independently. However, customers report mixed experiences with reliability, with some units failing after less than two months, and issues with switch input failure. Compatibility is also mixed, with some customers having trouble pairing it with their Z-Wave controllers.AI Generated from the text of customer reviews",

      "review_snippet": "It took me a while to figure out how to pair it with my Home Assistant setup, but I went through their troubleshooting page and got it on the second try.  The final solution  to pairing it was to follow their instructions on their website - not sure if I can link it in this review, but I used DuckDuckGo to search for Zooz 800 ZEN55 \"home assistant\" and followed the instructions on that page.  The final solution was to click the buttons very quickly - I think I was too slow before - and I did a reset (I think) with five quick clicks, then re-added with 3 quick clicks.  The whole thing easily fit back into the smoke detector enclosure, and I tested it and it worked well.It's nice to have the piece of mind of knowing I'll get an alert on my phone if there is an issue, but without the privacy implications of using it with Google or another company."

      "review_snippet": "If you need a 10v dimmer for Zwave home automation this is what you want. If you do not know what a 10v dimmer is then you do not need this. The unit is small and easily fits in a single-gang box with a standard toggle switch. When paring, I was pressing the pair button too slow so if it won't pair then speed up the cadence of the triple press."

There are no default alarms or alerts via home assistant but it was quick and easy for me to create a rule that if the dc detector indicates smoke or fire it will sent an alert to my phone. Tested via the test button on the smoke detector and it sent the alarm every time!"

I have no issues with connectivity and it seems to make the network stronger since it is a wired in node in the network."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2025",
      "review_snippet": "I installed this Mar/2025 smart home device using the SmartThings hub v2. I have nine smoke detectors in my house.On the first link, I pressed the button three times to connect the device to my hub. However, I encountered an issue because the hub connected but didn’t function correctly. After researching, I discovered that I needed to install the Zooz driver first on my hub.When I attempted to update the driver in the hub, I couldn’t switch to the newly installed Zooz driver. Consequently, I had to put the device in exclusion mode and remove it from the hub. Next, I re-added the Zooz relay, and the device connected immediately with the correct driver.The relay produces no noise and fits perfectly in a 1-gang box, even though the box contains three Romex wires."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2023",
      "review_snippet": "Let's start with the positives:* This thing is tiny. It packs two switch inputs and two relays where other manufacturers fit one* The price is about 40% less than other Z-Wave double switches* Lots of options for setup in Home Assistant, though this is a double-edged sword. Keep reading.The negatives:* The wimpy 5A relays put some pretty serious restrictions on where you can use this. A ceiling fan comes close to maxing out the relay rating. Definitely do not connect this thing to a switched outlet or anywhere else you can't guarantee a current draw under 5A. This limitation should be more clearly marked on the packaging. For example, you should definitely not use these to control a switched outlet. Someone might plug in a high current device in that outlet and cause a major problem.* Makes a little bit of a humming/buzzing noise. You won't hear it once the device is squirreled away inside a wall box, but I could definitely hear all three units I bought when I had them hooked up in the open (with all exposed wiring covered in Wago connectors) for pairing.* The default switch setup is a little confusing out of the box. I suspect the most common use for these, by a wide margin, is connecting them to existing light toggle switches. The switch inputs on all three of my units were not set that way by default. I was initially very confused when I got the switches hooked up, flipped the lights on with the physical switch, flipped them off with Home Assistant, and then had to hit the switch twice to get them to turn on again. I had to go into the device options in Home Assistant to get the switch inputs set as toggles (I don't remember what the initial setting was). I have lots of Wi-Fi, Zigbee, and Z-Wave smart switches and these are the only ones that weren't set up for toggle inputs by default. It is a minor issue, but I bet the manufacturer gets a lot of these things returned by confused customers that don't have patience for tinkering.Update: I have installed three units inside wall boxes in my house and all of them have had incidents where they completely stop working until I turn off the circuit breaker and turn it back on. When this happens the unit is unresponsive in Home Assistant AND the physical switch stops working. This is completely unacceptable."
