      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2024",
      "review_snippet": "Sometimes, simplicity is the best upgrade. These light switches are easy to install—no need to call an electrician or panic about wires. The glossy white finish gives a clean, modern look to any room. They fit into standard boxes and come with wall plates, so no extra shopping required. Plus, the self-grounding feature is a nice touch for peace of mind.That said, they’re not exactly revolutionary. It’s a switch, it works, and that's about it. But for the price, it does what it’s supposed to do, and I can't really ask for more than that. Perfect for replacing outdated switches or giving your room a small facelift without breaking the bank."
