      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2020",
      "review_snippet": "I received this product in exchange for my honest review as part of the Amazon Vine Program. Seller AIDA lists these as \"AIDA 15 Amp 4 Way Toggle Switch Self-Grounding Indoor Quiet Turn ON Off Toggle, Residential Grade, UL Listed, Side Wired, 10 Packs, White\". I had a toggle switch fail and decided to give these a try. This 10 pack of Residential Toggle Switches is UL listed. The switches have appropriate J Box screws and screw terminals on each side as well as a ground screw. (Picture 1). These can be used to do 4 way switching with a \"traveler\" wire and come with a diagram. I did find that these switches as noted in their title and description DO NOT have push in wire connector points on the back (Picture 3). This is clearly stated by the seller but it is a fairly standard feature on most switches and outlets and detracts from the overall usefulness and ease of installation rating. Also, close examination shows NO \"ON\" or \"OFF\" letters on the plastic toggle. Most switches have that lettering. The toggle action is firm and positive without a \"snap\" sound like older style toggle switches. Without care one could easily install a switch upside down accidentally - you can tell only by the ground screw located at the switch bottom if you don't pay attention to hot and neutral wire colors. Consequently I have given these a 4 Star rating. Recommended with limits stated."
