As soon as you connect to power, something fries inside the switch. DO NOT PUT THESE POECES OF TRASH IN YOUR WALL! I was not looking for a bargain switch, this was one of the only options for black."

The switch provides both 14AWG quick push-in wiring and 12AWG side wiring. For my installation I used the push-in wiring. The finish of the switches looks good. It's not an issue, but the switches have a really loud on/off click. Overall, you can't go wrong with these switches."
