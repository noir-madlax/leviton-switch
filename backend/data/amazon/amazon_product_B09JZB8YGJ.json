The dimming ability receives mixed feedback - while customers like the dimming option, they report the lights don't dim low enough. Moreover, the functionality and quality show mixed results, with some units working flawlessly while others malfunction after a while and show poor reliability.

      "review_snippet": "Excellent product! I have several Gosund smart  devices and find them to be the most reliable when compared to other brands. I moved into a new home and wanted a dimmer on some recessed lights but also wanted to use it with my Alexa system. The design of the switch with the screw terminals is a space-saving design but having to install the tiny screws that are included is a little inconvenient. I am an electrician by trade so this isn’t a big deal. Setup to Alexa and Gosund app is a simple and fast. Dimming control using Alexa is so convenient, too. I had purchased a Leviton model from HD but took it back because it required another accessory device to work as a 3-way. That is not the case with this model and it works perfectly when installed as the switch with the power feeding the circuit as shown in the device instructions."

I had a rough time installing it in a two and 3-gang box, which is more related to the narrow space switch, wires, connectors, etc. The installation is straightforward; they include all you need for installation, including the wire caps and wall plate. The connection with the GoSund app and Alex was almost instantaneous. I dismissed all wall plates once I kept mine - American standard. The dimmer function is fantastic and works very well. Fancy, too - in the middle of the knob."

      "review_snippet": "Switch was easy wiring diagram. The list of problems goes on: 1) it will ask you to download gosund and register an account that is a hassle. They ask my email(I use hotmail) and would send me a verification code. The code never arrived in my mailbox and wasn't able to register an account. So I just bought a paper weight garbage. I opened a gmail email and I received the so called code and was able to pair my phone gosund app with the smart switch. It works ok if manually operated. Problem 2) It didn't work with 5ghz wifi network but somehow it successfully connected with my wifi but alexa will only have control if you say a full sentence like this \"alexa turn on smart switch\" or \"alexa dim smart switch to ..%percent\". Just not so good product. I will trash this one and go back to the meross smart switches that I had in my other house. I only had to say dim the lights or turn off lights and it worked flawlessly."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2024",
      "review_snippet": "We had one of the switches on previous versions of this product fail. I was hesitant to purchase again because the previous iteration had some quality issues, but we didn't want to replace all of our switches just because one went out, so I purchased again.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised upon receiving the item that the packaging was new, the product looked similar but the quality was much better, the screw holes were standard size (a big problem with a previous version), and all in all I was very happy with the updates. It seemed to be primarily a quality improvement, rather than a complete redesign which meant it fits perfectly with our previously purchased switches (gosund) and it isn't immediately obvious aesthetically that one switch is a different version. Very happy to see a company actually listen to consumer complaints and make quality adjustments."
