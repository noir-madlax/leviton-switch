  "description": "The ENERLITES 83201 3-way toggle switch is a 20A replacement for any commercial grade wall switch. This toggle light switch is easy to install and it is compatible in either single pole or 3-way installations. This expands the range of potential applications, allowing the toggle switch to be installed in 3-way configurations in which a single load is controlled from two separate locations. The wall switch is made from high-quality Polycarbonate Thermoplastic material for high resistance to heat and impacts, and the metal components are made from solid steel. These materials are virtually indestructible, making the switch ideal for longevity in physically demanding applications. This 20A electrical switch is ideal for commercial locations such as schools, stores, restaurants, hotels, and more. It can also be used in residential locations that may require the use of 20A switches for high-power appliances. This light switch is white, but the device is available in a range of unique colors to match virtually any location. Wiring instructions are included. This product is UL listed and includes a one-year warranty.",

      "review_snippet": "Had a light switch that would no longer toggle.  Matched the specs from the installed unit after turning off the circuit breaker and checking for line voltage. Easy 5 minute swap out.  Applied the electrical tape as recommended by an electrician colleague. Would definitely recommend."

It wasn't expensive at all if you do the drywall work yourself.It's worth it. Never have to get annoyed with cheap enclosed light switches."
