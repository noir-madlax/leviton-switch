      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2018",
      "review_snippet": "Several months ago I purchased smart switches for my two chandeliers, but they didn't fit inside the multi-gang boxes I had.  I assumed that all smart switches must be the same, so I then tried using individual smart bulbs in the chandeliers.  That didn't work either.  The bulbs didn't sync correctly.  Each light eventually came on, but sometimes seconds apart and other times had to be turned on from the app manually.  So I once again started looking for a smart switch that could fit into my 3 and 4 gang boxes, which was the best option if they were available.  These are exactly what I was hoping to find!One chandelier is a 3-way, each in 3-gang boxes, and the other was a single pole in a 4-gang box.  My house is less than 4 years old, so I thought the wiring inside the boxes should be fairly easy work with...but it wasn't. I had to call the Leviton customer support several times for help.  They were great!  They said most non-electricians needed their help, and they were happy to walk us through the installation process.  Part of my confusion was that I had so many wires inside each box....as many as 10 separately capped wires in one box, many with the same color wires that didn't mean the same thing.  (whites that weren't neutral, blacks that weren't loads or hot, and reds that weren't travelers). But with their help, I finally figured out what the electrician had done and was able to install them myself.  I'm very happy with the results!One more thing I'll mention is that one of the most difficult thing you'll have to do is get all the wires and caps back inside the boxes behind the large switches (all my switches are 3-ways, dimmers, and/or smart switches, so they are all very large) without breaking the switches or disconnecting any of the wires.  So make sure all your connections are very tight and secure before pushing them back into the boxes.Just noticed in the picture that one plate was missing a screw...lol!  Found it on the floor."

      "review_snippet": "I just finished adding a couple of DD0SR-DZL switches in combination with DW15S-1BZ switches (these are Leviton's WiFi switches, but this review should also work with their hub based switches like z-wave).  Some general observations...- I found the switches to work exactly as advertised.  Note, they do require a cover plate, but they come with both white and cream colored switch plates.- These are secondary switches which work with master switches in 3-way and 4-way circuits.  YOU MUST ALSO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE MASTER SWITCH.- I find the switches to be solid with good wiring connections.  They feel better designed for American circuits than some cheaper Chinese switches I've installed.- As others have noted, they do require a neutral wire.  However, at least with a 3-way circuit, if you have a neutral at one switch box in the circuit, you still should be able to make it work with a little thought.  See my comment in the questions section.- I added these to work with Amazon Echo.  Connecting the master wifi switches to Echo was simple and quick.- This biggest problem I had was finding space in the electrical box that holds the switch.  The switch itself is larger than the equivalent non-smart switch.  It still fits in but takes away space from the mass of wires you have in the electrical box.  Add the additional wire(s) for the neutral, and I was running out of space to fit everything in.  I did do it, but it was a pain.  Note, I'm betting a professional electrician has the experience and knowledge of how to pack everything into the box easily, I just didn't have that experience (although it got a little better as I went on)."
