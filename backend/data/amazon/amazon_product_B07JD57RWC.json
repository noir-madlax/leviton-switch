The new switch has it clearly marked where each goes.I don't know if it was because the switch controls four lights, but I could not get these to dim as much as I expected. It worked, but the dimming effect was about 1/2 what I expected. I will try this in a spot where only one or two lights are dimmed and see if I get a wider range of dimming.Review of: TOPGREENER Kalide 0-10V Dimmer Light Switch"
