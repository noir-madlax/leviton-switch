  "customers_say": "Customers find the smart switch works well with HomeKit and Siri, is easy to install with simple wiring, and integrates perfectly with Alexa. However, the WiFi connectivity is problematic, with customers reporting random disconnections. Moreover, the switch's functionality receives mixed feedback, with some praising it as an excellent dual switch while others report units failing within three weeks. Additionally, the light level and build quality also get mixed reviews, with some finding it amazing while others report issues, and opinions on value for money are divided between those who find it reasonably priced and those who consider it a waste of money.AI Generated from the text of customer reviews",

Put the bulb the their aplication said on all recess lamps 25 of them and all of them twinkle nervously. So I decided to try this ones for a fraction of the cost and for the past two years they have been excellent. No twinkle. Easy install today I install the last two. Now all my house is using these switches!! They even come with the face plate. I really recommend this smart dimmers."

I replaced it with this device hoping the programming was as easy as other home automated products.Winner!  Easy programming.  We set the ON time to be at dark and it automatically changes each day and with DST.We have Google Fiber.  (I know, they’re invasive, but we got it anyway.)  Easiest connection of any I’ve done.Bought another for our garage accent light, which had a toggle switch, so we weren’t using it.  These little fellas fixed a big problem for us."

Even at high setting, the sensor triggers at about 10 feet.  If I am at the far end of the room (approx 20' away) I need to be half way into the room before the light goes on.Nothing about settings in instructions.  Would be nice to confirm what settings really mean in Smartlife app.No problem with wifi setup."

I bought this product in late January. I bought about 5 of these switches for my house. Within about 6 months I started to notice that the physical switch started to act funny and not consistently work but I figure it was a fluke. Two months later now all 5 switches stopped physically working. Now I’m stuck either spending a small fortune to replace all the switches with another brand of switches so the physical functionality will work or I have to use my assistant/app to turn on lights in my house if I want to see at night. Im pretty annoyed and I wanted people to be aware that you’re going to be left stranded in this situation if you buy these switches since I’m pretty confident they all do it since all 5 of my switches are duds now."

      "review_snippet": "I've installed well over 100 IoT devices, primarily for Alexa integration. I had just tried an Aqara dual switch with no success (the hub read 2 switched but only passed one to Alexa) and this no-name-brand, especially with generic \"Smart Life\" app, had me doubting success. Wow--it hooked up so fast and easy (1 slight issue discussed later), even easier than my go-to TP-Link brand (no dual switch choice though) on both the App and Alexa discovery. Both switches Alexa responsive (no Master/Slave button or Grouping issues). The one minor set-up is that it lost it's set-up mode while I was reading instructions. I still had outlet open so I disconnected hot to reset (otherwise it wanted me to go through entire routine) so I suggest you be willing to add quickly to Smart Life to avoid the pairing timeout. After install I killed and restored the breaker to check its power outage recovery (a weak point for many brands) and it restored admirably. Very surprised and pleased with performance and granted a VERY rare 5 stars by me."

      "review_snippet": "This dual switch would be great if not for poor wifi reception and it doesn't stay connected to wifi network. I used this control my yard landscaping lights so it needed to turn on at night and off in morning. Using a Google Home routine, it would turn on less than half the time. And likewise in morning, it would off less than half the time.This dual switch was mounted next to a Treatlife single switch and replaced a prior Treatlife switch. I never had any issues with these Treatlife switches in over the past year that they were mounted in this same location. So it is not a router wifi problem. This switch is the problem.It's too bad that this dual switch has such a poor wifi interface because I really wanted to put a regular outlet next to this dual switch.I also tried a dual Youngzuth smart switch but it also had poor wifi reception, however it was even worse in that it wouldn't ever automatically reconnect once it lost wifi connection until I manually reset it.I ultimately had to remove this dual switch and a dumb outlet so that I could go back to 2 separate Treatlife smart wifi switches which are working flawlessly right now.The labeling on the back of the switch is incorrect and shows lack of attention to detail in the design. The black wire's Line In is labeled the same text as one of the brown Load1 outputs, hence there are two wires labeled as \"L/Load1\" and one of them is actually the Line In. The other brown wire is correctly labeled \"Load2\"."
