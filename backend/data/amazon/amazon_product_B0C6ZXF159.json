Moreover, the app compatibility receives positive feedback, with one customer noting it's particularly suitable for beginner smart homes. However, the dimming capability receives mixed reviews - while some customers say it keeps LED lamps from flashing at low brightness levels, others report it doesn't work at all. Additionally, connectivity and value for money also receive mixed feedback, with some customers reporting connection issues and considering it a waste of money, while others find it affordable.AI Generated from the text of customer reviews",

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2025",
      "review_snippet": "I have bought many of these and nearly the entire house now uses Meross switches for lighting.These are relatively simple to install. You absolutely must have a neutral wire in any switch box in the wall in order to use these. While a neutral wire (typically white) is present in most switch boxes, one might not be present in older homes (built before 1985 or so). These will fit in a standard sized switch box, but if you have an unusually shallow switch box, they won't fit.The installations instructions are quite clear, and several videos available showing how to install this, some by Meross, and some by others.After installation, initially the device is connected to and controlled by the Meross app. It is very easy to connect the device to the Meross app by following the instructions in the app. Once you have connected it to the Meross app, you can follow instruction in the Meross app to integrate the device into Alexa. If you have already connected the Meross app to Alexa for previous Meross devices, the new device will immediately work with Alexa. You can even remove the Meross app from your mobile device and Alexa will still properly control the switch and other Meross devices. (This also works with Apple Homekit, but I have not used that and so I can't speak to that.)The switch and dimmer buttons work perfectly with my LED lighs. The dimmer requires some slight additional setup in the Meross app.The tactile click of the switch and the dimmer buttons is a major plus. I used to use a more expensive brand that did not have the click and I found it very annoying.Up to maybe twice a year, one of the switches seems to lose track of whether it is on or off. For example, if the light is off and I say \"Alexa, turn on office light\", Alexa responds, but the lights don't turn on. This is because the switch seems to think the lights are already on. To fix it, I just say \"Alexa, turn off office light\", followed by \"Alexa, turn on office light\". Then the lights turn on properly.Please note: some people will tell you that in lieu of a neutral wire, you can just use the ground wire. DO NOT USE GROUND IN LIEU OF A NEUTRAL. If you don't have a neutral wire in the switch box, have an electrician run one in the wall from the nearest outlet. No current should be flowing through your house ground. That could lead to electrical shocks or even a fire, and it is not legal.Pros:1. Clear installation and setup instructions (including numerous videos available)2. Nice tactile click when you press the switch or dimmer buttons.3. Excellent quality - I have installed about 25 of these and every one worked right away and all are still functioning fine up to three years after install.4. No hub needed when using with Alexa.5. Much less expensive compared to other brands but device appears solidly made.6. Comes with a fancy screwless cover plate for a smooth look.Cons:1. Very rarely switch seems to lose track of its status, but easily fixed.2. Cannot be installed in an unusually shallow switch box.3. Requires a neutral wire which may not be available in older home switch boxes.I obviously recommend this switch as I keep buying more to add to the home."

      "review_snippet": "Easy to install/configure like the rest of the Meross switches.  I have a mixture of the Meross single pole dimmers, 3-way dimmers and standard smart switches and all work very well with HomeKit.  A few weeks ago I started to run into some issues with the MSS560s and their operation via HomeKit, specifically once the switch was dimmed then powered off, the switch would not turn back on at 100% using HomeKit.  Opened a case with Meross support via their app/email and after some back and forth with support, they were able to push an updated/beta/unreleased FW to all the 560 switches resolving the HomeKit synchroniztion issue.  Meross support was fantastic and really easy to work with.  Note:  I was using the latest FW (4.3.6) and support was able to update all the single pole dimmers (560s) to 4.3.7 which install fixed all the HomeKit sync issues I was running into."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2025",
      "review_snippet": "After HomeKit (os 18.3)  setup I could turn on/off and dim using the HK interface but it would fail to respond during a home automation or it would show the device as on when in fact is was off or vice verse. I verified through the Meross app that I was running latest firmware (4.3.6) but despite multiple resets, connecting/reconnecting to HK and frustration, nothing worked. I was about to ditch the whole thing when I sent a support request to Meross and was pleasantly surprised to receive a response the following day indicating they were familiar with my symptoms and could send me a private firmware update. (I'm still not clear why a known issue like this isn't being resolved by a public firmware release.) In order to get the firmware fix I had to send them the dimmer's HK code and connect the dimmer to their app after which they pushed firmware 4.3.7. This all took place over a week's time but in the end it fixed all the issues I was experiencing and the dimmer has since been working flawlessly. Only to say, kudos to Meross for standing behind their product!I'm giving 4/5 stars and taking 1 star away for all the hassles and for the fact that the dimmer buttons on the switch don't let you \"slide\" through light intensity.  Each tap of the up or down button increases or decreases the light in 20% increments. (Maybe they can improve on that with a future firmware update.)"
