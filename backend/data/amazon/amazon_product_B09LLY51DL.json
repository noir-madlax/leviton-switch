      "review_snippet": "I love the option to turn the lights off with an app from another room. The dimmer is easy to install, but as described it utilizes a neutral wire. I had to run a new wire since I was replacing a single-pole switch (standard toggle switch).These look simple and modern which is the reason I chose them."
