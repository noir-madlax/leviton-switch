      "review_snippet": "We have a ranch style house with long center hallway between the two ends. In the hallway there are two sets of 3-way switches which are probably 40 years old and were begging to be replaced. Each had a tiny orange glowing light in the paddles that would illuminate when they were off. All it would do at night is let you know where the light switch was. The hallway itself was still pitch dark and so we'd still need to turn a light on to see our way.These new switches are exactly what was needed to update/upgrade the old switches. The amount of light given off when at night is wonderful - perfect to provide enough light in the hallway without turning on the lights.During the day, there isn't much light getting to a couple of the switches and so they remain on all day as well. That's fine as the power consumption is pretty insignificant.Very happy with these switches at this point. Hopefully they will last."
