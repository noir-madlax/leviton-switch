The functionality receives mixed feedback - while it works well with Alexa and the SmartLife app, some report it stops working. Moreover, connectivity issues are common, with devices frequently disconnecting from the internet. Additionally, the switch's reliability is concerning, with multiple units failing after a month of use. The light level and app quality also receive mixed reviews, with customers noting a very dim green indicator light and mixed opinions about the app's quality.AI Generated from the text of customer reviews",

      "review_snippet": "I have lots of Gosund smart plugs and have had no problems with them, so I didn't hesitate to get Gosund smart switches.I had one issue: my router has both 5G and 2.4G networks, but both have the same wifi name, and I can't directly control which speed my phone uses when it connects: it always picks 5G if I'm close enough to my router.  However, these devices only work if your phone is connected to the 2.4G network.  The instructions explain how to give your 5G and 2.4G networks different names, but that's old-school; things have gotten better these days.The good news is, there's a workaround (and it's sad that the instructions don't mention this.)  I had to pair the devices at the end of an extension cord, outside my house.  I brought up my (Android) phone's wifi settings and clicked on my network name, which showed the current status (5G vs 2.4G, and signal strength, etc.)  I found a place where the connection went from 5G to 2.4G, and walked a bit farther in that direction.I put a wire nut on the switch's red wire and plugged the black and white wires into the extension cord, watching the LED on the switch to make sure it was connected.  I then followed the instructions.I believe it would have worked fine to install the switches first, and then just walk with my phone out to the same spot (no extension cord.)  But I wanted to make sure they'd work before wiring them in.  Plus it's helpful (though not necessary) to be nearby so I can see the LEDs during the process.Once paired, there is no need for my phone to be on the 2.4G network, and after installation, everything works perfectly.  Integration with Google Home is easy; once you give the permissions between Google and the Smart Life app, any Smart Life devices automatically appear in Google Home.  (The only problem with the Smart Life app is that it does NOT provide a way to move a device to a new home: you have to delete it and add it again.  That was a nuisance when I moved.  In the future I won't be using the \"home\" features of Smart Life.  But this is not Gosund's fault, and it's not really a problem because I can use the Google app's features for which device is in which home.)I have other smart devices that don't need my phone to be on a 2.4G network, and that saves a bit of trouble, so while I like Gosund products, I doubt I'll be buying more of these particular switches."

These switches are fantastic and a fraction of the cost of some other brands. The installation was quick and straightforward, and they connected to the app immediately without any hassle.The integration with Alexa and Google Home works seamlessly, and it’s been so convenient to control the lights with voice commands or through the app. The switches are UL certified, which adds peace of mind, and the 4-pack is a great value for the price.If you’re looking to make the switch from other expensive brands, these are highly recommended for their reliability, ease of use, and affordability!"

I can turn my lights on and off with the power of my mind..which controls the switches by sending electric impulses from my brain to my mouth in the form of words (jealous much..i know you are!)And the best part? I didn't even need to hire a fancy electrician to install it. The whole thing took about 15 minutes, including removing the old switch, installing and pairing it on my phone.\"Hey Google, turn on the family room lights,\" a wave of odd awesomeness (AUsomeness), came over me and the lights turned on and I couldn’t help but smirk like a 5 year old kid. Setting up timers, and schedules makes things easy. And lets be real, when its 1230am and im about to lose myself in a simpsons mini marathon, me settingIts not actually being lazy, I didn’t get the switches because im too lazy to turn off the lights, I got the switches for energy management, as well as better living through technology, as you can see from my other reviews, im a bit of a tech junky/nerd. These switches will hopefully allow me to reallocate my resources to focus on other pressing matters…like global domination from my amazon reviews. Someone sponsor me already, caaaamaaaan!! 180k annually (to start) along with other perks is all I ask for. Looking forward to getting messages on how I can be a professionally reviewer."
