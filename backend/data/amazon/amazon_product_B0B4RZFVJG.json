      "review_snippet": "I'm thinking i might have received a Returned item. Had a weird \"burnt\" plastic (circuit board) smell. Used one and worked fine. Hooked up a bathroom heat/vent/light combo. One switch i hooked up the vent (to one switch) and light (to other switch).Then installed the other switch on my main bathroom light and wired in the heater portion, that way I don't max out the amperage on one circuit.At first the second install, i had put the \"line\" to the brass screw and the \"loads\" to the other switch's (heater and light respectively). Turned on the breaker then one on the switch and both the heater and light came on. It baffled me for a good while. I rechecked all my wiring in the gang box and in the attic for the heat/vent/light combo. All wiring was correct.Then i went out to Lowes to buy another, Eaton, hooked it up and i did the same thing. So i decided to read the instructions very carefully. It stated, \"to run the single pole double switch as two INDEPENDANTLY switches, break off the copper tab between the two loads!\"That was the KEY! i looked on the Eaton switch and this one and sure enough on the load side, there it was. I took my flathead screwdriver, small, and wedged it in per the instructions and a simple up, down, and back up again then the tab broke off.Now it works fine.How i know this was prob a returned item? The first switch i installed, i didn't have to break the load tabs off because someone else did it for me!They work great now after about 2hrs of troubleshooting, climbing up and down from the attic, turning on and off the breakers to switch the line wires around ect...The single pole 3 switch didn't have the break off tab so idk what gives? It's not like this is or was a 2-way switch configuration.But in the end, lesson learned and experience / wisdom was gained."
