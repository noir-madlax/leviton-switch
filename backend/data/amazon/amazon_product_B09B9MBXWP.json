The no LED light side connects to the plug direction.  .  If you want the LED light ALWAYS ON, then connect the LED light toward the plug direction.There is a connect hole under the connect screw head. Don’t need to wrap the wire around the connect screw.  Just insert the wire into the hole then tighten up the screw.  This is very user friendly and easy."

If you have never installed a switch like this before, make sure you read the directions and watch a few videos online. :)Prior to buying this switch, I was using a cube switch, which was cumbersome and often fell off. I had to keep taping it to the door jamb.*Indicator Light* this switch has an indicator light. You can install it two ways; depending on the direction you install it, the indicator light either a. stays on all the time, or b. turns on when the light is turned off.I love being able to see the switch. My closet is completely dark otherwise.Highly recommend. It's attractive and does the job."

I purchased these because of the higher amp rating than others have figuring extra means better. Time will tell on the longevity of the switch, but it's on and working... with extreme difficulty!!  And, it's not set up for a 3 wire system which is insane.I was hoping to put eyelet's on the wires, but there's not enough room for them... so I went with bare 'braided' wires and spent over an hour trying to get the wire inserted into the tiny connectors with only about 1/2\" of wiring to hold on too. It's the 'push and pray' method if the wire would go in the connector or not... and most of the time it didn't.Minor \"intelligent\" changes would make it much-much easier to install the wiring and accommodate a 3 wire power cord. I cannot exactly 'not' recommend these switches as they may work great, but just be aware that putting the wires in them will definitely test your patience."
