Moreover, they consider it well worth the investment. However, the functionality and compatibility with Alexa receive mixed reviews, with some reporting it doesn't work as advertised and others unable to connect it to Alexa. Additionally, the dimming feature receives mixed feedback, with customers noting it doesn't perform as well as most dimmers, and several customers report issues with their lights flickering when using the switch.AI Generated from the text of customer reviews",

It's also apparently Alexa compatible, but I didn't need that.If you want the most reliable operation of this (or any) remote control, especially at greater distance, 2.4 is the way to go. You do not need the additional bandwidth 5GHz can provide in order to operate a light switch although this item does provide that frequency, and, if used in the same room as the switch, the remote should never have any trouble."
