      "review_snippet": "These are builder grade 3-way paddle light switches and the cover plates are not included. They are decent quality but not great, definitely not top grade and they have a lightweight tactile feel to them. They work correctly for me, so far. One of my pet peeves is the cheaper quality of the screw terminals.  The picture shows that on this switch the terminal connector is just a single clamp screw, while better-quality devices have a clamping plate which allows placing 2 wires under the plate.  Per the National Electric Code, there can only be 1 wire attached under each screw head, so these switches are somewhat less convenient to use in a busy electrical box. These are OK 3-way paddle switches, not the best but acceptable if you don't require the best quality."

I have the brushed black Samsung Washer/ Dryer set. I had ordered this type of plate from others and had to return...quality issues. These are flawless and are a good value for the money. They are easy to install. They have the screws and the holes in the back. My old switch had some wires in the hole and some on the screw...I kept the same configuration using these. They look expensive and functionality is easy ....top part is on and bottom part is off. I have ordered 2 packs of these as I am redoing my whole house..the outlets and wall switches."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024",
      "review_snippet": "These Lider 3-way switches are excellent quality and are delivered in 10 individual boxes. The white matt color is very attractive. These switches are made for those of us who don't favor bright white. The 4 screws on the switches are good quality with strong threads that don't refuse to screw in when needed.  I rated 5 stars on easy to install but 3-way switches are a challenge to install and take a lot of thinking.  The directions actually make sense, which is rare, so the installation should be no problem. I will spend the extra money and purchase the wire that is made for hooking up 3-way switches. Running an extra wire and trying to just figure out what went where nearly put me under on the last house I built. An electrician I am not but I have studied and know how to wire a house and successfully carried that task out a couple of times (other than the 3-way switches, I had to call the posse for help wiring them in). I do appreciate having these switches and the logical instructions that were included. We are in the process of building our house, so I haven't installed these switches yet. In comparison to box stores this box of switches costs $16.81 less than the same item at the big L. Don't hesitate to purchase these switches. They are top quality."
