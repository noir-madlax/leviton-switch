AVOID!This dimmer switch has an INSANE delay when shutting off the light, after pressing the off button there is a 2-3 second delay before anything happens at all.

They're basically waiting to see if you'll be pressing and holding the button to dim it BEFORE doing anything at all, which is so bad for the user experience.There is also a Parameter 16 which when set to 1 will make this dimmer act like a normal on/off switch, BUT when you set this parameter to 1 then z-wave controls fail to turn it off!!!"

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 15, 2024",
      "review_snippet": "Update:Taking one more star off as I found a better alternative and seeing how this can be done, I can't leave this review with 4 stars. Basically the superior product to this is Zooz 800 Series Dimmers and Switches. They have much more options and configurability, but what is most important they send the events INSTANTLY. This really matters for smart home automations, especially with lights when you want them to turn on or off in synchronized matter. I'm replacing all of my dimmers with Zooz products.Original review:Below is my review of the 500 series unit with updates to the 700 series unit from this purchase.I used this with Home Assistant -> Was able to pair it without any problems. Details how it works:1. If you set it to a switch mode, it will turn the light fully on and off very fast after pressing the button on the switch, but you can still change the brightness from Home Assistant, so you can have a mix where the lights turn on instantly (rather than slowly get brighter).This used to work with 500 series, with the 700 series if I have the dimmers in switch mode and try to control from Home Assistant, weird things happen the light stays on and I can't turn it off until I hold the off button on the switch, I saw some comments about some similar weird behavior like this. The workaround that I find acceptable for my use case is to actually keep the dimmers in dimmer mode (so when you press the button on the switch the light will turn on a bit slower as it will dim from 0 to the set brightness, while before you could turn it on instantly and then dim to lower brightness with automation)2. 500 series used to have this: The switch has an option if it should dim fast or slowly -> the fast option is still too slow for me... Upgrade idea: Just add a numeric field that will be multiplied by 100ms to get the dimming speed (so value of 10 == 1 sec on/off time or something like this).The 700 series no longer have the option to configure dimming speed: fast or slow. Feels like it is dimming with the 'fast' speed (comparing to 500 series) so the removed feature doesn't bother me too much.3. But the switch listens to the \"transition time\" parameter from home assistant, so you can still modify this and have it dim fast or slow, depending on automation.4. 500 series only had: the option to turn the indicator light always off or always on.The 700 series expanded this: The LED is now multicolor, you can pick the color so now you can encode some messages with automation: My example when my bathroom fan is on due to high humidity, I would like to show a different color LED on the switch to indicate that it is running in automatic mode rather than manually turned on.5. It supports events:- key press/key release (so you can make automations based on how long & which key was pressed)- double press (on each on and off button)- triple press (on each on and off button)So it can be used to also control other lights or enter some scenes or even to control smart blinds if needed.6. Doesn't buzz with the fixtures/light bulbs in my house. I tested it with Philips LED bulbs (older CREE bulbs that I had were buzzing a little still).7. Other features:- allows you to invert the button meaning- 3 way mode works with the add on switch as well as the old school 3-way switch, you can pick the mode in the option (I still prefer their add on switch as it also supports double/triple/hold events)- has a guidelight mode, but haven't tried it yetThe bad:1. The 500 series had this issue: The default network leave sequence is: triple press on + triple press off: But this is the problem, both triple presses can mean something, so if you triple press to turn an extra lamp on and try to turn it on and off you might accidentally leave the Z-Wave network...The 700 series resolved this! Now you open the air gap and close it while holding the 'off' position. That then cycles through all LED colors and resets the switch, so it also leaves the Z-Wave network.2. Like for most Z-Wave products, the price is a little higher than I would wish, especially comparing with existing WiFi and ZigBee products on the market. But honestly the reliability and speed and lack of WiFi congestion issues still made me try to switch my house to Z-Wave and so far I'm going forward."
