They are well made. They operate smoothly. They can be installed with the traditional wire wrapped around a screw or by inserting the straight wire into the switch. These are easy to insert. Some switches I have used in the past did not leave a wide enough diameter hole for normal gauge wires. These were perfect for what I needed."
