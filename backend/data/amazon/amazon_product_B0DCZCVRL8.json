      "review_snippet": "The 15A, 120V single pole light switch from Amico is well-built and UL listed.  The switch’s toggle-action is smooth and secure.  The screw terminals are properly sized and easy to secure.  Frame dimensions and color are an exact match for standard paddle-type switches.  It also comes with a matching single-gang cover plate, but I didn’t use it as I was installing this in an existing double-gang box.  As you can see in the photos, this Amico switch as a replacement for a broken switch at home.  This common failure occurred at the plastic “hinge point” in the center of the switch.  It makes the paddle loose on one side, leading to a poor internal electrical connection - and eventually arcing or failure of the lights to come on.  This new switch appears to be sturdier in its construction, so I am hopeful that it will last longer than the low-quality one it replaced."
