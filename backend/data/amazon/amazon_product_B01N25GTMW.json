      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2020",
      "review_snippet": "First off, it's incredible to find well-made 3-way switches for this price. It's cheaper than the local hardware store, and their build quality is very nice. The switches are packaged nicely, with protection from scratches or damage, so you're sure to get perfect switches.I've installed about 30 of these throughout my home, and none have had any quality issues or other problems. I ordered these since I have many 3-way switches and many single-pole switches throughout the house, and didn't want to bother juggling both kinds, especially given the price of these.I only have 2 minor complaints about these - the flip motion, and the click.The flip motion is smooth, however on every switch, the flip in the upward direction has an ambiguous state... you can flip it partially up, and it stays that way. I'm not sure if this is a safety issue or not (I don't know if the electrical part has partially engaged or not, as it would on a toggle switch). Strangely, this behavior does not occur when switching it in the downward position - depending on the force applied, it'll either flip down completely or not.Click is relatively loud, and there is no way to flip the switch without the click. Other decorator switches I've used can be \"palmed\" or switched very gently without making a sound. Not with these. It's not a big issue, but if you're trying to sneak around small children, it's a consideration. They are by no means loud though, and I'd still recommend these.Overall, they are nearly perfect, and you cannot beat the price. Highly recommended!"
