I had some trouble setting up the 2nd switch.  They replaced both switches.  The setup problem turned out to be me trying to use on a light with 4 switches.  This requires 4way switches and this device doesn't work properly if there are 4way switches in the circuit.  So it was really user error.  They worked closely with me to figure this out and they were prompt and polite in our debug conversation.  When installed with a light with 2 switches, the only configuration they support, the switch setup and operates smoothly and easily."

      "review_snippet": "For years I have been a Leviton guy and to some degree I still am. But Leviton are expensive so I tried some Kasa and this Gosund. It replaces a 3 way smart dimmer Leviton that could not be controlled from the companiok switch any longer after 6 years. I like about the GS that it works just fine in a 3 way config. Also it has a leg up to my Leviton which caused Leds to flicker until they were warm. This doesn't. The app is a little simplistic but good enough. Best app to me is Kasa with a very very close Leviton second. Anyway here is what's not so great about this GS switch. It's cheap and it looks cheap. The dimmer indicators also look much cheaper than pictured. It also feels cheap. It's some matte porous plastic That you need to insert the terminal screws yourself is also cheap. But for the price I am quite happy so far. I have it only for 2 days. The switch and regular three way is $25 whereas the Leviton set it replaces is more like $65. This GS uses 2 regular travelers. The Leviton can get away with 1. Overall I am happy."

      "review_snippet": "If I could give these dimmer switches zero stars, I would. I’ve gone through four of the GHome 3-way smart dimmer switches, and every single one failed within 1 to 4 months. On top of that, I also installed a 4-pack of their single pole dimmers in another room—and had the same exact issue. It's incredibly frustrating.What’s even more confusing is that the regular GHome smart switches I’ve had throughout my home for years work perfectly. The problem seems to be just with the dimmers. I’d switch to another brand, but then all my switches wouldn’t match. To make matters worse, I’m out of the return window, so I’m stuck with a bunch of broken switches. Just awful. Do yourself a favor and stay away from these."

When I installed this switch and flipped the breaker on the light came on and the breaker tripped after approximately 3 seconds.  After several attempt of switching the traveler wire back and forth I gave up and put a dumb 3 way switch back to original wiring.  I took the gosund switch to another 3 way switch which had a working and installed with no problem.I called customer service at gosund and explained the problem and the only thing I could think of was the neutral wire I was using was from another circuit in the same 3 gang  box (two of the light in that box are on another circuit).  The customer service guy I was talking with ask me to send a picture showing the way I wired it and the box to which I said no I wasn't going to reinstall the switch and pull all those wire out when I all needed was a simple answer to my question about the neutral wire.  He asked for my email address and said he already had my phone number.  To date I have received no answer which is over a week.  I would like to buy another switch but won't unless I know it has a chance of working.  So inconclusion the switch works great but customer service is not the best."
