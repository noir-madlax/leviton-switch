      "review_snippet": "This dimmer switch fits easily into multiple wall switch box. Relatively easy to install although wires are not secure in the plug-in connectors on back of the dimmer case. The dimming limiting feature does not operate as stated and is really useless as it doesn't work. However the unit does dim the lights from bright to completelny of with no flickering. It's OK, but would not purchase again.Updated: called Aida Customer Service about the dimming setting feature. They emailed a detailed instruction message to me that was a bit different than what came with the switch. My desired dim setting is now set, and I'm adding a star due to the follow through from this seller! I'm now pleased with the product, and can recommend this dimmer. Works great in my 3-gang switch box. Thank you."
