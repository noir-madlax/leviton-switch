The build quality and value for money receive mixed reviews, with some finding it nicely made while others describe it as poorly made and not worth the cost. The dimming capability and flickering issues show mixed results - while some report no more flickering LEDs, others mention the lights don't dim properly. The fan speed control receives negative feedback, with customers reporting that the fans don't vary speed and the switch knob breaks off.AI Generated from the text of customer reviews",

As a DIYer, I found the swap from my old switch to this one straightforward. The installation was simple enough for anyone, even if you're not super handy.The 3-speed settings allow for great customization of airflow, and the LED dimmer feature enhances the ambiance in the room perfectly. It’s been working flawlessly since installation, providing smooth operation for both the fan and lights.Overall, this switch is an excellent upgrade for anyone looking to enhance their ceiling fan functionality. Highly recommend it for a quick and easy home improvement!"

Arguably they probably get rough use, but I cannot attest to this because I'm not present. What I can say is that stuff breaks more often in the rental than in my own house.  Nevertheless, the little levers on these switches can and do break off and I've had to replace.  I still like the product because they solve a number of challenges with functionality."
