      "review_snippet": "I have one of these next to every sink in the house to trigger my on-demand hot water heater's recirculation feature.  They fit in a Decora Wall Plate so they look great.  I used a label printer so mark them as hot water.  The recirculation system is 12V DC, daisy-chained wire that links all the sinks, showers, tubs, washing machines, etc. in the house.  Any momentary contact triggers the hot water heater's recirculation feature.The recirculation feature eliminates running cold water down the drain while waiting for hot water to arrive by filling the pipes with hot water before you open the tap."

      "review_snippet": "I got this to use for our Sink Waste Disposer.  It is easy to install, goes in just like any other light switch.  I looks like a standard Decora style light switch, but works as a momentary on switch.  When you press the upper part of the switch (aka ON) the switch is active for as long as you hold it.  Release and its off.  Pressing the lower part of the switch (aka OFF) doesn't do anything.  For our use this works perfectly, to turn on the disposer, just press the ON part of the switch, and hold it for as long as you want the disposer to be on for, when you are done, release the switch and the disposer turns off.  It would be a great switch for anything that you want to have on just for a moment while you're at the switch.  And, since it looks just like a standard Decora switch, it blends in perfectly."

Worked perfectly to make it a smart switch for the exhaust when the kids forget to turn it on and it is humid in there.My only complaint is the click is of pushing the switch is a little louder than I'd like. Otherwise, it's great, not much bigger than a regular toggle switch inside the gang box, and easy to install."
