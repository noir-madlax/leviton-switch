      "review_snippet": "This is a great value pack for updating the light switches in your home. I just bought a house and due to close at the end of this month. I love black accents and accessories and thought these would be perfect for the new house. Out with the white, in with the black. Black looks more modern and is cleaner. White shows dirt too well and if it stains from ink, grease, paint then there's not much I can do aside from swapping it for a new switch. I tend to use black switch covers as well so this will make everything look seamless. Easy to install and at less than 2 bucks per switch you really can't pass this one up."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2024",
      "review_snippet": "In the photo I show an example of one of the twelve switches that I used to control a ceiling fan. Since the fan has no light I only needed a single switch. The switch operates well. I have three more fans and some lights to do with the other switches. Just be careful with the mounting screws. They used some real cheap ones and they can strip real easy, especially if you install them in a plastic box which resists the screw turning more and more as you screw it in. I had to replace the original set on the first one switch that I used because they stripped so badly that I couldn't screw them in all the way. I stripped them with the Phillips head so I switched to the flat head and that also stripped the screws too. Didn't take much. The screws that came with the switches were much lighter than the ones I had lying around. Low quality metal. Not so much an issue in metal boxes that thread smoothly with little resistance. I took off one star for the subpar screws. Otherwise pretty god value for the set."

They not only look good compared to my much older ones they replaced but they all work great to.  My older ones prob going on 25 plus years now def needed replacing.  Feels so nice to have a good solid switch again that isn’t so loose they turn on and off by barely a touch.  Also nice to replace the ones that were cracked.  So happy was able to find these in bulk as seen."
