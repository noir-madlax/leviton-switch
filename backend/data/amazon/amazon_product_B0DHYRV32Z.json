We normally set the upper slider for a day or night setting and leave it alone, using the bottom horizontal switch to turn the lights on/off...  It does a good job of controlling the LED light bulbs over the full range, no flickers or null spots. Easy install and excellent directions too."

Once you get it installed, there is an adjustment knob on the side of the slider. Be sure to adjust this before putting the plate on.I installed my switch to control a ceiling fan light combination. I don't run the fan much so my intent was never to run the fan with the bulbs dimmed. However, even with the adjustment knob and the slider turned all the way up, the fan motor sounds like it is starving for power. That being said, I will switch it back to a standard switch, but the dimmable switch does what it says it does great. Smooth action on the slider and smooth transition of light brightness once you have the adjustment done correctly. I reccommend this item."

If we need it brighter or dimmer we can adjust it too.My biggest issue with the old switches is that my 5 year old would turn the dial down until they thought the light was off but it wasn't actually off. With the new switches it's a definitive on/ off."
