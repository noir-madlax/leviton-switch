      "review_snippet": "Product Review: Smart Light Switch 3 Gang Smart SwitchI recently had the pleasure of trying out the Smart Light Switch 3 Gang Smart Switch, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in terms of ease of installation, connectivity, and overall functionality. Here's my review of this impressive smart switch.First and foremost, the installation process for the Smart Light Switch was a breeze. With clear instructions and a user-friendly design, I was able to replace my existing switch without any hassle. The switch fit perfectly into the wall plate, and the included screws and wiring caps made the installation even easier. Even for someone with minimal electrical experience, I found the installation process straightforward and stress-free.Connecting the switch to the accompanying app was equally as seamless. By following the provided instructions, I was able to establish a connection between the switch and my smartphone within minutes. The app itself was intuitive and user-friendly, allowing me to control the switch effortlessly. When setting schedules, the app provided a range of features that made managing my lights a breeze.The sleek design of the Smart Light Switch also deserves a mention. Its modern and minimalistic look blends seamlessly with my home decor, adding a touch of sophistication to my living space. The switch itself feels sturdy and well-made, and the responsive touch buttons provide a satisfying tactile experience.When it comes to controlling the switch with the app, I found the experience to be smooth and hassle-free. Whether I was turning the lights on and off remotely or setting up conditional schedules, the app responded promptly without any glitches or delays. The connection remained stable, allowing me to control the switch reliably from anywhere within the world.One aspect worth noting is that the Smart Light Switch 3 Gang Smart Switch requires a stable 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi connection to function properly. So, it's important to ensure that your home network is reliable for a seamless experience.In conclusion, the Smart Light Switch 3 Gang Smart Switch is a top-notch product that delivers on its promises. The easy installation process, seamless app connectivity, and stylish design make it a standout choice for anyone looking to upgrade their home lighting system.

      "review_snippet": "The only thing you want a smart switch to do is at least to be as good as an old mechanical switch. You expect from a switch to consistently and instantly turn the light on and off as soon as you press it. This one doesn't.It's been working pretty much normally for a while, but in recent days it's only working sometimes. Sometimes I press the switch and it turns the light on or off, but sometimes it takes a few seconds or it just does nothing. It seems to depend on both the internet connection and the Smartlife services to be working fine. That is a stupid design flaw that speaks for the bad quality of the product. I don't want to lose the ability to switch lights on and off from the wall switch just because my internet connection isn't working well or if Smartlife's services aren't working well.Do not buy this product."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2022",
      "review_snippet": "I purchased the 2-gang switches to replace two light switches in my shed.  It was always a pain when I left the lights on in the shed and had to go out at night and turn them off.  I have most of my house under Alexa control, so this seemed like a good option.First off, be sure to label your existing wires.  Only at the end of the installation did I notice the nice labels included in the bottom of the box.  I could have used them since there were extra wires powering outlets in the switch electrical box, so I lost track of the light load wires.  I got it right the second time around.Setting up the Smart Life App was easy, however it only recognized one of the two switches at first.  I let the firmware update on the first one.  For the second switch, I tried turning off the breaker for 10 seconds, then pressed and held the switch for a few seconds to get it flashing, then it was recognized by the app, and I updated the firmware on that one also.I was a bit puzzled why Alexa would not recognize the added switches.  After several tries, I found I needed to “Link” Smart Life with Alexa, then everything worked great.  Hopefully this will help someone who also ran into problems getting Alexa to recognize the devices.The confusion about the red/green indicator is certainly understandable, but it doesn’t bother me since it’s in a shed.  I have a different brand Alexa switch that has a white indicator LED.  It turns on when the light is off so you can find the switch, then turns off when the light is on.However, it is exactly what I wanted, so I can’t complain at all.  If I have any problems in the future, I will add to this comment, but at this point I am very happy with the purchase."
