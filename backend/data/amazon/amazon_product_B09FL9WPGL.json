      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 1, 2025",
      "review_snippet": "I spent a lot of time researching LCD touchscreen styled switches and eventually took a chance on this one based on the appearance and a video review from someone in the UK.I have to say that I really like the overall functionality of these switches.  It has great touch response and so far after nearly a year of being installed, has had no issues with that aspect of it.  It's easy to wire and install and initial setup to get this thing running is fast as well.  I really like the interface lighting and customization.  I did try 2 other touch-screen style switches to compare later, and they've been disappointing compared to this one.My ONLY grip with this switch is the WiFi part.  It seems to lose it's functionality with WiFi and re-connecting sometimes requires a reboot of the switch.  The initial WiFi connection process is fast and easy, but once it drops, it's more of a challenge to reconnect.  And while being able to control my lights via an app can be appealing and appeases my sometimes laziness not to want to get off the couch, it was not my primary reason for the purchase.  Personally, the WiFi feature is more of an added bonus for me, so not functioning properly only dropped my review down 1 star.I can't speak to the customer service either since I rarely engage those anymore with anything... I think we've normalized poor customer service with just about everything these days, so can't base my rating on that either.Overall it's a great upgrade from standard toggle switches and can give your house a more modern look in my opinion."

The only issue was finding updated switch plates to place over the 2-gang and 3-gang boxes to mount the one l8 controllers. I'm pretty handy. altered box planks or the old wood plate covers.
