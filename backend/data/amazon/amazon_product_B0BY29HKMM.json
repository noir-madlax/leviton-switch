      "review_snippet": "These work perfectly for around my house. A great addition to renovating a house that was billed before this style of switches. It gives my whole house a more modern look well not breaking the bank. It's also very easy to install, but if you have an older house like I do. Your wires may be a higher gauge then the socket in which case dreading the wires through the back will be a bit of a pain in the butt. What I recommend is you pretread once every socket through one wire as to shave off the little bit of plastic that's preventing a smooth entry. It was safe you a lot of hassle of having to undo the whole thing if you're using the quick insert. If you're using the side hooks then it's just a standard procedure."
