A 4-way switch connects or disconnects two pairs of terminals. 4-way switch is needed if more than two switches control one light: two switches should be 3-way and all additional ones should be 4-way. Good switches test no continuity between terminals when disconnected and almost 0 ohms when connected. The 4-way switches looks like good quality upon physical examination. They test perfect functionally, as expected. Overall price is reasonable for two switches with cover plates."

I switched out our old light switches because they were very old and showing signs of wear and tare.  This was a simple job, pull wires off the old switch and place them in the exact same spot on the new switches.  It literally took me less than ten minutes to replace each light switch.  It helped that these were the exact same color as well.  The difference now is that the old ones had dirt and grime as well as being loose when turning the switch on and off.  The new switch very audibly  \"clicks\" and is very is also very crisp in its action of pushing the switch on and off.  These seem decent for the price they're asking.  I woke recommend."
