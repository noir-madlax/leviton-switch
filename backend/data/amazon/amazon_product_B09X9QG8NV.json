However, the functionality and build quality receive mixed reviews, with some saying it works well while others report it fails after about two months. Moreover, the dimming range and adjustment ability are problematic, with customers noting inadequate dimming and limited adjustability. Additionally, customers report issues with flickering lights and buzzing sounds, particularly at lower dimming levels.AI Generated from the text of customer reviews",

      "review_snippet": "These are my go-to dimmers. I have installed 4(I fried one, oops :0) I installed a dimmable LED flat panel and replaced the only old school dimmer I had with this one. The LED panel was able to get very dim on the old school dimmer, but not so low with this one even though I dialed down the trim pot. So I opened up the front plate and noticed the dim slide physically didn't go to it's lowest setting. So I had to grind n cut the slide to get the light to dim lower even more. However, you can now see an opening as pictured. Note, this does invalidate any warranties. Though I would like for it to dim even lower, I'm just leaving it as is. On the other lights, these work perfectly and zero hum or noise."

      "review_snippet": "Easy Install:  Insert wire and tighten screw.  No wire nuts needed.  Dimmer is similar to Leviton Sure Slide but less expensive.  Generally dimmer works very well.  The problem is LED lights, lights with drivers work better than without, limited dimming range with LED, doesn't dim as much as incandescent bulbs, lower dimming helped by lower wattage LED's."

It is holding up to general use.Dimming is nice and smooth, our previous one went from dim to bright, I thought it was the light fixture, but now I know it was the switch.I have basic knowledge on swapping out fixtures and this was self explanatory when you follow the guide it comes with.The only thing, I wish the on-off switch was on the top.Overall it was a good price for what you get."

      "review_snippet": "I am a builder/remodeler by trade: I work with and install electrical components on a near daily basis.I bought a set of 6 of these as a retrofit for the dimmer switches in my own home.My house is older and has rotary dimmers.Rotary dimmers don’t play well with dimmable LED lights as they will usually make the lights flicker and/or pulse.I wasn’t concerned about using a specific style of switch so I chose these switches due to the per-switch price point only.These switches are stated to be for LED lights so I figured they should be just fine for my need.Upon installing one I discovered that if I dim the lights, even slightly, the switch buzzes.The more I dimmed the light, the louder the buzz got.At their dimmest setting, the buzz could be heard around a corner and 20+ feet from the switches location.I removed that switch and tried another from the box.It did exactly the same thing.I also discovered that it still made the lights flicker while using the dimmer, which is the very reason I am replacing the old switches to begin with.The flicker wasn’t as bad as the old rotary switch, but still very bothersome & annoying none the less.I cannot recommend these switches in any way.I was able to return the switches for full refund."

First and foremost, the installation process was incredibly easy, thanks to the clear instructions provided. Even someone with minimal electrical knowledge, like me, was able to set it up without any issues.Once installed, the dimmer switch worked perfectly with my kitchen LED lights. There was no flickering whatsoever, which is often a concern when it comes to dimmable LED lights. The switch even features a small knob on the side that allows you to control the flickering, ensuring a smooth and consistent dimming experience.Considering the performance and ease of use, I wholeheartedly recommend the TOPGREENER Digital Dimmer Light Switch. It's a fantastic product, especially given its reasonable price. If you're in the market for a reliable and affordable dimmer switch for your LED or CFL lights, this is a worthwhile investment."
