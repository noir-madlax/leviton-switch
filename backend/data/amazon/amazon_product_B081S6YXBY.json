  "customers_say": "Customers find the illuminated light switch easy to install and appreciate its ability to help find switches in dark areas, with one customer noting it works well on dark staircases. The switch receives positive feedback for its appearance, with one mentioning it matches existing switch plates, and customers consider it practical and a nice addition to their homes. While some customers say it's worth the money, others find it not worth the cost. Moreover, the functionality and build quality receive mixed reviews, with some reporting it stops working after a few months and others noting it broke within two months of use. The brightness level also gets mixed feedback, with some appreciating the nighttime illumination while others find the nightlight isn't very bright.AI Generated from the text of customer reviews",

The switch can be installed with the LED up or down. Either way the switch is now opposite of the old one. Push on the LED side to turn light on. I went to the hardware store and got a length of three strand house wire which helped in the install this is the first of four. I connect both white wires together with a lever connector. I cut a length of ground wire and put one end hooked on the green screw. I then cut 2 length of black wire off my extra wire , about 4 in each. Cut off the insulation from both ends. Put one end in each of the holes so the back. The switch has two separate black wires coming out of the holes, tight the screws on the side to secure wires in the holes. All right then use a double lever wire connector and connect the existing black wire to my newly installed black wire for each side. You're wiring may differ or you may wish to consult a professional. Be sure and turn the breaker off until you're done wiring turn it back on test the switch without touching it just turn the breaker on and see if nothing shorts out turn to break her back off and install the switch in the box and the cover plate on the outside then go turn the breaker back on and you should be done. I would suggest using a square drive or Robeson screwdriver which has about a 1/4 in square on the end size s1. You look carefully at the screws on the switches and your existing switches and sometimes on the attachment screws holding the switch to the box those are not cross or Phillips screws some maybe even most of the screws on the switches themselves have a square in the middle and that square Drive screwdriver is what you need to get the screw tight. Overall good value for the money I bought the four pack I have three more switches to go and it should improve being able to walk around here in the dark, without tripping over the cat. Have a great day"

      "review_snippet": "We rearranged our bedroom and had no place for a night light.  I get up frequently at night to go to the bathroom and need a little something without waking up my husband.  I had no idea these even existed until I did a search on Amazon.  These are a little pricey, but BOY they are great!!!  It will only turn on when it is dark and turns off when its light in the room.  It is a lot brighter than we thought it would be, which worked out great for us. My husband installed this without any problems. When I turn the light on and off, it is a quality switch.  We got the pack of four, so now I'm trying to figure out which switches I want to replace."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2021",
      "review_snippet": "We purchased several of these and placed them in various places in the house and I am pleased with the purchase. They look good, are easy to install, make it easier to find the switch in the dark, and in smaller rooms, provide enough light where you can see in the dark (if your eyes have adjusted to the dark).They work best in bathrooms and small rooms that are dark or pitch black when the lights are turned off. In small rooms, if your eyes are adjusted to the dark already (like if you got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom), then these do provide enough light for you to see. But these can work anywhere if your goal is to make it easier to find the light. In large rooms or rooms with other light sources (such as night lights), these do not add much ambient light except directly above or below the switch.In the attached picture, you can see the relative brightness. The magenta night light in the bathroom is much brighter than the light from the illuminated switch, yet the illuminated switch still produces a noticeable amount of light. And this is with walls that are not white. You'd get better results if your walls were white.These switches are also ideal for situations where you have two switches next to each other. For example, in our house, the switch for the fan and the switch for the light are next to each other. We use the illuminated switches to make it easier to find the light switch. That way you or your guests don't accidentally turn on a noisy fan in the middle of the night. Or where one switch controls the porch light, and one controls the indoor light. We used the illuminated switch for the indoor light and kept the old unilluminated switch for the porch light. This makes it more obvious which light is which, especially for guests, if you tell them the switch with the light is the light switch.I mounted all of them face up. If you face the switch with the light facing up, it illuminates the wall and the ceiling above the switch, which gives enough ambient light that you should be able to safely navigate if your eyes are adjusted to the dark. If you have a white ceiling and a dark floor, it is better to mount it with the light facing up. More light will bounce around if you do that.Overall I am very pleased. I'll give it 5 stars for brightness, only because I expected this level of brightness. It is what I expected from 5 LEDs on top of a switch. If you expect it to be a night light, you'll be disappointed. But if your eyes are good at adjusting to the darkness, this actually does produce enough light to see in your bathroom and certainly is better than a pitch-black room where you can't find the switch."

If these returned switches were missed upon inspection the inspection is wholly useless.  If trying to 'hide' them basically criminal.  Used ones had individual blister packs re-taped with used wires still on just broken off.Now won't accept return unless all 4 returned along with an additional 'separate item' which has been now installed.  CHAT stated I must REMOVE the 2 installed new ones and send them back now USED.  CHAT was HORRIBLE - kept cutting me off, FORCIBLY ended Chat during me writing a response.  ONLY willing to refund HALF or purchase price."
