Let's say I had a really hard time putting it back together (it has a lot of pieces inside). After getting it together the front case wouldn't close unless held together. I got it hooked up and 1 switch controlled all 4 lights. So I tossed it.I bought another one and after googling I Come to realize it was obviously my fault, I was supposed to snip the side pieces to separate the 2 switches. Hooked it up and it worked. The rough switching was the same on the 2nd one too. Must be a design flaw"
