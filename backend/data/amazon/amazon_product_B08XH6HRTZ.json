    "SIMPLE SLIDER: Use the smooth sliding dimmer to create the right mood with your lights.",
    "ROCKER SWITCH: Easily turn the lights on or off with the rocker switch.",
    "PERFECT LIGHT LEVELS: Don’t worry about things getting too dark. You can adjust the minimum dimness with the trim wheel tucked under the rocker switch.",
    "IDEAL LOCATIONS: The Simple Dimmer works best in cozy spaces. Put it in your bathroom, office, or nursery.",
    "EASY INSTALLATION: Save on electrician costs—you can install the Simple Dimmer in seconds. Even without turning off the power, the Deako system protects you from electrocution.",
    "COMPATIBILITY: The Simple Dimmer works with dimmable bulbs, including 600W incandescent/halogen and 150W LED/ELV/MLV loads. It works best where one switch controls the lights (single pole circuits), but it can be used where multiple switches control the lights (multiway circuits) if all the other switches are Deako Simple Rocker Switches. The Deako Backplate where you set the Simple Dimmer up needs a neutral wire connection."

The functionality is positive, with one customer noting it works well in new construction homes. The dimming ability receives mixed feedback - while customers can adjust brightness, some report it doesn't dim all the way down. Moreover, the switchability and flickering lights aspects also get mixed reviews, with some customers reporting their lights flicker constantly. The value for money receives mixed opinions, with several customers finding it expensive.AI Generated from the text of customer reviews",

      "review_snippet": "Many homes in our area are being built with this type of electrical system. This switch, dimmers and outlets are the simplest to replace. It is literally plug and play. No locating and opening the breaker, no wiring to mess with. All is needed is to remove the faceplate, unclip the switch, pop it out, then replace with replacement. I replaced a light switch with a dimmer switch in less than a minute. Downside is, they're a little more expensive than the standard switches, are not available at your local hardware store yet and are not compatible with standard switches."
