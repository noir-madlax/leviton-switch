Our kitchen countertop outlets are grey so I wanted a matching colored switch.I like that this has a positive \"click\" when it's turned on/off and I used this as a single pole switch.In the picture this switch is on the right.  The switch on the left is a 20-amp switch for our garbage disposal."

I know give me the negative feedback for that one :-).  Youtube, about a dozen videos, gave me that idea.  Lastly, safety, please.  Be sure your breaker is off. I am just throwing that in.  I am disabled and my hands freeze up.  So you get the speil on safety and Wego.  Anyone can do it.Lastly, a freebie for Amazon add additional purchase, wireless volt detector.  Good job to Amazon for getting the product at the house on time.CheersElectricians Remarks Trump Any Comments Made."
