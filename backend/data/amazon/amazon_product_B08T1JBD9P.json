      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2025",
      "review_snippet": "So far 5 stars. I bought this one and another brand for a bathroom remodel. Both are going to control lights that can be dimmed. This brand worked well right out of the box. There's a main power on off switch at the bottom. Once it's on, you can leave it on and turn the lights on and off with the toggle. If you want to dim, turn the lights on, then hold the toggle down until the light starts to dim. Opposite, hold the toggle up until it's at the desired brightness. Easy enough! Plus there's a small dim warm-white light within the toggle so you can find the switch in the dark.The other brand I bought, the internal light was blue, and would constantly flash (I'm assuming because it wasn't connected to the internet yet). The controls worked pretty much the same, but more buggy, more delayed, and sometimes backwards. So I'm going to return it.I saw some reviews stating that the switches don't fit in a multi switch panel. To that, I'll say that my house was built in 1998, and these switches fit right in with no issues. They do provide a slight amount of wiggle room where you screw them into the wall, so make sure it all fits before you tighten everything down."

Purchased a variety of products from Govee, Tuya, Gosund, and others.  All join WiFi no problem, some program better than others, but this one while it works has a quirk that drives me nuts.  It appears when ever WiFi or the Internet is down they start flashing ON-OFF.  Like others reported no fun when your bedroom light starts flashing at 2AM.  I have 8 of these switches installed and have found if I reboot my Cable Modem router not all but most will start flickering, 5 seconds on 5 seconds off until WiFi/INET is restored.  I've been gone on business trips and neighbors report my front porch light or my kitchen light is seen flashing while I'm gone.  Tuya Smartlife app is great with this switch for building scenes and controlling them from a toggle switch but this flashing has to stop or I'm gonna find another vendor's product!  Subtle but one thing I do like about these Toggle switches is the back lighting makes them easy to see in the dark.....UPDATE:  I have nine of these switches installed in my home and some of them would flash continuously when the connection to the Internet was lost.  My service provider was doing firmware updates at night to my cable modem and my bedroom lights would start flashing continuously at 2AM for 15 minutes until the firmware update completed.  Totally frustrated I lashed out at the support team and they admitted this would happen when INET connectivity is lost but only on some switches which they considered a bad batch, not normal behavior.  They sent me 3 new switches I installed them and then tested the theory by disconnecting my cable modem.....sure enough the flashing stopped for my bedroom lights and pantry.  I walked around the house and found two more switches flashing upstairs so I asked them to send me two more and BOOM now they are behaving as everyone expects.  My problem was not a WiFi connectivity problem that the support team kept suggesting.  I increased my rating to 5 stars now that all the problems have been resolved."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2023",
      "review_snippet": "Every switch and plug in my home is a smart one and have been for years. Insteon was the best ubtil they went under and the hub failed, causing me to replace ALL of my wall switches at once. Given the expense of the mass replace, I tried the treatlife switches. I liked them, except for the fact they had a failure rate of about 50% after just a couple of weeks. I then went to Kasa/TP-Link - reliable, easy to install, but the dimmers only dim in about 5 increments and can be erratic. So, when I decided to replace my last non-smart wall dimmer switch (I had held off because it is a toggle switch and it shares a box and double wall plate with 2 other toggle switches, which are together, but one on top of the other, requiring a special wall plate So, not wanting to buy a hub for just one switch, I went with this one, apparently from SmartLife/Tuya. As my house is entirely \"smart\", I've gained extensive experience at the installation of all switches, plugs and devices. Plus, I have a 1.2 gig internet connection with unbelievable wifi. This new switch was to be installed within about 4 feet of my router. Of course, it required it's own SmartLife app. First problem/concern arose when I went to use the app to install it and the toggle dimmer was not listed in the app, only the paddle dimmer and they are vastly different, such as the paddle dimmer has a reset button, whiule the toggle dimmer doesn't. Anyway, got it wired easily enough, but then went to program it. First, the switch was almost impossible to get into pairing mode and would keep dropping out of pairing mode. The instructions then made some reference to using two cell phones and setting up a mobile hotspot between the two, etc. It aslo referred to having to perform a reset, using the non-existent reset button and getting the switch to flash blue, which it wouldn't- only orange. The written instructions do not match the app, the app deosn't match the switch, the whole thing is pure junk. All other swirtches have taken maybe 10 minutes to completely install, program and setup with Alexa. After 2 hours of complete failure, this piece of junk went into the trash, not even worth the time, effort or money to send it back. Have ordered a TreatLife paddle to replace it, hoping I get one of the 50% that don't fail and will be customizing my double faceplate to accommodate it. My advice, stay far away from this junk."
