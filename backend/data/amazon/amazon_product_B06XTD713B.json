The product is easy to use and simple to install, and customers appreciate its lifespan, with one mentioning it makes lights last twice as long. The build quality receives mixed feedback, with some finding it well-made while others express disappointment with quality control. Customers disagree on whether the switch turns off completely, and several find it bulky.AI Generated from the text of customer reviews",

It dims a strip of LEDs under the molding on my computer hutch.  It allows for cranking the light up to full brightness for reading things on the desk or dimming it to a pale night light.  It's the perfect control for what is effectively a backlight for my monitor -- the dimmer stops it from being glaring or blinding."

Connect it, turn the dial, and your device can go from off to barely on to full power.However -- I got it for an LED lamp that continuously cycles through a range of colors, and it turns out that in order to do that, the power has to be on max. I can have a red glow as dim as I want it, but the color change cycle won't start unless I turn up the power all the way. If I unplug it while on a different color, it comes on red again when I reconnect it, and stays that way unless I turn the power up. I realize this is my lamp's problem, not the dimmer, but since this is probably not an uncommon type of device to want to use this with, you should be warned it may not work for that."

Although they don’t dim them at all, they just turn them on…which is fine, that’s all i really cared about i guess but i would be more happy with it if it didn’t take rolling the switch all the way to the end to turn them on, which is not practical at night. Especially since i have to scroll it 3 times around. also doesn’t allow for the controller use and can only choose one color and one setting."
