      "review_snippet": "In the interest of full disclosure, Meross provided a free switch for me to test and review for them.  Their program does not require the review be in their favor, so I am free to post whatever I want.That said, I truly have no complaints with this device. It installed easily, as long as the installer isn’t afraid to work with electrical wiring, and setup was easy.Meross has been my smarthome brand of choice lately, due to their stuff just working really well, the simple and fast firmware updates, their great customer support, and how easy it is to work with their app.  So, when Meross reached out, asking me to test their new switch, I jumped on the offer.Frankly, aside from adding support for Apple HomeKit, this switch looks and feels exactly the same as their non-Apple enabled switch.  I was glad to see this.  Another brand I previously had been using, changed the look of their switches with each new model.  So I was happy to see that Meross maintained a consistent look.A new “screwless” switch plate was included in the box, but I was installing this into an existing two switch location.  While I was at it, I replaced the second switch (powering a ceiling fan) so that it matched, and used a double gang switch to separate the fan and lighting circuits.Like most smarthome switches on the market, this one does require a neutral wire.  While I didn’t have any neutral wires readily available in the junction box, I did have one passing through to an electrical outlet nearby.  So I just had to pull that neutral back from the outlet, and then add a new 3’ long wire to replace what I’d pulled out.  Added 5 minutes to the installation.As soon as I powered up the new Meross smart switch, it was ready for setup.  I opened the Meross app, clicked the “+” sign in the upper right, and selected the type of device I was installing.  It sent me to my WiFi config page so I could connect to the AdHoc wireless SSID from the switch.  As soon as I connected to the switch, I was prompted with a pop up informing me this switch was Apple HomeKit enabled and asking if I would like to add it to HomeKit as part of the process.  It then opened the Apple Home app for me and HomeKit setup was all of 60 seconds.  I then switched back to the Meross app and completed the setup in there.  As soon as I was finished, I got a notification from my Amazon Alexa app that it had already discovered the new switch and could now control it for me.  This was so much easier and wrinkle free than the previous manufacturer I used to use.I’ve included a couple photos showing the original switches, the inside of the junction box, where you can see the neutral passing through in the back right corner, and how it all looked once I was finished.  It’s a nice clean look.As for performance, it’s working flawlessly, and instantaneously, using Alexa, the Apple Home app, and the Meross app.  I’m really happy with this switch."

      "review_snippet": "I have been replacing my light switches with these Meross smart Wi-fi wall switches. I got a few to try them out and see how well they work as a replacement for my smart bulbs.  The smart bulbs (3 different brands, including the supposed expensive good brand) would keep loosing connection. They would be unresponsive more often than not.  I was getting so tired of Siri \"not hearing back from the device\" so I decided to make the switch to smart switches, and boy am I ever glad I did.  No more problems with loosing connection since I started using these!  Also, some really cool features are as follows:If you are replacing a 3-way switch setup, you only need to replace one of the switches if you use these smart switches. You can set up an automation to make it so that the lights switch off automatically after a set amount of time, or you can make it so that whole groups of lights come on if you switch on one etc. You can use this functionality to effectively make unrelated lights work kind of like they are part of a 3-way light switch. Maybe best of all is there is no longer a problem if somebody switches off the light switch (unlike the dumb smart bulbs that get completely screwed up if somebody accidentally forgets and turns off the switch). I also like how I can decide on a per-switch basis, if I want the little indicator light to work as a night light, a power indicator, or to just stay off (this functionality is accomplished via the Meross app, and that's about all I have used their app for so far, it's easy to add your switches to the Meross app if you have finished setting them up in homekit first). So far I have found these switches to be very reliable.  Setup can be done completely through homekit and it works pretty seamlessly. Out of 12 switches so far (both 3-way and single pole) I have only had one that had any hiccups while trying to set it up, and after resetting the device, setup went smoothly on the second try. Please note, these switches require the neutral wire, so they won't work if your house doesn't have neutral wires in the switch boxes.On a side note, I noticed that amazon \"clip to save\" coupons pop up every day or so with these, so don't buy them all at once.  Buy them one set per day so you can keep getting that coupon each time!"

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2025",
      "review_snippet": "One thing to note is that the switch doesn't \"flip\" per se, it just sort of \"clicks\" like a computer mouse to toggle the internal electronics/relay.  There is an LED on the switch to reveal power on/off vs the physical position of the switch.  Also, wiring is via screw nuts to the box wiring as opposed to more traditional terminals.  Installation is fairly straightforward provided you have the opposing switch wired correctly, and Homekit integration is seamless.  My only serious nitpick is that the faceplate pops off way too easily, sometimes accidentally if the box screw terminals are too deep, i.e. behind the plane of the wall.  A more secure snap-on mechanism or even a screw attachment of the faceplate would be a welcome addition in this case."
