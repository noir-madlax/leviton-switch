      "review_snippet": "My house was custom-built for me 13 years ago.  I finally decided to install a ceiling fan in a guest bedroom that is rather small.  The home builder made a small error in that his electrician installed a 3-gang wall switch electrical junction box in this bedroom instead of a 2-gang box.  One of the switches is the recessed ceiling lights, leaving the other two positions for the ceiling fan.  Now everybody knows that ceiling fan switches are all combination switches whereby one switch has controls for both the light and the fan.  This presents a cosmetic problem for the guest bedroom because had I used the combination wall switch, then the third position within the electrical box would either have to be a switch that does nothing, or a blank flat insert (I cannot explain that any better).  Over these past 13 years, I just had two switches there that did nothing.  But installing the ceiling fan would finally complete the room, so to solve the wall switch problem, I looked for a separate light dimmer switch and fan dimmer switch.  I found these by TOPGREENER.  I am uploading an identical review for the other switch.  I am very happy with both products.  Both were easy to install, work correctly, feel good to click through the various detents, and are visually appealing.  Recommend !"

As you can see in the video, it dims and lightens too quickly. It also does not dim enough before turning off. Don’t get me wrong, I do like it, but those aspects could be improved. Very easy to install for a beginner DIY’er."

In fact, it has increased the range of dimming for the halogen bulbs it is providing power for. Looking forward to seeing how it functions with LED light bulbs. Good purchase!!"
