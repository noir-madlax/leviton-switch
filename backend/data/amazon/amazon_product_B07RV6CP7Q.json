I went to local hardware store for a 20-amp decorator switch and was told they didn't believe such a switch was available in the paddle style.  Checked Amazon web site and sure enough there was exactly what I needed so I am very happy with my new switch."

      "review_snippet": "Apparently 2,75\" is the standard. My electrical box measured less than that so I couldn't install them. I suspect my plastic box got squeezed at the original installation. I'm doing a remove and replace of the switches, so a different box is not a convenient option. Not able to return these switches so I'm taking the loss. Have found and purchased others that will fit. Switches work and appear to be well made so I have no complaints."

Once we had all the power on, some switches would stay on and not toggle off, some wouldn't even toggle on. I had to pay and electrician to remove and reinstall ones purchased from Home Depot. They were a disappointment. However, I did catch them on the last day of the return time frame and was able to get the money back from purchasing. Now I am just out the money of having to pay and electrician twice."
