They don't work, and the company takes no responsibility. They simply do no work. Sometimes they go on but not off. Sometimes they go off but not on. Often they just turn off for now reason. They always say \"Not responding\" even when they do. I wish I could just stand on a building and announce to the world how bad these are. Customer support always says the same thing - try resetting.  I have now had them removed and paid an electrician a second time to install my new Kasa switches, which work wonderfully and I recommend highly.Buyer beware - these are pure unadulterated junk!!!========These are the worst Alexa switches I ever bought. They are difficult to program and then they constantly fail to respond. Slightest outage and you have to start all over.  Update after a few weeks they started blinking on and off all day. I tried to reset them but now they are completely off line. Pure garbage"
