  "customers_say": "Customers find the light switch works well and is easy to install, with good value for money and positive visual appeal. Moreover, they appreciate its functionality, with one customer noting it works perfectly as a replacement for unavailable 3-stack switches, and another mentioning it's particularly useful in bathrooms. However, the quality and switch functionality receive mixed reviews - while some find it solid, others report it breaking after a couple of weeks, and while the switches generally work well, one customer mentions issues with the middle switch not flipping properly. Additionally, customers disagree on the fit, with some saying it's perfect while others find it too large.AI Generated from the text of customer reviews",
