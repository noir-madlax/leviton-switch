      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2025",
      "review_snippet": "Update:  I use this with a strip of low voltage, dimmer-compatible, under-cabinet LED lights. The lights will occasionally, not frequently, blink (off-on) when controlled by this switch. This isn’t related to any other load kicking in or anything like that. I’ve only used this switch in the lower half of its range so don’t know if the problem would occur throughout the dimmer range. I missed the return/exchange cutoff date, so I am living with it, which isn’t hard as it doesn’t hamper the work that’s being illuminated. Could be a flaw in just this particular unit, and I still like the switch.Originally:  This is a nice, smoothly operating dimmer switch. I like the large rotary knob. I am using it with under cabinet LED light bars, and the switch seems to vary the light intensity over the entire range, 10-100% according to the light's manual, in a linear fashion. Funny thing, though—when I chose this unit I was happy to see from product photos that the neutral (wide) blade of the switch was on the right. This mean that for most electrical outlets, at least in the U.S., the switch would have to be plugged in upside down, with the receptacle for the device the switch was controlling pointing up. Some reviewers remarked that this was unfortunate, but for my application it was perfect. Now that I have the switch, I see that the manufacturer has reversed the plug orientation, probably in response to criticism, which probably will make 90 percent of customers happy. I opened the unit to see if the plug orientation could be easily reversed, but that does not seem to be the case. (I think that would be a cool feature to have. I now see that a diagram and a customer photo on the product page does show this wide-blade-on-the-left orientation, but as of this date the seller's product photos and videos still show the opposite.) So, I will be turning the receptacle in my outlet box over (for those who don't know, the electrical code does not specify that for households the orientation of receptacles has to be any specific way) so I can use this nice dimmer switch upside down, the way that will work better for me."

It was possible at the highest setting - if you were very careful - to get it to run - like a sweet spot on the dial.  But that was intermittent and any other position would not work.  It did power up a small table fan and worked fine for that.  My other comment - has no ground - only 2 prong - so if you have a 3 prong plug you will have to get a \"cheater\" plug.  My stove fan had 3 prongs - and even if it had worked I would have had some concerned about it."

The goal was to create some stylish back lighting without the hassle of wiring in traditional dimmer switches. That's where these dimmers came into play, and let me tell you, they were a game changer.I simply wired the lights behind the wall to a plug and connected them to this switch. The setup was a breeze – no complicated wiring, no permanent alterations, just straightforward, effective lighting control. It's the perfect blend of simplicity and functionality. For anyone looking to add a touch of adjustable lighting without the usual fuss, these dimmers are the way to go!"
