      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024",
      "review_snippet": "I recently installed the SOZULAMP Light Switch with LED Night Light in my home, and it has been a great addition. The built-in LED night light is a fantastic feature, especially in hallways and bathrooms where extra visibility at night is helpful. The automatic on/off sensor works well, adjusting the brightness depending on the ambient light in the room, which helps to save energy.The installation process was straightforward and comparable to a standard light switch, making it a good choice for anyone comfortable with basic electrical work. The switch itself has a nice modern design and feels durable. One thing to note is that the LED light is quite bright, which might be a bit too much for some people in a bedroom setting. However, it’s perfect for areas where you need a bit of guidance at night.Overall, I highly recommend the SOZULAMP Light Switch for anyone looking to add a convenient night light feature to their home without the need for separate plug-in night lights. It’s functional, energy-efficient, and looks great."
