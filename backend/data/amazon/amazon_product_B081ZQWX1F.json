      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2025",
      "review_snippet": "This double rocker is great. Its settings in the Aqara app allow you to “decouple” each switch individually from its particular circuit. For example, you can install it to replace a single switch and then program the decoupled side to run automations. Because it relies on a bridge it remains operational if your internet connection is down. Moreover, you retain the ability to automate your home without the need to sent your usage data to a server in another country. Its physical size is like any other smart or occupancy switch but it packs a whole lot more in that size since it also serves as a repeater for the signals from the bridge. Adding this switch to your home with an Aqara bridge will expand the coverage of your Aqara networks. Also I like the fact that it remembers its last state prior to an outage and it resumes ghat behavior as if it was never an outage. This is a major issue with a lot of home automation devices that require reprogramming after outages or simply just do what they want when the power flickers. I am beyond satisfied with the fit, finish and operation of this smart switch and will watch for sales to outfit the rest of my home."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2023",
      "review_snippet": "Well, this just might be my new \"go to\" no neutral on/off switch.  I have an older home with a couple switch boxes that are wired as \"switch legs\" with no neutral available in the box.  I have a \"switch leg\" switch at the top of my basement stairs that controls one lonely little bulb at the bottom of the steps.  The remainder of the lighting in the unfinished basement are old time pull chain bulbs in ceramic overhead fixtures that I have to manually turn on and off after I go down the basement - a pain to turn on in a nearly dark basement, and a pain to turn off especially if you go up the stairs and realize you left them on.My quest was to find a no neutral on/off switch that could be used to trigger an Alexa routine when the smart basement light switch is toggled on, which would in turn trigger \"smart\" bulbs located in the pull chain fixtures to turn on, eliminating the need to wire all the fixtures to a single switch.  An inverse routine would trigger the lights to turn off when the wired smart switch was turned off.Easier said than done - I have a ton of TP-Link devices in my home, but none of the Kasa switches offer a \"no neutral\" option, so they were out.  I also have Lutron's Caseta switches in my house - they only offer a no neutral dimmer switch, which is illogical on an overhead basement bare bulb light, and also can't be used to initiate an Alexa routine (they can only be acted on as a result of some other smart device action, they can't themselves initiate the action in an Alexa routine).  My next attempt was to try Leviton's no neutral on/off switch - a nice product, but again can't be used to initiate an Alexa routine,Enter the Aqara no-neutral on/off switch - add the switch to Amazon's Echo Premium 4th Gen, which has a built in Zigbee hub (no Aqara hub, skill, or account required, put the Aqara device in \"discovery mode\" and ask Alexa to discover new devices).  Next add your smart bulbs (in this case, Kasa branded) to the Kasa app, add the  Kasa skill to Alexa - Alexa will discover the bulbs.  At this point, you have all the ingredients to create a routine triggered by turning on the Aqara switch, which will turn on the \"dumb\" bulb that the switch is wired to, and add actions to the routine to turn on one (or more) of the smart bulbs installed in the pull chain fixtures (leave the fixtures turned on all the time, and hide the pull chain string from your family :-) ).Problem solved - now I am also looking at Aqara's door/window sensors for my exterior doors - the Zigbee hub in the Echo Premium 4th Gen opens up a lot of opportunities for Aqara's Zigbee based devices."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2024",
      "review_snippet": "Some switches in my 1960s house have no neutral and no ground (switch loop wiring). This switch works perfectly fine and I was able to add this to Alexa directly and didn’t need the aqare hub or app. I hope this helps anyone that is in the same situation. I did ground mine to metal electrical boxes even though I didn’t have a ground.---UPDATE---After using these switches for a couple days, I've realized if you pair these directly to the Echo Zigbee hub, the switch eventually flashes red meaning it lost connection. This red light flashes until its controlled via Alexa voice again and then it eventually times out and will flash red again.To fix this I tried ordering the M2 Hub which fixed the red light issues but also created another issue. If these are connected to the Aqara hub, Alexa doesn't recognize the devices in routines to use them as triggers. They do appear if it is not being used as a trigger. Unfortunately in my case I am using my switches as triggers to turn on other switches/plugs of other brands.It seems like these devices are locked down to keep you in their ecosystem. If you don't mind them blinking red when on, they still work perfectly fine paired directly to the Echo hubs via Zigbee.UPDATE 3———-I was able to figure out how to get this to work correctly the way I wanted. Do not connect directly to Alexa skill, setup your hub and add all your devices and then add the hub into Alexa by the matter code. This always everything to work correctly in routines!!When I linked to Alexa skill and everything was imported 1 by 1 it was causing errors when trying to make certain routines."

      "review_snippet": "I needed a no neutral smart switch for use with home assistant and this is the best I have found. It works reliably and was easy to connect using my home assistant zigbee dongle. I currently have them on every switch in my house where they make sense. For places where it only replaces one light switch I use the second button to trigger automations."

      "review_snippet": "I used this as a smart switch for my pool lights. The wiring for the pool switch did not have a neutral wire, so this was necessary . And since I already had an Aqara hub, it worked wonderfully! Very happy."
