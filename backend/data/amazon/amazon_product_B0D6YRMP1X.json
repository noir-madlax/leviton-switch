The app was simple and I've integrated them with alexa. 3rd party alexa compatible devices are actually better than Amazon Alexa devices for household members. I'm amazed Amazon alexa devices can only be set up on one userers Alexa app, how short sighted is that! When 3rd party Alexa compatible devices with their own app can be easily integrated into unlimited number of alexa users. So using these 3rd party alexa compatible switches both me and my wife can access these switches through our own alexa apps. It drives me nuts that my wife can't control our Amazon thermostats from her phone for either of our homes because they are setup on my Alexa app. Had I known this first I would have bought 3rd party thermostats, and probably will replace them for this reason."
