They appreciate its smart appearance, adjustable dial, and consider it good value for money. The dimming ability and build quality receive mixed reviews - while some say it does a nice job and is sturdy, others report it barely dims and note cheap plastic construction.

The three-way wire is tagged, so you know which one to cap off if necessary (cap provided).  I was a little confused with the wiring of the house, and the fact that one wires was loose and came completely out before I could even remove the old switch didn't help matters.I would have appreciated longer screws to screw into the gang box, but it is what it is.  Anyway, I appreciate the adjustment wheel, which took a short while to figure out and get the settings just right, but I managed to find that sweet spot.  On the lowest (dimmest) setting, the lights will go out if I turn on the garbage disposal, but only for a brief moment; about the same length of time as a slow blink.  LEDs need a minimum amount of voltage to function and every device and appliance in your house draws more energy when it first kicks on than what it uses while operating.  Even as I write this review, the air conditioner kicked in and caused the lights to blink (keep in mind, they are at the lowest setting possible).This switch is certainly doing what I was hoping it would do and it wasn't overly difficult to install.  Price was pretty good, too.  I would recommend it."

      "date": "Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2022",
      "review_snippet": "This dimmer works great on a single pole switch for my dining room fixture that has 5 60W (equivalent) LED bulbs. I've seen reviews saying this dimmer doesn't work with LED bulbs. First, make sure you have dimmable LED bulbs as not all LED bulbs are dimmable. If they don't specifically say they are dimmable, they will not dim. Second, you must do the the thing the instructions tell you to do with the trim dial for sensitivity adjustment. This tells the dimmer what the lowest setting is and is absolutely necessary with LED lights. When my dimmer was first installed, the person who installed it didn't do the adjustment thing and the dimmer wouldn't work but then I read the instructions and watched some of the videos, and realized what was wrong. Without the adjustment, the dial is telling the dimmer that the lowest setting is full brightness. I did the adjustment and - viola! - working dimmer. Very happy with this dimmer!"
