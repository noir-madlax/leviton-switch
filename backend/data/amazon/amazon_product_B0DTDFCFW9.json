      "review_snippet": "These are nothing fancy - but that's not a bad thing. They're solidly made and not flimsy, and have a good \"click\" as they switch.There are both screws and push-in connections on the back. Some cheaper switches are missing one or the other, so it's a nice thing that these have both.They use standard screws and decora plates, and so far everything fits well."
