This has a tech look to it and has five rectangular LED segments at the top that emit white light. I imagine you could put the lights aiming downwards if you prefer with a single pole action would be opposite. It would be great if they made a three-way switch as well. But the photocell on the switch, we can see the little hole for it works well. It is so useful in trying to find a light switch in the dark. Seems to be on average quality with any other switch you can buy in a big box Store. Not spec grade however, good for residential.",

I didn’t have to “hunt” for the light switch when I wanted to turn on the light and, plus, it was a great nightlight for going to the bathroom in the middle of the night. I really expected it to last a lot longer than this, especially with it being electric and not battery operated. Very disappointing!",

I liked this product because i believed it would help at night but not keep the LED lights on all day like some other models (bathroom light switches for instance). My only complaint is that i wish the light sensor was a little better. I sometimes find it on around 3pm when there is enough light in the room. My expectation was that it would only turn on at little (5pm-6pm) to no light. The LED lights are not as bright as advertised but, still good. Actually prefer it because when i get up to use the bathroom at night, the light is not as bright, as say a iphone flash light.",

        "text": "Our bathroom switches are about a foot down the wall from the door, so we always fumbled to find the switch. Now with this illuminated switch, we can easily find it in the dark. The LEDs aren’t too bright at night (which is a plus), but they’re visible enough to find in the dark. My only issue was getting the LED to fire downward. So I removed the switch from the metal surround and flipped it. Not thrilled about it, since all the wires are on the same side now, but it works the way I want it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",
