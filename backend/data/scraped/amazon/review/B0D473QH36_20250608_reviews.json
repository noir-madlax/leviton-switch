Work great, you can adjust how low you want the dimmer to go and so far no problems with flicking which I had with most of the other dimmers I purchased on Amazon or from the box stores. Can't beat the price either and I like the hour glass shape of the switch as it distinguishes the dimmer switch from the other switches on a multi gang location.",

It is great to find these dimmers that work with old wiring and are able to control dimmable LEDs as well. Besides the slider on the switch to control the brightness, there is also an adjuster to control the adjustment range so you can set it to work properly with your fixture and bulbs. I'm only using the single pole control but the switches can also be used as 3 way switches as well.",

I've noticed a small amount of flickering with these switches, but it is improved from the previous switches so I'll call that a win. I probably just need to get some better bulbs! These switches have a nice rocker movement that is easy to turn on/off. The switch slider is easy to use and everything seems durably made so should last a long time. I really like that these switches have a screw so the dimming can be adjusted for the brightness range. I have these mounted in a 3 switch box and the color of the plastic doesn't quite match the other switch or the 3 switch wall plate. The match isn't real far off, but the plastic on these looks slightly cheaper than the other switch and wall plate. I don't think it is anything you will ever notice if this switch is mounted on its own with the included wall plates, I just wasn't able to do that so thought it should be mentioned.",

One replaced a dimmer switch that caused the lights to flicker, the second adding dimming capability to a string that had an on/off switch. In bothe cases they were not 3-way and they worked well. I really like the slider that allows you to turn the light on to a preset light level. The paddle shape is a little unusual but not unattractive, and I was able to break off the side tab and mount the switch in a box next to a GFCI outlet, so the footprint is fine. Hard to find any fault with these switches. Highly recommended.",
