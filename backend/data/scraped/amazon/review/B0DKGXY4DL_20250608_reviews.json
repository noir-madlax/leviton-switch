        "text": "Installation was quite straightforward - as long as you can identify the load, line, neutral, and ground wires, you’re good to go. Take a moment to study your existing 3-way switch setup, especially the common and traveler wires, since this switch follows a similar wiring pattern. I’m not an electrician by any means; my only prior experience is replacing a few standard switches with smart ones. Despite my initial hesitation - especially after seeing it marked as a “Frequently returned item”- I went ahead, and honestly, I’m glad I did. It turned out to be easier than expected. As for the smart connection, thanks to Matter support, I didn’t have to rely solely on the Tapo app. I first added the switch using Matter via Apple Home, which automatically synced with the Tapo app, and then integrated it with Alexa through Tapo. Now I can control the switch from Apple Home, Tapo, and Alexa - a really convenient setup.",

Although the item was unfortunately lost in the mail (Amazon couldn’t cancel my order due to the Vin program), I’m still confident this product would be an excellent addition to my smart home setup. The features like full dimming control, energy monitoring, and Matter compatibility with Alexa, Siri, Google Home, and SmartThings align perfectly with the high-quality performance I’ve come to expect from TPLink products. I love the idea of controlling my lights remotely, setting schedules, and tracking energy usage—all things that matter to me as someone who values both tech and eco-conscious living. Looking forward to getting a replacement to try it out!",

It was a little hard to get all the wires in the box since I had a large GFCI and another smart switch in that box, but it all fit. Setup took a few times to work, but once it was setup, I've not had any issues. It's great to be able to dim from two locations with separate buttons on the switch instead of holding it down like many other switches require. Overall this is a good product at a reasonable price.",

Some people like this, some people find it confusing. This is a Matter device which means you need a Matter compatible hub such as a Google Home or a newer Amazon Echo (or any other Matter compatible hub). After powering on the switch, a pop-up message appeared on my phone and walked me through adding it to my Google Home hub. After that I could control it from the Google Home App or by voice. It also added to my HomeSeer system so I could then control it from there or add automations. Note that this kit is designed to be used in a 3-way circuit. If you wanted to just use it at one location, it would not work. I tried this and the dimmer blinked red, which indicated that it was not connected properly. It needs to be connected to the included accessory dimmer that they include. So, keep this in mind when you install it. There are separate buttons for bright and dim.",

One is in my test rig that I use for testing luminaires and stuff. You know - how bright is it, what is its dimming range, does it flicker, etc. The other is to test out home assistant integration. No joy there yet, but I haven't tried too hard either. By home assistant integration I mean using the switch with a local controller and no phoning home to tp-link.

They are the only brand I've seen do that, which speaks volumes. That said, coming from kasa, you used to be able to just buy 3 way kits and mindlessly use them as single switches, effectively getting 2 independent switches in a 3 way kit if you only had a need for single pole. Seems those days are gone, as the directions do talk about being able to wire this for single pole, but I could NOT get it to work. I ended up buying another tapo single pole kit which worked great, and just to make sure these weren't defective, actually installed it on a 3 way with traveller wires, where it worked out just fine. Again, INCREDIBLE support for product lifecycle from these guys. Leviton, Legrand, and Belkin could learn a LOT from TPLink. I'm super loyal to them for not forcing their earliest customers like me to live in two different ecosystems.",

        "text": "These make for nice lights wishes, and my first dive into the Tapo series from TP-Link. I have used plenty of Kasa series products and have come to like them due to the reliability versus some of these no name brands that tend to fall off the network over time forcing you to have to reset power to them. When it comes to this model, you do have to take caution to make sure that the right switch is installed at the right place since these are master versus slave scenario versus install it anywhere like some of the options out there. That was really my only complaint, though. If you can call it a complaint. As long as you know what you're doing when you're installing them, you'll be fine. Okay, I lied. Now that I think about it, I also don't like that I can't add these to home assistant without some difficult yaml additions vs a simple integration. However, I can't flaw these for that directly as it is still a new series and the company probably just hasn't rolled out a stable API yet that would allow for such an integration. Unless they don't plan to do that, then this is indeed a complaint and would lower it by another star. I find it to be quite important to allow for integration with larger hub environments such as home assistant. Without that, products are doomed as everything is starting to push toward that thanks to things like Matter. But, oh wait, these are Matter compatible! Well that's nice, however, it's still limits what you can control or keep track of if there isn't a direct API relationship. Like energy monitoring, which for the Kasa series, requires the API integration in home assistant since you can't monitor energy via just a matter relation to the hub.",

I initially had them switched and the dimmer was blinking at me indicating a wiring issues. This requirement isn't detailed very well in the instructions. Matter controls are limited to on/off/dimmer. Using the Tapo app you can setup things like if the led is on at nights, on/off transitions, and other items.

        "text": "I have a large number of Kasa switches and plugs in my home, controlled primarily by Home Assistant. When I got the opportunity to pick this up I decided to see what the difference is with Tapo versus Kasa. First off - though I believe this is because it's a dimming switch, not Tapo versus Kasa - this switch must be installed as a pair. My existing 3-way Kasa non-dimming switches only need to replace one end of the run with a smart switch, and even when you buy those as a kit, the two switches are identical. This is not the case with this dimming Tapo switch - there is a main switch that needs to go where your always-on live wire is, and a satellite switch that replaces the other end. Typically the load will be at the far end of the circuit but that's not always the case and they do include instructions on how to wire things up if your circuit is unusual. In my case, I have a typical scenario with line in one box, where the main switch gets installed, and load in the other box, where the satellite switch gets installed. The satellite switch does not require (or even have) a neutral connection, so you can at least save yourself the work of digging the neutral out of the back of that box. Since this is my first Tapo device, I had to download the Tapo app. TP-Link does allow the Tapo app to control both Tapo and Kasa devices natively, which is a nice perk for mixed-device homes. Here's where the main upgrade from Kasa is - the Tapo switch does its initial configuration over Bluetooth, instead of a temporary wireless network. While the temporary wifi option does work, it's always a pain to deal with since modern phones try to reject wifi networks without internet access. Configuration over Bluetooth eliminates that conflict. The Bluetooth signal is quite strong, as well - I was able to set up the app from my desk a couple of rooms away from the main switch. Adding the switch to the app was completely smooth, and the app guides you through all the steps, including calibrating the dimmer. In my case, once that was done, I also had to add it to my Home Assistant setup, which was equally simple. There's where the other nice perk over Kasa shows up - the Tapo devices do power monitoring, which most Kasa devices do not. I will fully admit I was taking a bit of a gamble on this being a dimmer, since the previous owner of my house installed the can lights and I had no idea beforehand if they supported a dimmer. To my pleasant surprise, they work perfectly. Overall, zero complaints. I've been very happy with TP-Link's smart home products so far and I see no reason why this would change with the Tapo line as well.",

        "text": "This is my new favorite home automation switches...I'm using these Tapo's and some TP Link Kasa switches with my home automation system. For those that have this question: The Kasa is their \"premier\" line and the Tapo is their \"mainstream\" line of in-wall switches outlets, and plugs. Each product line has other products like cameras and such but I think the Tapo line is my new go-to for swapping out wall switches that I need WiFi control of from now on! This 3-way switch kit was a breeze to install! It works with just about every kind of light (LED, Incandescent, CFL) and will dim the dimmable ones too! One of my favorite features is that it will walk you through setting the dim and 100% levels with the Tapo app! It makes it so easy to find \"the bottom\" and ensure the dimmest setting isn't just \"off\" or flickering bulbs! The buttons are instinctual in their operation and they fit the decor and style of other \"deco-style\" switches in your home! The best part I think is that if the light is \"off\" you get a dim circle icon on the switch so you can find it in the dark! The dimming controls are above the paddle-type switch and are clearly marked with icons to allow you to dim or brighten the room! They are very \"expensive\" looking, to me they have an iconic look! They also have blue LEDs that indicate the level of the light which goes dark after adjustments...even those \"fade-out\"! I also love that if you have the Kasa switches, the Tapo switches, you can manage them all in the Tapo phone app, it of course integrates into all the other smart-home platforms (Alexa, Google, Home Assistant) and some models of Kasa and Tapo integrate into Apple HomeKit as well (my Kasa switches do). Even if you're not a \"Home Automation Nerd\" like me, you can buy, install, and then use JUST the Tapo app on your phone to schedule turn-on and turn-off times to automate your lights...it also has a feature to randomize the times in case you leave on vacation...no additional hardware/software or expertise is required! They have made it as easy as you need and as powerful as you wanted! Top-pick Tapo!",

        "text": "We love all of the TAPO products, and have quite the system with 9 cameras, countless switches and smart outlets. I love how these smart switches also keep track of energy used, which is something very few others out there do. The step-down when you turn the switches off is a really nice touch and makes it feel much higher end. I would prefer just a little more \"click\" on the switch when it's pressed, but it does still give a fair amount of feedback. Hooking nearly all TAPO products up to your network is completely painless and adds to the experience of using their products. You really can't lose with their stuff, and they've got the name behind them so you know the company won't disappear like so many other no-name smart switches and plugs.",
