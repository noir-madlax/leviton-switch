        "text": "The installation process was surprisingly simple, and the instructions were clear—definitely a plus. However, I experienced unexplained LED flickering issues that made the light unreliable for daily use. Since this seems like a design flaw rather than a one-off defect, I ended up returning it for a refund. Hopefully, the manufacturer addresses this in future versions, because the setup itself was hassle-free. Pros: ✔ Easy to install ✔ Straightforward instructions Cons: ❌ Persistent flickering issues ❌ Had to return for refund Verdict: Works well in theory, but the flickering makes it hard to recommend.",

The dimming feature is smooth and responsive, letting me adjust the brightness exactly how I want. The switch itself feels well-built and sturdy, not cheap or flimsy like some other smart switches. It works without a separate hub, which is a huge plus, and the installation was simple if you’re comfortable with basic wiring. Just make sure you have a neutral wire, since it won’t work without one. Overall, this is a solid smart dimmer at a great price. It’s perfect if you want hands-free lighting control without spending a fortune. Would definitely buy again!",

The downside is the likes to turn off the lights at any given time (I do not have a schedule set up). If you turn the lights back on at the switch, it turns back off. The same if you ask Alexa to turn lights back on, it will say not responding. You will have to wait a few mins and then you can turn the lights back on to where they will stay on. This only happens about three or four times a week so far.",

Now the problem: This switch is listed as LED compatible, but the switch leaks power (i.e. 'ghost' power), so even when the switch is supposed to be 'off', there is a slight voltage being passed through. Not a problem with incandescents, but with low wattage LED bulbs, they still glow even when 'off'. I'm trying to find another solution, but it seems manufacturers don't know/care about the issue in any specs I've seen online.",

I bought a regular Amazon Basics switch (non-dimmable) and that one works fine. Typically I would say they make returning the product or exchanging easy. For some reason it's not easy with this one.

These worked out great, and as a bonus for us, they can be operated via our Amazon Echo in the kitchen . . . hands-free! (In addition to the manual method.) The brightness/dimness can also be controlled using Alexa, which is extremely handy when working at the counter.",

        "text": "We really loved this switch, as it worked perfectly with Alexa and followed commands very well. The problem we experienced with this switch was out light brightness changing on it's own... Weird, I know, but our light would go dim, and then brighten up, sometimes going dim and then staying dim. It seemed to become worse as time went on. Sadly, we returned the switch, tried another, same problem. I purchased a much more expensive switch from Home Depot and it's been dead-on perfect. No issues. This is the very first time we have experienced any issue with an Amazon Basic product and I'm sure they worked out the issue. Our was built in the 1950's and our light does have LED bulbs, so that may have been the issue.",

        "text": "I have installed four of these switches and they are great. Note that this takes up a lot more space in your light switch wall box than standard switches. The width and depth are considerable. Some boxes may not accommodate, I had to replace mine to ensure a good fit and space for wires behind it. Once installed, the switch works great. Minus one star though, I did have a moment of mild panic once, where the switch stopped responding, not sure why, but maybe network issues... but it would not turn the light on or off. It seemed to clear itself up after a while. Seems to me that the switch should perform its normal on/off function regardless of network status or anything else, but that may not be the case.",
