Which is a big change from previous brand. -the click is nice -easy to install -I like that switch has a small circle light that lights when off so you can see them in the dark. -easy to use with Siri/homekit -price -when turning them off you have a setting that you can have it dim until off instead of just on to off. Which gives you time to fully exit the room. Cons: -none so far",

However, as I switch a room over to LED bulbs (GU10, MR16 type), each time I have encountered noticeable flickering until the bulb is driven to approx. 60%, so their effective dimmable range is not great in my experience. I have tried multiple bulb vendors with no success yet - despite all claiming to be dimmable. Just be aware that the dimming on these switches is known as Triac Phase Forward (aka Leading Edge) so be sure that you know what bulbs support that dimming approach.",

I had wired another brand of smart switches throughout my entire house that were maybe 15% cheaper but I could also find them at Home Depot. The switches I installed were not compatible with my local network and home automation software. They also dropped network connection everyday, the app was cheap and barely worked, and the dimming stuttered. So I bought these Kasa switches and other 3-Way switches, and just finished installing all of them. It is anmight and day difference. Kasa app is extremely easy to use, the options for customization are amazing, the operation of the dimmer is so smooth it's easy on the eyes. Better yet, they are all working with a third party home automation program I was hoping to use. If you are in the market and hoping to add Kasa products to your home just buy these. Save yourself the hassle of buying, installing, uninstalling, and returning cheaper alternatives.",

You do need the neutral so make sure you have it. Outside that, setup is less than 3 minutes a switch including install. You can set groups, schedules, last mode, long and double press options. I try to keep all my smart functions in one platform to avoid overlapping rules. So set the light up in the kasa app. Then schedule in the alexa app. The hardest part is coming up with a good naming convention but we have some weird single lights that we now make function from one switch or command when we want",

A couple of months ago, the WeMo dimmers simply stopped working correctly. No matter what I tried to reset them and reconfigure them, they refused to work. So I decided to give these Kasa dimmers a try since they were so highly rated here. Wow! These things are fantastic! The software set up is far superior. It is designed better. It looks really good. And the software does what it is supposed to. It works and it works well. The dimmers work excellently and I have zero complaints. Much more than I can say for the Wemo dimmers. I also bought a few of the Kasa smart plugs. They were a breeze to set up and work flawlessly. Going forward,, I will only be buying this Kasa brand. I highly recommend them. You will not be disappointed. By the way, these dimmers and smart plugs cost much less than the competition with no sacrifice in quality at all.",
