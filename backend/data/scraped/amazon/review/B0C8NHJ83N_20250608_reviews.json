It’s simple but would not recommend doing it unless you have some electrician’s experience. The unit makes very slight buzz in the mid dimming range. It can be fixed by adding some spacers over the inductor. Still, I would not recommend doing it unless you are an electronics pro. Assembly is fairly simple. My conclusion is that the dimmer is pretty decent.",

Obviously no one at the company is paying attention. The quality of the switch itself seem very good. I would purchase again if I needed.",

It was a simple process to install, you only need wire cutters, wire strippers and a small Phillips head screwdriver. Directions are simple to follow. I’m a DIY’er so it took me about 10 minutes start to finish to install one. if you are using this with an LED bulb it must be the type that is dimmable (it will say “dimmable” on the box and on the base of the bulb). This is truly a variable dimmer from full Off to full on.",
