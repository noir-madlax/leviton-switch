Got concerned about this so ordered a switch from a different company and hired an electrician to come out.

Looks like I need to file a warranty claim for this thing now. Really annoying as I had to hire an electrician to confirm what I already suspected. I have used Leviton switches before and they worked fine, but it’s very frustrating to get a bad one.",

It works fine, but I feel like a chump for paying the full price for it. Feels unethical to charge this much for a simple light switch. Also, as others stated, the switch action is a bit stiff and loud. I didn't think it would matter to me until I put it in the wall and have to actually concentrate when flipping the switch, to apply extra pressure to make it 'pop'. Strange that it's so stiff. And again, if I hadn't spent the same amount of $$ on it as a nice meal in a restaurant, I wouldn't be so picky :)",

        "text": "The switch delivered from Amazon was of surprisingly poor quality. I have installed well over 1,000 Leviton switches over the years. Depending on the grade of switch, they have all installed and performed as expected. The switch that was delivered had two terminal bolts that were installed at an angle, and when partially backed out showed stripping of the threads. The switch casing was also slightly skewed, making it hard to fit into a standard plate. As I needed to get the job done, I took terminal bolts from another switch and, with considerable effort, got them to seat in the internal square nuts. A bit of careful trimming with a utility knife got the faceplate on. I hope this doesn’t reflect a decrease in quality of Leviton’s switches. Despite becoming lighter and a bit more flimsy over the years, they have remained reliable.",

I succeeded after a little effort and saw the threads were stripped in the nut. After ten minutes of faffing about, I managed to screw it down well enough that I'd get a good connection that would hold, but if it's unscrewed, the screw will pop out of the nut.",

All my other (two and three way) switches in the house are Leviton and have been impresive. However, this four way switch was significantly more expensive and is a dud.

A huge call out I noticed was that these switches have much more resistance when pressing on or off. For example, the single pole switches have a nice feel when you turn on and off. This requires you to press the toggle harder in either direction. I bought 3 of them and this is consistent on all 3. Just something to know because I thought it would be easier to toggle than it is.",
