        "text": "I recently embarked on a large home renovation project and decided to install smart switches for all my lights, ordering 20 TreatLife switches, along with multiple 2-gang and 3-gang wall plates. Unfortunately, this decision turned into the biggest headache of the project. During installation, my electricians discovered that the TreatLife smart 3-way switches didn’t work with the other TreatLife 3-way switches and would need to be paired with non-smart switches. The lights would randomly go to the dimmest setting. Worse, I had no choice in which side the smart switch went on due to existing wiring, leading to awkward placements where smart switches were alone, and non-smart switches were grouped with others—resulting in a messy, unattractive look (see images). I contacted TreatLife, and while each response took a day or more, they finally confirmed that their 3-way smart switches only work with 3-way non-smart switches, WHICH THEY DON’T EVEN MAKE! Not very smart for a ‘smart’ switch company. They offered no solution for the mismatched look, and to top it off, refused to accept returns on the unopened switches that would not work with their other switches as it had been over 30 days. I ultimately found a solution with Lutron Caseta switches, which allow two matching switches on either side of the 3-way configuration through an innovative remote that can be installed to look just like the hard-wired switch while allowing way more flexibility with installation locations since no wiring is needed for the remote side. The result? A seamless, functional setup I love. While it required an additional investment and another electrician visit, the new system is worth every penny. If you want matching switches for your 3-way lights, STAY AWAY FROM TREATLIFE!",

Then another started being eratic just like how the first one had started and then completely failed. I have tried everything like reseting the switch to add it again but it would not even do that, even tried rewiring but to no avail. looks like they all have a short life of 1.5 to 3 years max because now as of today all #4 switches have failed and I cannot even use them manually to turn on/off the lights, I have to use the manual switch on the other end of the #3way to control the lights. I gave Three star because they are good when they work but don't expect them to last long and you would have to replace them every 2 to 3 years.",

        "text": "I have 5 of these around my house on 3 way light circuits. I really like them because they are easy to install, respond well to Alexa and are simple to use both manually and via wifi. However, they do not last very long. A regular 3 way switch will last for decades without any problem. I have had to replace 3 of these in 3 years. Two were covered under the warranty; the latest one is one year out of warranty and Treatlife will not replace it. It appears on Alexa ask the Treatlife app as being offline, the indicator light is no longer lit and it will not turn the light off or on manually. Treatlife customer service provided some troubleshooting suggestions but that's all. They will not stand behind their product because it's 1 year out of warranty. Of course, we're not talking about a lot of money but when you're dealing with an electrical device you've got to consider other implications of a failure. Will it simply stop working, as this and the others did, or is there something else wrong that could cause a fire or other damage if it isn't noticed in time. These are \"FCC certified,\" I suppose because they transmit a Wifi signal, but there is no indication of a UL Listing . I will look for better alternatives.",

This purchase was to replace the ones that died, so until I have a chance to see how long they last, I am sticking with 3-stars. If I was judging the Single Pole switch, I would rate them 5 stars as those have worked exactly as expected and have been working for over 4 year with an Alexa interface. *** UPDATE *** When the company read my review, they did offer to replace the switches that went bad, again, I like the look and feel of these switches, so I am hoping to have a better experience with the new ones.",

        "text": "Update on November 2024 Also, how many time I have to reset ALL of the switches every time after the power blinking or power outage??? it makes everything such a 3rd world. I purchased bunches in 2021 for a new contraction house. A few were defectives but they wouldn’t listen to me at first when I called their customer service, I had put my electrician on the phone speaking with them and then finally they agreed to send me replacement. After that, everything was fine for the first 2 years. The function of the switches started get crazy since last year, some switches turn on automatically after power outages or blinking and they can’t be turned off by APP, I have to reset them every single time. If we’re out of town the lights are all on till we get home to reset everything. It gets worse this year, some of them just turn on repeatedly right after I turn them off, I couldn’t turn them off so I had reset those switches and delete them from my APP, when I trying to reset them they were all dead, so I had to replace them from my stock that I purchased 3 years ago, then found out that they were discolored, unless I change the whole panel of switches otherwise the color doesn’t much here and there. So these switches life spans are about 3 years. the switch itself is not expansive but it definitely is expansive for only last 3 years.",

        "text": "Didnt know that a company like Treatlife would sell used smart switches . Two out four had wires which are cut, one didn not work at all, the fourth one was not smooth to press and there was dust along all the 4 switches clearly showing it was a used product and no quality check was done. AVOID this. I got an electrician come over to install the switches for which he said he will charge $60 per switch. He installed the first two and when it was time to turn it on it, only 1 worked but required to press hard. So we thought maybe we thought 1 switch was faulty and design of other had problems. So i thought to use the third one and then i saw the cut wires for both of them!! My electrician replaced back the original switches but would still charge me $120. Now even thought TreatLife would accept the return, i paid 2.5 times the cost of this switch without getting any benefit ☹️☹️☹️ And yeah, there was no manual!!!! So just avoid it at all cost. I dont know if i can ever buy a Treatlife product",

The switch buzzes while off and then turns on by itself. Not a fan of wasting electricity when it’s pricey already. Don’t need these switches to keep buzzing and then coming back on, on their own.",

Installed one on a 3- way circuit (2 switching locations) and one on a 4- way circuit (3 switching locations). The switches worked mechanically, toggled the light on and off manually, and also toggled through the app. However, the app would not show the lights were on, which means if you are remote, you don't know whether they are on or not, and Alexa cannot turn them off since it thinks they are always off. Customer service was useless in helping. Suggested uninstalling and reinstalling from the app, changing light bulbs and switching traveler wires, none of which worked. On my own, I moved the switches from the line side to the load side, and that didn't help. Final say from customer service was \"the switches are incompatible with your 3-way circuit\", which is crap, all 3- way circuits have the same wiring. Ended up replacing the switches with dimmers, which worked just fine. So, their 2-way and 3-way dimmers and 2-way switches work great, but the 3- way switches don't work.",

When a solve was not apparent, they quickly shipped replacements free of charge. I will definitely continue to recommend TreatLife products, and I’m sure we’ll be a longtime customer.",

        "text": "I like the TreatLife line of products, but have had trouble with there three way switches providing proper ON-OFF indication in the app for circuits with longer wiring runs. They always indicate they are off. This makes it impossible to set up automation to turn the lights off or give commands via Alexa, Google,etc. TreatLife doesn’t publish specs on max wiring length. However, I have seen post in home automation threads where works run into the same problem. TreatLife tech support has also confirmed that wire length could prevent issues. TP-Link 3 way switches have the same issue. I had to go with Leviton for my 3 way circuits which requires every switch in the circuit to be changed out and gets pricey. I stil prefer to use TreatLife for all my single pole applications do to the significant cost savings and the products are good.",

Issue is there comes a time where they no longer accept your pressing the switch to turn ON. You first notice you press to turn ON and 5-seconds later the lights turn OFF. Next, it takes a long press (3-seconds) for the switch to accept the input to turn ON (and you must do the same to turn OFF). Another tell tale sign is asking Alexa to turn ON or OFF, and 5-seconds later the switch performs the opposite. I've replaced these with the KASA brand switch which from my experience have been very dependable.",

You can use this switch either as a standard single pole or a three-way circuit. It's nice that you can put one at the end of the circuit and use a standard 3-way switch on the other end of the circuit. You do not need to be an electrician to install these, the instructions are easy to follow. They're constantly improving the app at the suggestion of their customer needs. Between the App and Alexa, you can achieve any programming you need. A++",

        "text": "I spent $850 over the course of a year changing all my switches to Treatlife products to manager dozens of recessed can lights, bathroom fans, ceiling fans, etc. With so many switches and kids, I thought it would be great to be able to dim the massive amount of can lights and also control them to keep lights all over the house from being left on. The theory is great but the switches are not. I have fought several to keep them on the network constantly resetting them. Several have been replaced. Several are not working now and I had to put the old toggle switches back into one fixture. I have a mesh network so signal is never a problem. Every time we have a power outage of any sort, many get messed up and have to be reconnected to the network / app. The newest versions I bought as replacements are even harder to get online since they “automated” the process. I have 2 that cannot be synced and are brand new. 3 out of the 4 fan light combination switches have failed. Naturally some that I have the most trouble with are in the basement and I have to go down to turn off one switch out of 3 that my kids left on even after using the app to turn off ALL basement lights. I contacted Treatlife about some of these issues and they wanted me to go thru all the programming steps and tell them what happens at each step. I explained it is not even turning on so I cannot make it do anything. Then they said I must have made a mistake wiring them. I am an engineer and have wired several houses and barns including fixing others mistakes. This is all run around to avoid warranty claims. They won’t stand behind the high failure rate products. My advice is to limit your installations to only devices that benefit from connectivity and avoid the headache and expense of such a buggy system. Definitely not worth the hype for a whole home install. And definitely not worth a wife being upset the lights or ceiling fan is not working.",

I spoke with the company and they say that all their smart 3 way switch must have only one smart switch as a master switch. The second switch must be mechanical/regular!
