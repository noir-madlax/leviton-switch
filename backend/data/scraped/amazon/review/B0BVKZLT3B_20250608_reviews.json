I have returned items because they wouldn't pair. I saw a YouTube video about installing wifi switches and the guy said he had no pairing problems with Leviton wifi switches at 2.4GHz. He was right. I installed it and in less than five minutes it was paired and working. To reduce a lot of frustration I highly recommend the Leviton wifi switches.",

        "text": "First, Leviton is high quality, no question. This is not my first automatic Leviton switch, this was a second buy. This switch comes with a nice screwless wall plate, which you can use if you have a lone switch to replace. It easily connects with your wifi system using your phone and the MyLeviton app, where you can set up schedules for on and off times, including basing them on sundown or sunrise. For instance, I set mine to come on ten minutes after sunset and go off at 10:30pm, every day. Now, installation: Is this for a DIYer or for an electrician to install? If you know nothing about house wiring, don't plan on doing this yourself. Nothing wrong with how it's built, but you can run into interesting issues when you open a box with, say, three or four other switches in it. It may seem to have a confusing jumble of wires, the switch you're replacing may have no neutral (white) coming to it, and you'll need to figure out which wire goes to the source and which goes to the load. All that said, if you DO know what you're doing with house wiring, this is a snap to install (aside from the problems just mentioned). The switch is likely larger than the one you're replacing, and there may be scant room for it. The switch has wires coming out of it (i.e., no screw terminals or insert holes) that you attach to existing wiring with wire nuts, and you need to cram all that in the box. Note that this switch can be used in two-way or three-way configurations. Full disclosure, I have used it only in two-way on/off applications.",

Ordered a third we will see how long it lasts. My home is a smart home and I have no issues with any products. Easy to.install in an uncrowded switchbox.The app works well. I do not like that they added advertisements to the app which is annoying. I recommend the product. The app use to be good till thr greed took over.",

Only SLIGHT issue is, if you lose power and they turn back on before your WiFi is back up, they may get a little confused. But still 1000 times more stable than any other smart switch brand I’ve tried. Install is easy. If you’re living off grid like I am, they draw very low vampire power.",
