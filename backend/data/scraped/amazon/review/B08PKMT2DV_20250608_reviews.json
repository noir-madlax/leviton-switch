        "text": "Was setting up hue lights for client's kitchen, I have like 30+ hue lights at home so I have a bridge. The clients don't really care about the bridge they just wanted good lights so I was trying to pair the lights with the remote only. I got this v2 one because it specifically said it will work. At first try I couldn't get it to work because I was using the app to pair it. On the instruction it actually has the section showing how to pair without bridge and you just pair it by placing the remote close to the lightstrip or bulb and hold the button it will pair and work. Love it.",

        "text": "Was very easy to set up and install. The wall mount has the option to screw it into the wall but I opted to just use the 3M adhesive that comes on the back of the wall mount. I put it on the wall just above the actual light switches. The remote sticks to the mount via magnets. The magnets are the perfect strength, they hold the remote firmly in place but yet it is easy to pop the remote off the wall to keep on a nightstand etc. Setup in the app was easy and you can really customize what you want each button to do. My only complaint is that when I first walk into the room I have to hit the buttons a few times before they work. I’m guessing this is because the remote is in some kind of standby mode when not in use? I’m hooked up to a bridge on 1 gig high speed business internet at the house so I don’t think it’s a connectivity issue on my end. Despite this minor flaw I’m very happy I purchased this remote so I don’t have to fumble around with my phone every time I walk into a room. Will probably get hue bulbs + one of these switches in every room eventually",

The problem is; you have to look at it and aim for the button at the top - in a dark room... My wife and I keep knocking it off the wall, because we're used to just having a simple switch... I mostly just want to turn on or off the light; rarely do I need to dim it, or change \"scenes\", and when I do - it can be done in the app. A better design, would be a large ON/OFF toggle with a very small dim slider or knob off to the side. Basically, this design puts features before usability. I won't buy any more until they address this.",

Once done, the remote works every time. If you have a smart bulb in a lamp or something, it's essential to have a manual control. If I need to turn a lamp on in the bedroom at night, I don't want to use a voice assistant or fumble with an app. You can configure the press and hold to turn off all lights in the house. I would prefer if this could be configured to turn off all lights in the room.",

I think the switch might be fine and it's just the completely useless Hue app that is the problem, as I do see the switch's blinking lights turn green.... but ultimately this is a complete waste of time and money. The fact that the app says \"Need help? Visit philips-hue.com/support\" and the site sends you to some completely pointless random marketing site about how wonderful Philips is, while offering absolutely 0 support, speaks volumes :( Ultimately, this switch is useless trash. I'll look elsewhere, and I'll migrate away from the Philips Hue system if this is what passes as quality product from them now after their strong initial offerings in home automation.",

Only problem was the room doesn't have a light switch for the ceiling wiring. This worked out perfectly. I screwed one Phillips Hue bulb, held the power button on the switch a few seconds until the bulb blinked to pair. Then repeated the process for a second hue bulb. Now the room has a on/off switch and the bulbs even dim. I didn't have to download any app or any of that non sense. Very happy that I didn't have to get a electrician to break my walls to run a wire for me.",
