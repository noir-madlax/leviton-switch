It's no different, except to say that the live wire must be on the primary switch. That out of the way, the switch itself is neat. The rocker switch part is not a rocker switch, it's a simple pressure switch. There's no up for on, down for off. Touch it anywhere and it turns on and off. The dimmer switch controls the dimness (of course) and the two switches do sync with each other. All-in-all it's a good switch. It is expensive, probably because there is no competition. Someone else needs to make one.",

Only one of these is the actual switch. The other is a \"remote\" switch that cannot work on its own. Not only that, they look nearly identical and endless you know to look for the -R product number you could end up debugging a switch that isn't meant to be used as a switch. Lutron's own help pages just assume you know this. The install manual assumes you know this. None of this is obvious. I hate Lutron's install manuals. They don't even show proper wiring diagrams half the time. Yuck.",

        "text": "So first off, watch the video online to install because the paper instructions did not specify how to wire three way correctly, only the video. We had existing three-way regular flip switches. But each light had the red and black wire reversed from each other. In the instructions, it tells you to basically wire them up the exact same as we found it. And the pictures look like everything is opposite from each other. We did everything it said, and it didn't work. Then we went and looked on the video online, and it said to make sure that whatever is attached to the blue screw is exact same on both the master and companion switch. Recommended red. Which one of ours was on red and one of ours was on Black from the start. So once we did that it started to work, but our companion switch would not work, only the master. It would dim on/off when the button was held down and if you let go of the switch, it would go back to whatever state the master switch had it in immediately, After scouring the Internet, we found advice that finally worked! Unfortunately, the website troubleshooting did not have this answer so I'm here to share it with you. If this happens the master control is programmed to work with a mechanical switch. Go to to the master control and hold the tap switch, and up on the dimming rocker at the same time until an LED starts to blink, then release. If the bottom LED is blinking, tap the up button on the dimming rocker once so the blinking led is in the middle. Once the middle LED is blinking, tap the tap switch once to get out of programming mode. This worked for us, and had we not found it on a forum we would not have been able to use these switches and would've returned them. I think the company should update their troubleshooting guide to reflect this issue as it seemed to be really common. The only other thing I wish was that it would remember the setting that you had it on last and it would turn on to the setting you had it on last but I guess that's not a huge deal since we have it set for a kitchen light. We have the switches paired to compatible LED wafer lights. The brand is Mico and the model is 5cct in 1 slim panel Led recessed downlights. In their manual, they mentioned that this Luton was a compatible dimmer switch and highly recommended. We didn't want to risk buying cheap switches that wouldn't last long so we went with the high recommendation spent the extra money.",

        "text": "We did our last house with Lutron Dimmers. 18 dimmers, about 1/2 were faulty, all were replaced with simpler Leviton dimmers which worked fine. Now we find ourselves in the same situation. Another rennovation, chose Lutron for looks, so far we've replaced 2 switches, I have another 2 to replace today (with simpler Leviton dimmers) and I believe there's another 2 that are acting weird. Problem: They have a delay when lighting, anywhere from a couple of seconds to 5 or 6 seconds. Frequently they never trigger the light, very occasionally, they work. Off works fine. At the first house, a different Lutron electronic dimmer had about a 50% failure rate. We were told, by Lutron, a bad manufacturing batch. However, the dimmer had a short market life and was discontinued before we purchased ours. A large inventory of junk was left in retail channels. We unknowingly bought the junk. But HD did refund our money. Now we have at least 25% failure rate and nowhere to go but worse. The first 2 replacements were covered by the wholesale electric supply house our electrician uses. My converting over to Leviton is not covered. My advice: Buy from a retail channel with a good return policy, insist your electrician do the same. Test quickly and thoroughly. Insist he gets them working before you pay. Do not take \"its the LED light\" as an excuse/reason. That's pure and simple BS, pull the switch, touch the wires, viola, the LED light works fine. These are pretty but they are also poor quality.",

        "text": "I recently installed these Lutron dimmer switches, and I'm quite pleased with the results overall. The standout feature for me was the easy-to-follow diagram that supports 4-way circuits and made the installation process a breeze even for a beginner like myself. For reference, I bought the companion dimmer switch along with this in order to have the switch at a 3rd location. That being said, while the dimmer switches themselves function well, they are snappy to turn on the lights and dim. However I couldn't help but notice that they feel a bit cheap and squishy to the touch. Given their importance in daily use, a more substantial and tactile feel would have been preferable. Despite this minor setback, their performance at this price point in adjusting the lighting to create the perfect ambiance for different situations gets the job done. If you're willing to overlook the somewhat flimsy feel in favor of their excellent functionality and ease of installation, these Lutron dimmer switches are a practical addition to any home lighting setup.",

        "text": "The Maestro dimmer system is great for lighting. The dual pack includes the main control (with lights) and a companion dimmer (no lights). for a 3-way installation. Easy to wire with back push in ports. Side screw terminals are also available. If replacing plain on/off 3 way switches be sure to note the wiring and traveler wires. These are great in many different rooms of your home. Dimming saves energy and also adds more interest to a room. it is an easy DIY project. For intermittent use in a home. I have had these for several years without any problems. Works well with LED lights and older incandescent bulbs. Not meant for tubular fluorescent bulbs. I have never had any issue with the Meastro switches, installing or function. You have to properly identify the traveler wire to get it to work properly, if you don't you will have issues. Also use the breakaway metal tabs if using the dimmer in a box with other switches so it does not touch the other ones.",

        "text": "After trying and failing to install two different wifi three way dimmers I decided to eliminate the \"smart\" aspect and install a three way dimmer. This was one of the few that offered the ability to dim the light from both switches, which is a necessity for me. Installation was easy if you already know how to wire a switch, and it worked as expected. I'd give it five stars if the main button to turn the lights on and off wasn't so chintzy. It feels like thin plastic and there's almost no resistance when you push it, so if you're walking by and hit it you often have to stop and push it again. This is the same on both switches. More often than not, we now slap the button with authority rather than tapping the button, which I'm sure will reduce the lifespan of the switches.",

Threw the power to the room... Tested the switches... And was over the MOON. Since they worked, I started shoving stuff into the wall and the main switch itself POPPED! Lights turned off and the switch smelled like burning electric. Turns out these guys do like being played with, fluctuations in power Will kill them, so i highly reccomend killing power when doing anytning with these... And deffinitly use the power kill tabs to even do something like a light bulb change",

I bought these common Sylvania LEDs at either lowes or HD and although they don't list them on Lustron's compatibility list, these switches do control them quite well! No flickering or \"always on dim\" smooth gradients between lighting levels. I am happy.",

You can see in the pic that one of the lights is off. Its like this at least 50% of the time now, if not more. Installed it less than 6 months ago, so definitely not happy with purchase.
