I have many problems after installing these switches with a professional electrician, I installed these switches throughout my house and they turned on and off normally, but when I wanted to do dimmer in the living room, they dimmed all the lights in the house. I contacted the seller's customer service and they did not give me any solution since the products have a big factory problem. I already solved the problem by buying other switches from another brand but the TREATLIFE ones are going to the trash so the time to return them has passed, stay away from this product, look for something different from this brand, this was my experience and I would not want anyone else to have this problem. Ojo, no les recomiendo que compren estos interruptores, son de muy mala calidad. Yo tengo muchos problemas después de instalar estos interruptores con un electricista profesional, instale estos interruptores en toda mi casa y se encendían y apagaban normalmente, pero cuando quise hacer dimmer en la sala, atenuaron todas las luces de la casa. Me comuniqué con el servicio al cliente del vendedor y no me dieron ninguna solución ya que los productos tienen un gran problema de fábrica. Ya solucioné el problema comprando otros interruptores de otra marca pero los de TREATLIFE se van a la basura así que ya pasó el tiempo de devolverlos, aléjense de este producto, busquen algo diferente de esta marca, esta fue mi experiencia y no quisiera que nadie más tenga este problema.",

        "text": "One of my pandemic projects was to replace my dumb light switches with all smart ones. I choose Treatlife as my switch of choice and installed more than 20 of them around my house. There were a couple of duds during the initial installation, but otherwise things went smoothly and we have loved having smart switches that work with Alexa. There were periods where we could go months with making physical contact with a light switch. The problems started about 2 years after installation. Since then one-by-one the switches have been dying. I am now (4 yrs later) at the point where every single one of the switches have failed. I do not know if this is the expected life expancy of smart switches or if this limited to Treatlife, but you should know going in that if you install these you will be revisiting that effort every 2 to 4 years.",

        "text": "I recently embarked on a large home renovation project and decided to install smart switches for all my lights, ordering 20 TreatLife switches, along with multiple 2-gang and 3-gang wall plates. Unfortunately, this decision turned into the biggest headache of the project. During installation, my electricians discovered that the TreatLife smart 3-way switches didn’t work with the other TreatLife 3-way switches and would need to be paired with non-smart switches. The lights would randomly go to the dimmest setting. Worse, I had no choice in which side the smart switch went on due to existing wiring, leading to awkward placements where smart switches were alone, and non-smart switches were grouped with others—resulting in a messy, unattractive look (see images). I contacted TreatLife, and while each response took a day or more, they finally confirmed that their 3-way smart switches only work with 3-way non-smart switches, WHICH THEY DON’T EVEN MAKE! Not very smart for a ‘smart’ switch company. They offered no solution for the mismatched look, and to top it off, refused to accept returns on the unopened switches that would not work with their other switches as it had been over 30 days. I ultimately found a solution with Lutron Caseta switches, which allow two matching switches on either side of the 3-way configuration through an innovative remote that can be installed to look just like the hard-wired switch while allowing way more flexibility with installation locations since no wiring is needed for the remote side. The result? A seamless, functional setup I love. While it required an additional investment and another electrician visit, the new system is worth every penny. If you want matching switches for your 3-way lights, STAY AWAY FROM TREATLIFE!",

Troubleshooting revealed burned-out ESP8266 boards that became very hot when powered. The unit with the failed relay became hot to the touch, which raised safety concerns for me. Unfortunately, these issues occurred outside of the support period. Based on my experience, the durability could be improved, so I recommend considering this when making your purchase.",

A few were defectives but they wouldn’t listen to me at first when I called their customer service, I had put my electrician on the phone speaking with them and then finally they agreed to send me replacement. After that, everything was fine for the first 2 years. The function of the switches started get crazy since last year, some switches turn on automatically after power outages or blinking and they can’t be turned off by APP, I have to reset them every single time. If we’re out of town the lights are all on till we get home to reset everything. It gets worse this year, some of them just turn on repeatedly right after I turn them off, I couldn’t turn them off so I had reset those switches and delete them from my APP, when I trying to reset them they were all dead, so I had to replace them from my stock that I purchased 3 years ago, then found out that they were discolored, unless I change the whole panel of switches otherwise the color doesn’t much here and there. So these switches life spans are about 3 years. the switch itself is not expansive but it definitely is expansive for only last 3 years.",

And if you have to call an electrician to fix 3 way switch, that's even worse. I threw in the towel and started replacing with old school dumb switches.",

        "text": "I spent $850 over the course of a year changing all my switches to Treatlife products to manager dozens of recessed can lights, bathroom fans, ceiling fans, etc. With so many switches and kids, I thought it would be great to be able to dim the massive amount of can lights and also control them to keep lights all over the house from being left on. The theory is great but the switches are not. I have fought several to keep them on the network constantly resetting them. Several have been replaced. Several are not working now and I had to put the old toggle switches back into one fixture. I have a mesh network so signal is never a problem. Every time we have a power outage of any sort, many get messed up and have to be reconnected to the network / app. The newest versions I bought as replacements are even harder to get online since they “automated” the process. I have 2 that cannot be synced and are brand new. 3 out of the 4 fan light combination switches have failed. Naturally some that I have the most trouble with are in the basement and I have to go down to turn off one switch out of 3 that my kids left on even after using the app to turn off ALL basement lights. I contacted Treatlife about some of these issues and they wanted me to go thru all the programming steps and tell them what happens at each step. I explained it is not even turning on so I cannot make it do anything. Then they said I must have made a mistake wiring them. I am an engineer and have wired several houses and barns including fixing others mistakes. This is all run around to avoid warranty claims. They won’t stand behind the high failure rate products. My advice is to limit your installations to only devices that benefit from connectivity and avoid the headache and expense of such a buggy system. Definitely not worth the hype for a whole home install. And definitely not worth a wife being upset the lights or ceiling fan is not working.",

So far, 2 have failed, not reacting to Alexa voice commands, then being unable to pair with a router again located less than 20' from the switch. The switch does function manually, so the internal WiFi is kaput. I would not recommend this particular brand as your WiFi dimmer solution.",

Currently trying to get a replacement from the manufacturer however am being told they will not replace as it was bought through Amazon? I'm sure we'll get it straightened out.

I had probably made my purchase for these light switches a year before they were actually installed, and before I was able to move back into my house. The install was very easy, after creating an account on the Treatlife app. One of my light switches however, failed to go into pairing mode, for me to connect it to the app, or Alexa. I contacted customer support, through the Amazon help page, and explained that my light switch was not going into pairing mode. It was very quick and easy to get a customer service representative on the phone. He walked me through some troubleshooting steps, and concluded that the light switch was faulty. He took some information from me, and a replacement switch arrived within a day or two. The new switch was installed, and paired seamlessly. I have 6 of the dimmer smart switches on the recessed lights throughout my house... I love them. They were easy to set up, and connect to the Treatlife app... easy for me to enable voice control through both Alexa and Google. I just walk in and out of rooms, and have my lights controlled through voice activation. Love this option when walking into a dark room, or when my hands are full. You can even control for the lights to be set to turn on/off on a schedule. Thanks for much for excellent quality control. You made my experience a pleasure choosing your brand... and thank you for standing behind your product. I would highly recommend this brand of dimmer smart switch because of the convenience of voice activation, the ease of set up, the ease of using the app, and most importantly the ease of customer service, in the event you have questions or concern about your product.",

I've never had to touch base with Customer Service for anything, but when I finally did, they gave me a ticket number for a defective unit then never responded for over a month (as of 03/07/23). I've reached out multiple times in this month and have not received a response. I cannot back a product where there is no service to help. UPDATE 04/2023 Customer service ended up reaching out to me after posting this review to rectify the situation and sent me a replacement switch. I gave them 4 stars as they did replace the faulty switch, but left out a star for how long it took to get the right people and get my issue resolved.",

        "text": "I purchased the four pack about 26 months ago. One of them no longer turns on. I contacted the company and they gave me a simple troubleshooting technique. It didn't work. When they wrote back to me a couple days later, they simply said that they stand by their 24 month warranty (something for which I have no evidence) but my purchase has passed that warranty time period. Now remember - this is a switch that turns on a light and dims it. You would expect a switch to last significantly longer than 24 months. In fact, I've never had any light switch in my house break. Ever. Again...I have no idea if they honor their warranty or not. But ask yourself this. After either paying an electrician to install this or going through the fun of installing it yourself, do you want to be in that same position in a couple of years? Even if it's within 24 months and they standby their warranty when their product stops working, the major expense (either in time or money) is in the work being done to replace it, not the item. I've written glowing reviews for a number of items on Amazon and poor reviews for a few not so good ones. I try to be fair. This item doesn't deserve a good review.",

Tried removing the switch and reconnecting with same results. It is like they share a brain no matter what you do. I have not installed the other as I do not need all four following the same routine. I should have stuck with Kasa brand. Other than that I like the switches. I was sent an email by the seller advising me to follow the instructions for installation. I did follow the instructions and wired entire houses without any complications and it passed electrical inspections for occupancy. The ability and following the instructions does not change the fact of how these switches perform.",

When you pull the app up after you’ve installed several devices, click on Kitchen pendant lights for example, it will randomly turn on another switch. The app consistently has done this for the last 10 months for the first 30 seconds or so you have the app open. Basically you have to leave the app open for 30 seconds in order to turn on your devices properly through it Out of the 75 devices I’ve bought I have had 6 which were bad hardware, not horrible and I can deal with less that 10% defective however the app is horrible. The devices also have issues when you try to adjust the timer/scheduling settings. If you’re only buying three or four of these it’s not a big deal but if you have a large home and plan on installing them all over the house do yourself a favor and do not buy these.",

The only way I've had success is completely removing it from power for days and then reinstalling . The actual switch will still function as a manual switch they just drop wifi . I have a brand new mesh wifi system with one of the satellites mounted in the garage 3 ' above the switches so it's not a signal issue or a quality of signal issue . One of the switches has functioned perfect until tonight and it did the same as the other two just dropped wifi for no apparent reason after an hour of attempting to reconnect it with no success. I typically don't even write reviews but these things are infuriating.",

I only had it installed it 30 days after it arrived by a professional, so there was no going back :( Pro: -Works great with Alexa -Has a great App of its own -Love their other products (ie: \"The Smart Dimmer Plug- 9 months of use zero problems\" Con: -The lights flicker, anything below 100% and it will randomly flick up to 100% constantly. -So I've still been using it for about 5 months, Its a roll of a dice, every time I dim the lights below 99%, 10% for me seems to flicker only after some time, where as anything between 11-99% flickers immediately. The switch covers are smaller than hole in the wall, (Seriously Treatlife! Who is designing these?) To conclude: -1 Star cause, I wouldn't recommend it the slightest bit! -You think you getting a good 4 for 1 deal, you hope! You see 5 stars reviews and their leading you on. Stop! Look elsewhere! Treatlife can do better, just not this! -You need to spend a little more money, for one good switch.",

However, it did not power on with it connected. I used my multimeter to verify that I had the correct live wire connected to their hot red. After switching with the Line wire, it worked fine. This means the external labels or internally it was switched. Very sad since they went through a lot of trouble and good labeling to have it be incorrect. For that reason, it cannot be considered good, and I suspect with such poor-quality control it may not last, but we will see.",

        "text": "I installed 20+ of these in my brand new house. Lights would flicker and effect other switches in the house. You would turn on a switch and it would turn on another light in another room. Swapped out for higher-end WiFi switches and the flickering stopped. Also, some switches would show up on WiFi system. Seemed like cheap manufacturing.",
