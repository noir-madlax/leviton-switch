Philips has a dimmer stuck with magnets to the mount. Easy to work with. The button config. Weird. The working bits, rocker switches I guess, are crammed together. There’s more space to work with that would allow for better operation. I had to reset the device after removing the battery tape. Was NOT in setup mode so had to remove mounting plates to reset. Mounting plates. They do not end up flush with the wall. Design did not allow for tape thickness so it floats away from the wall it is mounted to. More bad design. ONLY works with cync app. No compatibility with Apple Home that can see.",

        "text": "I had a power outage and my generator cord went bad with an open neutral that caused a 165 VAC voltage surge on one side of the breaker panel. Every one of the Cync switches (9 switches) on that side of the breaker panel was taken out. I can see them failing with a lightning strike, but not 165 VAC. I'm very ticked off that all the switches failed. With an average cost of $25 each, that's $225 that I'm out. Not only that, but a few spare Cync switches I had could not be programmed with the app while my internet was out. My LAN wireless internet was working, but the switches could not be programmed without Internet access. The problem is that these switches can't be connected to a hub like Home Assistant. At this point instead of wasting more money for low quality Cync products, I'm will get different switches compatible with Home Assistant to eliminate the problems I'm having now. I'm going to tell people to stay away from Cync products. From my experience, they are pure junk.",

I tried two other \"smart\" switches before this one, first from Tapo, then from Kasa, and they simply didn't work at all. No amount of troubleshooting and following tech support's instructions would make them pair properly. But this one from GE? Flawless! Immediate and easy connectivity right out of the box. No hassle. Sure, it cost three times as much as those various TP-Link sub-branded ones, but they don't work at all, and this one does. So I'm pretty happy with it.",

Sucks because now I have un install four switches and through them away. got it going. But it’s not easy. About thirty minutes on the wires. The app was hard. You have to download the app to make it work with Alexa. I was hoping like the Gr smart plugs it would just work. Signing on the app was a pain. First it kept jumping out of the create accounts page. So it took a long time plus a couple of restarts. Finals did. And they demand an email. Then you have to put it in twice and verify it with a number. They really really want that email. Man. Because lord knows if someone hacks your account they could turn your lights on and off. Ooooo. Oh no. Not that. Then you have to get it to find the switch. Took about four times Now you have to get alexia to talk to their app. They have a button that says. Connect to alexia. Takes a long time to find it. Just fyi I have installed about 100 alexa plugs and switch since 2018. Now it still won’t work. You will have to activate the skill. So games and skills. Search. Now you can put it in groups. So my entire afternoon to get ONE switch hooked up. It does work. I need about twenty switches for my house. I’m looking for switches that worked with alexia with out an app like the ge plugs. I guess I will keep looking. Last the reviews on the Alexa skills are brutal. One star one star one star. People say it just stopped working. I had this happen with Lexington in my last home. They wanted me to update my password. Pissed me off. Like I have time for that. Besides that. The quality of the ge plugs and switches have been substantial. So far.",

        "text": "TL;DR: excellent product. They have thought of everything. Easy to set up and link with Google Home. Long version: I had bought a WiFi switch from a different manufacturer before this one. It was very frustrating as the app for the switch would insist I pick a 2.4GHz SSID even though I had (but my phone connects on the same SSID on 5GHz.). So before I ordered this one, I decided to talk to GE Customer Support. After talking to them for this product I decided to buy and try it out. And I was ready to do some tricks for the WiFi set up if the app had problems like the other manufacturers product which I will not name here. Anyhow long story short this switch was a breeze to set up. I did not have to do anything special with the WiFi setup. I entered the SSID and the password while my phone was connected to the same SSID on 5GHz. It worked first time. In a couple of minutes I was controlling it with Google Home and had a schedule set up. One of the things I was worrying about was the fact that this switch is a dimmer as well. But the special LED bulbs I have are not dimmable , so I was worried it may cause an issue. But during the set up process the app asked me what type of bulb it was and whether it was dimmable! So my worries were for nothing, they had thought about this detail and app knows to drive the switch so that it only has On/Off and not brightness etc. Product is very appealing and feels really high quality. My only issues was the depth of the switch. It took some work to get it to fit in the box in the wall with all the wires and wire nuts there as well. Packaging detail: I noticed that the box case for the product has a magnetic flap. I thought was kind of neat but excessive. Could have saved some cost there.",

        "text": "I have 48 of these formerly-C-by-GE/now-called-Cync wired switches of varying on/off, on/off/dim, on/off/dim/motion. Do not use the 3 wire variety. The aggravation and unreliability is not worth it. The four wire with a neutral required is the way to go off you're going to elect to use this line of smart switches. Seriously consider another brand, however. Here's what I don't like about them. 1.) You can't tell by simply looking at the switch whether or not the light is on in the room that it controls light if that's behind a closed door, like say, your garage. 2.) When you press the switch manually it often does not turn on or turn off if you don't press it precisely squarely in the middle. This is aggravating when you walk by. The reattempts are many and a pain in A with these switches. 3.) It's gotten better but in the beginning, programming these switches was often a problem if not an impossibility. To function smartly these switches must communicate with the cloud and...well...Cync runs an unreliable cloud in their data center. 4.) The Cync app is unbelievably stupid. It was designed by somebody who has no Smarthome smarts. 5.) When wiring up these switches, they are far too easy to fry. They have no tolerance whatsoever for any error, however minor. 6.) They are pricey at around $50. Ridiculously so. 7.) Despite having the ability for the light-ring in the switch to emit white, red, blue, or green, you can't program the switch to display any colors other than white. 8.) You can't program the motion-sensing switch to automatically turn off after leaving the room IF you first manually turned on the switch. 9.) You can't program the motion sensing switch to not turn on automatically and blind you at certain times of the middle of night like when you get up to go to the bathroom. 10.) The WiFi capability of these switches only work on the overcrowded 2.4GH spectrum and require a SUPER powerful and ultra efficient router, an expensive one, in order to work as reliably as possible.",

        "text": "I originally had a 3-wire switch that seemed to work just fine, except in my application. Let me explain. I replaced my ceiling fan which is deemed to be \"smart\". Nowadays that means some form of app control, but really only mean there is no wall switch and only a remote. It does have an LED light kit and that's where the 3-wire Cync switch ran into problems. Namely, it seems to condition the power on the load wire in a way that disabled (permanently off) the light kit. And you have to use it in line with the load wire in order to power the unit, which it draws from the difference created by the load. Bypassing the switch solved that problem, but not my needs of using the wall switch position for a switch to turn the Cync light strips (indirect lighting) on/off. Sure a solution would have been to go with a wireless switch, just that this version doesn't support Alexa and most importantly doesn't feature the glow ring which I quickly grew attached to. In my situation, the wall switch previously powered outlets until I repurposed it to power my old fan. Hence, I had a neutral wire to work with and that enables the use of the 4-wire version. My inquiries about that application returned generally that the load wire still is needed and therefore it's unlikely that the 4-wire version is the solution. However, when reviewing the specs it turns out that the neutral wire (in addition to the line) provides a closed circuit and it's a bit unclear what the load wire does (other than providing to a light fixture albeit not controlling it). For my needs, I tried to simply connect the wires to the available line and neutral, but not use the load wire as that was already bypassed (to mentioned fan). According to Cync, the Load wire is mandatory, even in the 4-wire design. Then again, unlike the 3-wire version, there is no minimum load requirement, which technically means it could be 0W or even open. It sure confirmed to be true and once I wired neutral and line to the switch, it booted up even with the load wire (red) disconnected. Problem solved! The switch is recognized by the app, and controls my CYNC full color light strips as intended. The brightness control works well, too. And of course the soft glow ring around the switch is there, too. A positive side effect is that apparently the 4-wire dimmer switch is currently on sale for $29 whereas the 3-wire version costs more. The latter is theoretically more versatile, but may affect devices on the load wire more than desired. Hence, if there is a white (neutral) wire, the 4-wire switch works better for me.",

        "text": "I love the style of these switches. Love the color changing led hardware. The Cync app isn't that bad. With some additional software updates such as controlling the led color this could have been the perfect switch. The reviews about connectivity issue could because their in home Wi-Fi is not setup properly. But it has one major hardware flaw. The button is hard to press!!! Like how do you mess that up? The most basic functionality. Let me be clear, you will not notice this when installing the switch because you will test it by pressing the center of the button. But if you are trying to walk and press the button sometimes it does not register even though you will hear and feel a 'click'. I called support and found out this is normal. You basically have to press the center, top or bottom of the circle to register the click. Pressing on the left or right side, you will hear and feel it click but nothing will happen. If you want to quickly use the switch as you walk by or have your hands full and try to use the elbow it, you will run into this issue. And I know its a first world problem but it is so frustrating. I ordered 40 more of these switches and was about to change every single switch before I realized this problem. I'm just disappointed as this could have been the perfect product and the price well worth it.",

Even if I switch the switch off, the lights keep flickering. (It's the switch because when I replaced it with an old one, the lights work normally again). 5) I called for tech support (they kept trying to find something else wrong, to put the blame elsewhere- \"can you think of anything else that may have damaged the switch?\" \"is it the lightbulbs?\" \"Are the lightbulbs GE?\"). Then I was told since they couldn't figure it out, they would escalate it. FORGET trying to even figure out if there is a warranty - tech said it could be 30 days or 90days or...

I could just open the app and turn on/off the light switch. The new Cync app is terrible. You have to create an account with them, you have to enable iCloud, you have enable lots of online services that have nothing to do with turning on and off the light switch on the wall right over there. I even raised this up in the app store and they just shrugged. Yep. No online account? No ability to control the physical device you paid money for.
