Only one complaint--instructions did not say what size drill bit was needed to install anchors in sheet rock. I used anchors that I already had and knew the size drill bit needed.",

Doesn't make me think any better of the product, but it's handled by good people. Maybe I just had a dud given the other positive comments; however, it's not a product I recommend. Original review: Complete waste of money. Worked intermittently. Sometimes it would click on immediately, other times very slowly, then other times not at all. And it's not like you can trouble shoot in an app. You simply have no idea why it's not working. Unfortunately, I ordered a couple weeks before it was actually installed in my new light, and by the time I'd had 2 weeks of it not working as expected and getting fed up and removing it, it's outside the return window. Don't make the same mistake. Don't buy.",

Its a particularly frustrating when trying to shut things down for the night and your there trying to turn it off over and over. I moved it to 8 feet away and it still could not work as advertized. Making a remote light switch is not a new technology and should not be a difficult task for a decently equipped company. Don't waste your money get a better brand.",

        "text": "READ THIS TROUBLESHOOTING TIP: If after installing the wireless switch to control a light fixture it turns ON but not OFF or it requires many pushes off etc. AND you are using an LED light bulb, remove the LED bulb and try an incandescent bulb. If it is now reliable and you still want to use an LED purchase a \"dimmable\" bulb. I've had good luck with Phillips bulbs. These are semiconductor switches and there is a technical reason they don't work well with LED bulbs.",

I did not want to relocate this light switch, so I bought this remote light switch so I could access the covered switch. This remote works great! It has a low profile so while it does not lay flat like a normally installed light switch, it only protrudes about 1/2” but doesn’t look out of place. The transmitter needed to be hard wired in place of my covered switch, but if you know how to install an outlet or switch, it is very easy to do. You will want a face plate to cover the transmitter.",

        "text": "I bought 4 of these with the goal of being able to remotely operate four fixtures. I installed the first, and found it worked intermittently. It could turn the light on and off, much of the time, but often required multiple attempts. Occasionally, it would not operate at all. Since I intended to install four switches, I decided to try a second one, and maybe it would work perfectly. But it worked more or less like the first switch. Operations succeeded intermittently, but failures were not identical to the failures of the first switch. Then I looked at the reviews more carefully. Reviews ranking the product from 1 to 3 stars almost always cited the intermittent behavior. This convinced me that the product design was inherently at fault. I returned all four switches, including two remaining that I not bothered to open and test. I wanted remote switches that worked perfectly. Intermittent behavior is not acceptable. My recommendation is to avoid this product until a new product replaces this one, and the new product corrects the intermittent failures of the present product.",

Every switch got replaced with these. Miracle workers!

These are amazing and surprisingly simple to install and program to the switches.",
