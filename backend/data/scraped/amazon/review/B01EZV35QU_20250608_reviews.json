        "text": "I've bought 12 TP-Link smart light switches over the past 3-4 years. Two weeks ago, one just stopped working. I figured, okay, stuff happens. But then—boom—another one dies the following week. The day after that? A third one goes out. That’s three failures in under two weeks. Out of curiosity, I checked TP-Link’s website. Surprise, surprise: the warranty is only 1–2 years. Guess what? All three failed right after the warranty expired. These things aren’t defective — they’re engineered to fail once you’re no longer covered. That’s not a coincidence. That’s a planned-obsolescence scam. These smart switches are not “smart”—they’re a stupid waste of money. Regular light switches last 10–20 years, while these overpriced plastic toys can’t even last two. DO NOT BUY these switches. I don’t care how fancy the app is or what brand it is — TP-Link or otherwise. If it needs replacing every couple of years, it’s trash. Stick with old-school switches. They’re cheap, reliable, and they don’t leave you in the dark — literally.",

        "text": "The Kasa Smart Light Switch HS200 is a fantastic upgrade—and you don’t need to be an electrician to install it. Just take note of your old wiring setup before swapping in the Kasa switch. The printed instructions in the box aren't great, but the product description and YouTube videos make installation very straightforward. Pro tip: check behind your wall plate with a flashlight before buying to ensure you have the required wires. The whole process took me under 30 minutes—just remember to cut the power at your breaker box. Set up was smooth once I downloaded the Kasa app and created an account ahead of time. The LED ring can be hard to see in a bright room during Wi-Fi pairing, and expect a short wait for a firmware update after connecting. Alexa integration was seamless—it appeared instantly in the app once linked. You might need a file if your box extends past the wall to get the plate level. If your box is recessed, small plastic washers are available to bring the switch level to the wall—don’t use metal ones, as they’re not insulated. I had no problem using the existing wall plate with the Kasa switch. After 3 months of use, it’s been rock-solid. Highly recommended!",

        "text": "One of the most frustrating things about these and the other TP Link/Kasa models, is that the information about using 2.4Ghz wifi is discreet. I spent a few hours troubleshooting before I found it in a thread on a forum. I believe some of these are returned due to folks not being able to find this information, and they get stuck trying to set the units up. The only other trouble I've had, is one (out of about 10) units will sometimes be delayed, or it will turn on, then right back off instantly. Only happens on occasion, but makes me wonder if it's safe. Otherwise no big issues. To set up, I had to force my phone to 2.4Ghz wifi, otherwise it just spins and fails....even though it says it connected to the unit, it won't finish the set up. Hope this helps others.",
