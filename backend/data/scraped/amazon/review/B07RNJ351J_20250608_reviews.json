        "text": "I don't know why more lamps and devices don't come with an in-line slider or dial — glad to find this replacement! I took apart two lamps, spliced the cord in, and it works like a charm. Because my lamps in particular didn't disassemble down to the terminals, I used some heat-shrink tubing at the point of wires connecting. I didn't solder, but that's also an option if you worry about the lines coming apart. Two things to know: 1. The cord length is short. You basically have to have your lamp right next to an outline. And since you can't move the dimmer box up and down on the cable, it may end up in an awkward position. 2. As others have noted, the rotation isn't purely linear. Basically the first 50% of rotation has no effect, leaving all the dimming action into a relatively small range of motion. Still, it's much less bulky than the plug-in dimmers which introduce an extra 6 feet of cord all jumped in the same place.",

If you're like me, and you thought you could just plug your lights into one end and plug the other end into the wall, well, you'd be wrong. After my initial shock at finding the exposed wire on one end (seriously, WHY?), I gave it my best attempt anyway and wrapped the filaments around the prongs of my lights (which seems like an extremely dangerous thing to have to do...) and plugged it in. when the dimmer switch is turned all the way up, my lights work at full strength. anywhere else and the lights have a very fast strobe/flicker effect...still at full brightness though. I bought this specifically to help with my video making setup and it's utterly useless, unless I was going for an \"epilepsy warning needed\" vibe. terrible product and very disappointing. will be pursuing a refund with amazon because screw this. Do not buy!",

        "text": "They arrived on time and in mint new condition. They have heavy cord leads but the dimmer casing was on the cheap side, but still durable. I bought these quickly and upon doing more research I found a lot more that are cheaper and have a much higher wattage rating. So they work fine for the 120watt rating they provide and dim the lights very smoothly, just more better options are out there. I do recommend these dimmers only if your looking for this type and style, I do not recommend if your options are open to function over style to my family, friends, and all who read this review. I hope this review helps...Happy shopping!",
