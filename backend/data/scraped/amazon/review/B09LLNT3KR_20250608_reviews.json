        "text": "I installed three of these switches two months ago. Last week, one stopped responding to the switch. It could still be controlled by the app, but the physical switch did nothing. Last night, the other two wouldn't work when I tried to turn them on. Again, the app works but the switch itself is useless. Now I get to remove and replace them with something else. They are out of the 30 day return window, and the support number goes directly to voicemail. I emailed them, hopefully I get an answer back UPDATE: I received this response from the company- Hi, Thank you for your email. We apologize for the inconvenience. Don't worry, we are here to help you. Could you please try these steps? 1. Please kindly turn off the breaker and turn it back on. This usually fixes this type of issue. 2. If not working, please try to knock the switch 5-6 times continuously using your knuckle. After knocking, turn the switch on/off to see if it works. If you don't knock the switch again, please repeat this 4 times. 3. Then, press it to turn on and off to check if it is working this time. Please let us know whether this helps. Thank you! I turned the breaker off and on , they did start working. I've never had to do this with any other switch, so that doesn't bode well for their quality. I'm not sure how I feel about their go-to for fixing electronics being basically \"Punch the switch repeatedly until it works\". That doesn't give me that warm fuzzy feeling either.",

These switches are fantastic and a fraction of the cost of some other brands. The installation was quick and straightforward, and they connected to the app immediately without any hassle. The integration with Alexa and Google Home works seamlessly, and it’s been so convenient to control the lights with voice commands or through the app. The switches are UL certified, which adds peace of mind, and the 4-pack is a great value for the price. If you’re looking to make the switch from other expensive brands, these are highly recommended for their reliability, ease of use, and affordability!",

The app kept disconnecting, and it took multiple attempts to get the switches to pair with my Wi-Fi. Even after setup, the switches were inconsistent—sometimes they responded to voice commands, and other times they didn’t. The requirement for a neutral wire was also a hassle, making installation more complicated than expected. For a 4-pack, I had hoped for a reliable product, but these switches fell far short.

Anyway, these have worked flawlessly in Home Assistant in combination with the Tuya Developer Account and Smart Life app. There is literally no delay (NONE) between the time I press a button in HA and when the switch turns on/off.

The great part is that customer service is very helpful and everything in the end was great. I'm happy to have purchased these devices. Notes: 1. Make sure when connecting these devices thru your smart phone, that your smart phone is connected to the same WIFI you want to connect the light switches to. I have multiple WIFI's and that was a time consuming issue to figure out. 2. When using the Gosund app to connect your switches, every time i tried to connect, the app said it wasn't successful and it times out. This is is not true, even though the app times out, I learned that the switches were connected regardless of this error. This wasted a lot of my time of trying to reconnect my switches when they were already connected. 3. When connecting these switches to Google Home, make sure you label the switches correctly, and I found that connecting one switch at a time works best instead of waiting for all of the switch to be active online at one time.",

I had them installed by an electrician and they worked great. In the process of having some work done in my house, one went bad. In June 2023, I bought four more and had them professionally installed in July of 2023, replacing the bad one. I also had a dimmable one installed. A few months later, the dimmable one wouldn't reconnect to Alexa, and now one of the others is completely dead. In November of 2023, I wrote to Gosund explaining that my brand new switch was dead. They asked for receipts and other documentation which I sent. I heard nothing back. I just wrote to them again asking if there was any resolution. They sent an email with additional instructions, falsely claiming they had already sent it once. Now I'm supposed to make a video, upload it, and send the link. I've already spent too much time on this. I'll just buy another brand.",

The whole thing took about 15 minutes, including removing the old switch, installing and pairing it on my phone. \"Hey Google, turn on the family room lights,\" a wave of odd awesomeness (AUsomeness), came over me and the lights turned on and I couldn’t help but smirk like a 5 year old kid. Setting up timers, and schedules makes things easy. And lets be real, when its 1230am and im about to lose myself in a simpsons mini marathon, me setting Its not actually being lazy, I didn’t get the switches because im too lazy to turn off the lights, I got the switches for energy management, as well as better living through technology, as you can see from my other reviews, im a bit of a tech junky/nerd. These switches will hopefully allow me to reallocate my resources to focus on other pressing matters…like global domination from my amazon reviews. Someone sponsor me already, caaaamaaaan!! 180k annually (to start) along with other perks is all I ask for. Looking forward to getting messages on how I can be a professionally reviewer.",

        "text": "Of the 4-pack I purchased, 2 were installed a year ago. Yesterday I replaced one of those two and installed another, and my other switch from a year ago also failed during that maintenance. In both cases, they stopped working even as a dumb switch after the breaker had been flipped. One was in the kitchen, and the breaker flipped because the microwave and another appliance were on at the same time (neither of them pulling current across the switch--just the same circuit). Once the breaker came back on, the green LED at the bottom lights up, but pressing the switch doesn't have any effect, and they also show offline. Yesterday, I replaced the failed switch, and installed another since I had my tools out. I turned the breaker to a different room off and on a few times (off to verify circuit and change switch, on to test installation before buttoning up, off to button up, on to use) to install it. And that caused another Gosund switch on the same circuit to fail in the same way. The green LED at the bottom lights up, but the switch won't power the lights and it shows as offline. Holding the switch down for 5, 10, 30 seconds has no effect. Both switch installs were less than a year old, and were properly grounded. Gosund has offered to send me (but I haven't yet received) replacement switches. But, I don't have any reason to expect the two new ones to behave differently. It's not horrible replacing switches, but neither is it something I care to do over and over just to keep my lights working.",
