        "text": "I’ve used different brands of ‘smart switches’ in the past but figured that I’d give these a shot for the new place (I already have Wyze cameras). Installation was pretty easy (if you know how to change outlets/switches) and getting it initially setup in the app was a breeze. After that, I got them added in Home Assistant and have been running them without issue (normal operation, automations, scenes and with Echo). The price point is pretty good, they’ll work with other/different wall plates, and they don’t look bad at all. I do wish that Wyze offered these in Zigbee, Z-Wave, or Matter (instead of just WiFi) but I knew what I was getting when I ordered. My only real complaint at this moment is the “status” light. For some reason, Wyze thought it was best to have the status light on when the switch is on and off if the switch is off. Personally, I wish that the “status” light was on when the switch is off and off when the switch is on. I’d much rather be able to get a hint to where exactly the switch is when I’m walking around in the dark; I don’t need a little LED to tell me the light is on…I can see that but I can’t see the switch location when it’s pitch black. You can even put it into a Firmware update and give us the ability to choose when the status light comes on (not just status light on or off).",

I installed one and within 3 weeks it would no longer work. I am familiar with the product and after trying every option I contacted customer service and asked for a replacement for the one faulty switch. I provided MAC, purchase date directly from Wyze and was told they would contact me. A couple days later I received an email from Wyze asking for a photo of the MAC and to provide Proof of Purchase. I responded back that I had already provided the MAC and to look at my account with Wyze from Proof of Purchase. Never heard another word. Business must be good. I have 12 Wyze products but this will be my last.",

        "text": "The Wyze Switch has been a fantastic addition to my smart home setup! It integrates seamlessly with my other Wyze devices and offers a range of features that make controlling my lights incredibly convenient. The switch is responsive and works flawlessly with both the Wyze app and voice commands through Alexa and Google Assistant. I tested both, my son likes Alexa for some reason. The ability to create schedules and automate lighting scenes has significantly improved my home’s functionality. Installation Tips Based on My Experience: Confirm Neutral Wire Presence: Experience: I initially didn’t realize that my older home lacked a neutral wire. Tip: Before purchasing, I recommend checking your existing switch box to ensure it contains a neutral wire, typically white. Without it, you might need an electrician's help or consider a different smart switch. Wi-Fi Connectivity: Experience: I had some trouble connecting the switch to my Wi-Fi network at first. Tip: Ensure your Wi-Fi is 2.4 GHz since the Wyze Switch doesn’t support 5 GHz networks. I also moved my router closer to the switch during setup, which helped avoid connectivity issues. If you are using the Wyze Routers make sure to split the bands in your settings. Tight Wall Boxes: Experience: Fitting the switch into the wall box was challenging due to its size. Tip: Carefully arrange the wires and use electrical tape to bundle them neatly. Make sure there’s enough space for the switch to fit properly without forcing it, which could damage the wires. Overall, the Wyze Switch is an excellent product that delivers on its promises. With the right preparation and a bit of patience, installation is manageable. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade their home with smart lighting!",

Automatically turn on/off lights in my house, can control them in person or from anywhere in the world using your smartphone (have to have an internet connection of course on both sides). Definitely that’s not my last Wyze purchase!",

        "text": "I had some difficulty figuring out how to correctly install the switches. The issue was that every switch that I wanted to use a Wyze Smart Switch had multiple load wires and none of them had neutral wires connected to the existing switch. The Wyze support were pretty useless helping with this. They suggested hiring an electrician. No - not going to pay several hundred dollars to have an electrician spend 10 minutes to install a switch. So for each switch, it was pretty easy to find the neutral wire in the electric box and use the wire Wyze includes to connect that to the smart switch. I'm certain the reason each switch had multiple load wires is that these switches turned on and off multiple outlets in a couple of different rooms. The smart switch has room for two load wires - I had one switch that had three to I had to connect them with a lug and get a short run of electrical wire so I could then plug that wire into the smartswitch. Tech support was clueless and couldn't help. Lastly, trying to connect the smart switches to my Android Wyze app was an adventure - it didn't work because of a known problem with their Android app. Getting someone in support to figure that out took longer than it should have. I was able to use my son's IOS phone to add the smart switches to the Wyze app and then he shared the devices with me. Wyze fixed the issue and I reconnected the switches to my Android app (so I could be the \"owner\" of all the devices in my Wyze app). So once I got past installation, I love my switches.",

        "text": "I ordered two boxes of these with three in each box. I've only installed three switches so far, and already found one with dry solder joints. For me, that's not a big deal. I can fix that with my soldering iron. I also found my Galaxy S23+ was incapable of performing the initial setup. I had to use my 'work' iPhone to join them to my Wi-Fi and update the firmware. Once set up, my Android worked fine controlling the switches. They come with a six inch braided aluminum wire for the neutral. It's super frustrating to get the braided wire in the little hole in the back of the switch. Plus, aluminum and copper together in a wire nut is going to corrode over time. So I bought some 14 gauge solid core copper wire to use instead of the included aluminum wire, and I recommend you do the same. For the price, I think they are great once they're installed and working. It would be nice if they included a 6\" solid core copper wire, had better quality control, and better android support, but then they'd be a lot more expensive, right?",

The fact that you have to use the backstabs in these already prove a problem. The terminals are flimsy at best, the outlet housing is way too large to fit in most new construction boxes, and the screw holes cause a misalignment over regular deco style switches if you try to mount in a multi gang box.

But, the biggest drawback, & why I can’t recommend these is that the contacts are not soldered to the copper plate on the inside, with only two small tabs that are pressed into the base, which causes the contacts to break when tightening the screws that secure the wires. The other issue is that when installing/connecting to the app via your Wi-Fi it fails to find the switch, even when the switch is 10’ from your router. While tech support is excellent, it is of little value when nothing they suggest can get the switch to be found by the app. Trying to search again for the switch only results in “Switch not found. Try again?” I have 19 other Wyze devices that work with 95% reliability, but their switches need a complete rethink by their engineers.",

        "text": "I've installed a couple different brands of smart switches, and while they all functioned fine once installed, the installation (in my 70yo house with tiny electrical boxes) was always a PITA because they all required the use of wire nuts. Kudos to Wyze for that choice. However, the big news with these (IF you use Wyze bulbs/outlets/etc.) is the multi-tap functions. I actually converted my whole upstairs to Wyze bulbs once I got these switches. Now, my three-bulb vanity fixture in the bathroom can toggle on/off (single tap), go to 50% warm white (double tap), 100% daylight white (triple tap), or just the middle bulb at 1% and blue (press and hold) for those trips to the potty in the wee hours....all without summoning Alexa! In the bedrooms, I programmed the various tap \"scenes\" to control both brightness and color in lamps as well as ceiling fixtures. Also, the bathroom outlets in my house are wired to the light fixtures (old house DIY from previous owner), so the ability to turn those lights off via a wall switch without disconnecting power to the outlet is great (no more charging cordless toothbrush/razor/etc. in the bedroom)! Wyze's bulbs are almost as inexpensive as no-name smart bulbs, are \"normal\" size/shape, and come in both tuneable white and RGB configurations, so converting was pretty painless. Plus, I already had their cameras, so no need for another app on my phone (and it's a pretty good app as well). For parents of small children, these would be great for silently triggering nighttime \"scenes\" involving night-lights, fans, etc. all from the switch by the door. No more tiptoeing across messy rooms *please no Legos! please no Legos!*, or trying to invoke Alexa in \"whisper mode\". If they could trigger my more complex Alexa routines, that include time delays and IR controlled AV devices, I think I'd convert my whole house to Wyze!",
