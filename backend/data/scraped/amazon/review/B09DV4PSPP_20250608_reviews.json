The old dimmer switches made the lights flicker, so we got these replacements because they were specifically described for this situation. The lights still flicker. I ended up replacing the switch with a standard, non-dimmable switch and it works just fine now. Garbage.",

        "text": "May 22, 2024 - On April 10, 2024, I bought the 2 pack for $19.99. It arrived on time, well packed, and I installed them right away .. Installation was very easy and straight forward. I installed one in a bedroom and one in the guest bathroom.. As some reviews stated, there is a delay on both switches. I did order different light bulbs thinking that maybe I did not have the right bulbs, but no, still same issue, but still, I could live with the delay, no big deal for me. The one in the bedroom still working (for now) delay and all, but over the weekend I discovered that the one in the guest bathroom (that is not used often) is no longer working. I turned the power off, removed the screws and made sure everything was connected ok (it was), but I re-connected the wires and still it did not work. So, I removed the dimmer switch, and installed the old one I previously had. The light is working ok now, but sadly I can't have the dimming capabilities with the old switch. I am guessing I got a defective device that now I can't return because my window to return is over and I do not even have the box it came in. Very upsetting to get $20 down the drain.. I guess it is a hit and miss with these switches, even thou there are many 5 stars, I do not recommend it at all, the old dimmer I have in my dining room still working and that thing is over 25 years old..!",

Really cannot leave them on for more then a few minutes before you start to feel like you're getting dizzy and on an acid trip. Note: Unfortunately, the full effect doesn't come across in the video because of the shutter speed.",

This is normal operation for these dimmers. -Other Issues- I had one dimmer with a loose wire. as you moved the wire around on the dimmer side it would go full bright or barely on, no in between. I also got a nice little shock tightening the screw. The dimmer downstairs has started dimming a few seconds after turning on but brightens to full when slightly dimmed. Long story short I wish I went with something else.",

        "text": "This is an excellent dimmer. I like this type of dimmer design which features a standard size, easy to operate on/off switch in addition a small, narrow dimmer slider - since most of the time I want to turn the light on to a set level. I installed 3 of these in my home and they all work very well. PROS: - I appreciate the short depth (it's less than an inch behind the mounting plate) since my dual-gang switch box has quite a few wires passing thorough it. - Works great on LED-only and LED+incandescent setups. - The small dial for setting the minimum dim level is easily accessible and works well. CONS - The only thing I don't like is that it takes over 1 second to turn the lights on after you hit the switch. I understand that it's better for the bulbs when the voltage level ramps up rather than instantly jumping to 110VAC, but 1+ second is excessive and annoying.",
