You must hook up the neutral wire for these to work correctly. Pre wired with color coded wiring. Easy to connect with the internet and no hub required. The app seems to work flawlessly for me. Very Happy with the Leviton Products. Also if you want screwless wall plates only use the leviton brand, I tried using cheaper ones and they wouldn't sit flush with the wall.",

        "text": "It was simple to wire. Do make sure you have neutral in the box before buying! Recommend down loading the Leviton App ASAP so you can get into the Matter upgrade program. The firmware in the switches currently shipping don't support Matter. Once you have the switch up on your home network (following Leviton directions) go to device settings and Check for Firmware Update Current version supporting Matter is 2.1.25. Once upgraded a new menu item \"Matter Pairing Code\" will appear. Click this and write down the 11-digit code. The go to the switch and hold the top paddle for 7 seconds to put the switch in Pairing Mode (flashing green led). Go to your hub controller and add the new Matter device using the require procedure for your hub and the 11-digit Matter Pairing code. Let me add that I contacted the Leviton support, and they did their best to support me. Now that I know the process I may buy this switch again - but first it has to pass my break in and reliability tests.",

I wish it was possible to directly automate from things like fire alarms but you can utilize these third party tools to 'cobble' something together. I requested direct support for a fire alarms feature from the manufacture but they have not committed to it. When I did have trouble with one of the devices the email support was top notch.

        "text": "Who needs a Wi-Fi wall switch?! We do!! It is so convenient and links to Alexa and the phone app. The contractor added them to a kitchen renovation and we asked for a couple more in two other rooms that have ceiling lights. The dimming transition on both old and new led lamps is very smooth. Save the boxes that have the barcode (for setup purposes) in case you need to add them to a new network or you sell your house.",
