        "text": "INSTALL: Instructions were lacking if you don't have prior experience installing light switches. The wire nuts that are provided worked on three of the connections, but my husband had to find a larger nut for the fourth connection. PAIRING WITH ALEXA: Pairing was pretty efficient once the Gosund App was installed on my iPhone. You can control the switch via the Gosund app, Amazon Alexa app, or voice control with Alexa. Using these controls, you can turn the light on/off or dim. You can also create a routine which turns the lights on/off according to a set time. MANUAL CONTROL: This switch is very responsive to the touch of a finger, easily turning on, off, or dimming. BOTTOM LINE: This switch works great and I'm quite pleased with it. I love that it can be controlled via an app in addition to my Echo. 5 Stars.",

You may want to make sure you have a junction box with enough space to accommodate the additional wire and wire nuts. The cover plate supplied is a snap-on cover, no screws needed if you have dual switches that are a rocker style you will not need to purchase an additional cover plate.

It's a 4 wire install and everything is labelled well as to which wire is which. Bluetooth was aan easy pairing, but you have to go through the Gosund app first, then share it to your Alexa. Once you have Alexa paired, you are good to go. Voice activation for on/off and dimmer is very easy, there is even an event timer si you can pre-set on in the morning, off after you leave for work, then setup the same for when you get home and for bedtime. The timer doesn't need voice to activate, it does its thing based on your system time. Very cool feature. I think the price for this one is very fair and so far I haven't had any issue with the switch!",

Dimming Control is not as described like 1% to 100%. It is an incremental of some 15%. A touch-sensitive interface switch is great. No flickers in low light. It was hard to set it with it's own app \"GOsund\" and it only accepts 2.4Ghz wifi. Then it was easy with Alexa app. Though I was not able to set with Google Home or asisstant It has added feature of Schedule and Timer which is great, I hve not used so far.

        "text": "This is a nice dimmer. I already have the previous model installed in another room. This one has several big improvements. Capacitive strip doesn’t have false readings when you press the switch to turn on the light and accidentally touch the lower end of the strip. Firmware prevents it from erroneous dimming. To dim after you turn it on you really have to lift your finger and then touch the capacitive strip. SmartLife interface was also improved. It now allows locking the minimum brightness at 100% so you could turn this dimmer into a discrete switch if you plan to use it with non-dimmable lighting. Added countdown function allows to run timers on the new switch hardware, so timer automations will work without stable internet connection. Also you can now set the recovery state to on, off or last known before power or Internet connection failure. Machine screws, wire connectors and snap-on faceplate were included.",

Like other smart switches, it has a push on/off functionality and a capacitive tactile dimmer that works by sliding your finger up and down the switch. When paired with LED lights, there was some LED flicker at various dimmer levels that I did not encounter with my previously smart dimmer (that failed after 4 years of use). I was able to sort out that issue with the app but it took a little time to mess with the configurations. This is a nice-looking switch and hopefully lasts longer than my last one.",

Be aware that the electronics in a smart switch always need to be active so this switch does require a neutral. - includes decent wire nuts (the switch has pigtails not terminals) - did not include screws to mount the switch. It DID include the typical short screws for attaching a switch plate but the plate for this switch is a clip on style, not screw on. So this was a QC fail on the manufacturer’s end. Fortunately I had an inventory of the longer screws needed for mounting. Pairing to Alexa: The instructions are less than helpful in my opinion. They explain how to pair with their own app or with their “gosund” skill. Going with either of course requires you to set up an account (yet another smart app account - ugh). Fortunately (and unstated) the device will pair with the Tuya app, which most people have. In this respect it pairs up to Tuya-> Alexa as most devices like this do. Dinging this 1 star for not explaining the method to pair with Tuya. Otherwise, device works as advertised.",

I love that it can be installed and functions just like a normal dimmer switch, or it can be fully controlled by Alexa using simple voice commands to fully automate an unlimited number of customized scenes and scenarios. I have now installed several smart, undercabinet, LED lighting fixtures, and I plan to use this dimmer to control and automate all of them. I will create a group called countertop lighting and will be able to control all of the lights with this dimmer or just with my voice. Nothing could be easier! And at the end of the day, when I turn in one simple voice command turns on my night lights and turns everything else in the house off except for my bedtime music which plays for about 45 minutes softly before turning off along with any remaining night lights. With this cool technology, I can now control all of the lights in my house, my thermostat, my fireplace, and music in any and all rooms. And I can do all of this using very simple voice commands from any room in my house, or even from my iPhone while I’m away. This is very cool technology that brings great convenience and provides an enormous amount of functionality limited, perhaps only by your imagination and comfort in dealing with fairly simple technology. I can hardly wait to install this new switch Which will allow me to fully control my counter top lighting while I’m working in the kitchen, using only my voice.",

        "text": "The Ghome Smart Dimmer Switch has made my life so much easier! My original light switch is located far away from the actual light, which used to mean a lot of back-and-forth trips just to adjust the lighting or turn on/off. With this dimmer switch, that hassle is completely gone. I connected it to Alexa in minutes, and now I can simply control my lights with my voice. it’s such a time-saver! The dimming feature works smoothly, and the Wi-Fi connection has been reliable so far. My only suggestion for improvement would be adding a customizable backlight on the switch for easier visibility at night. Overall, this smart dimmer is a fantastic upgrade for anyone looking to simplify their home lighting.",

        "text": "As with any electrical project - make sure that you know what you're doing. Safety first - turn off electrical/circuit going to the swich & consult an electrician if you're unfamiliar/uncomfortable with the process. That said - installation of the switch was fairly straightforward & easy. It is in-line with the installation of any standard electrical switch. The switch does have leads that hang off of it, rather than attaching the electrical wires directly 'in' to the switch, but it isn't a huge deal. If your electrical box is tight, this could add a little bulk to the box. Make sure that your wire nuts are on tight, as it is easy for the switch leads to slip off of the wire/out of the nut if not done properly. Pairing to the device was also 'as expected.' I use SmartThings, so as has been the case with many other smart devices that I have in my home, I was able to get the switch paired, so that it could be 'imported' into SmartThings - which allows the different devices to talk to each other & react/trigger one another. To me, this is a key component of a smart home. Overall, I'm happy with this switch & happy to recommend it to others.",

You will need a common (normally white) wire. Remember to turn off the power before you or anyone else starts the installation. The box does get a little crowded but with a little work you can get them all in. Set up for Alexa was pretty simple. You do need to download their Ghome app. There are instructions included. At the bottom of the switch is where you manually turn the light of and on. The center has a long indentation with several leds. This is where you manually dim the light. The leds track with the brightness of the light when you run you finger up and down the switch. A single led stays lit when you turn off the light showing you where it was when turned off. Works well for me. Hopefully, it will for you as well.",
