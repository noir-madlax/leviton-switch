Factory reset didn't fix it. Time to find a better brand. Also worth noting: Some features of this dimmer aren't supported by Home Assistant/ZWaveJS. For example, even though the zwave parameters show up in ZWaveJS, changing the LED indicator color doesn't work.",

This switch worked fine until September 2024 when it failed in the same way as the old switch. The difference is that the old switch was 9 years old before it failed. There are also two other similar switches in the same box on the same circuit controlling different lights. They are also old and work perfectly, so it's not a problem with the circuit or the box. I replaced the switch with the second one that I bought as a spare in July. We'll have to see how long this one lasts.",

First, the good. it has decent instructions and comes with a neutral jumper wire in the box. it doesn't take a lot of space compared to some zwave switches in the box. It looks good, although it's a bit brighter white than some of my other switches. I had to reset it before it would pair with my smartthings hub. Once I did that, it worked right away. The biggest issue with this product is that it's range of dimming isn't friendly with many LEDs. When shutting it off, it tries to dim down and that causes flickering. It also seems to flicker in the 30% range with my fixture quite badly. LEDs are extremely common now and some of the newer wifi based smart dimmers let you calibrate a dimming range. This switch does not have such a feature. I feel like if it let me limit dimming between 100-50% it would be fine.",

I finally resorted to a Youtube video and found out that you must factory reset this brand before it will be seen. I don't understand this, since it's brand new out of the box why would it need to be reset? So I performed the reset by tapping the top padding 10 times very quickly and then the bottom paddle 10 times. Then SmartThings saw device instantly and it works great. The dimmer function also works well on my LED bulbs. Overall it's a great value compared to other brands.",

        "text": "Pros: Paired easily with my ZWave hub and has very good RF performance. Overall tactile feel is crisp and satisfying and gives a quality impression. Supports pre-staging on-level by programming default brightness level (parameter 32). Cons: The default dimming speed is very slow and there's no way to change it, which is ridiculous. I intended to use this with the 3-way add-on switch to control a fixture having three LED bulbs. Initially the fixture had EcoSmart bulbs which flickered badly when dimmed, so I swapped them out for Sylvania TruWave LED bulbs which are highly-rated for dimming performance. With the Sylvania bulbs, dimming up/down is smooth and flicker-free, almost as perfect as incandescents. HOWEVER there is a BIG problem: whenever the lights are dimmed, every few minutes they flash full bright! This spoils any mood set by dimming the lights. Unfortunately this glitch disqualifies the UltraPro ZWave dimmer for me and ultimately I went back to Insteon dimmers which are more expensive but work great.",

I think all of these smart switches are made by the same company (Jasco) because I have GE, Enbrighten, and now these UltraPro and they all look and work the same.
