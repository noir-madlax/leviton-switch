        "text": "Unless you are installing this in a Single Gang {one switch position} Box, you need to make sure that the other switch function is available. For instance a two gang box with another switch is okay if that is a one or three way switch. If your house is like mine and open plan room and 4 way switch {more common than many think} the 4 way is hard to find. Make sure to obtain everything you need before starting the project. - Another caveat. Unlike most older dimmers, you need to wire in 'Neutral' to the dimmer. It is not always available in any given box that has a three way. _____________________________________ Recent remodel, opened up a 20 year old kitchen/ dinette / dining room to one long room. Installed LED BR30 in 11 cans for total lighting load of 150 watts which is the LED limit of most cheap dimmers. This necessitated a hi-load dimmer OR split the strings to 2 circuits each with a dimmer. When I happened on this at Lowes and saw it could easily handle the load, thought 'why not' Unfortunately what I thought was a 3 way sharing the box was 4 way. Now the 4 way is on back order and I had to kludge to continue use the old 4 way. Now for the good news, the dimmer handles the 150 watt load great, barely getting warm to the to touch, the action is smooth and the double tap for full on is fine. Again.. make SURE you have a neutral available in that box.",

        "text": "This thing is sweet! I have it connected to patio lighting. The 30-second fade feature is a bit funky (slow fade to about 50% power then a sudden shut-off), but it is still very cool. While the first post-install setup felt like too many steps, those steps are fairly intuitive. Once set up, operation is very simple. Now I have bright light when I need it and mood lighting when I want it. Sweet.",

        "text": "I am not a handyman and have never done any electrical work prior to installing this dimmer, so my review is based on what I experienced during the installation. I've been using this for 3 months now. Though the Adorne styling was a little strange at first (since 99% of light switches are different from this one), it's really grown on me and many guests have asked for details on where to get them. Pros: - Looks fantastic - Good quality construction. Though most everything is plastic, it has a solid feel with good fit and finish. - Very functional (returns to previous dimmed level if you turn the light on) - Night light allows the switch to be seen in the dark - Works very well with LED bulbs (I used dimmable Philips BR30 2700k LED bulbs) with no flickering - Self-calibrating feature at the end of setup works very well - Works in standard or 3-way configuration without extra hardware - Includes all necessary pieces (even wire nuts, which I hadn't considered), but you might need a wire stripper - Easy to install. I know another user had trouble, but I followed the detailed instructions included with the bulb and felt like a professional when it was complete in 15 minutes. The only thing I'd say with this is to make sure you have the in-wall piece oriented correctly, because it's hard to read the labels on the wire terminals with no overhead lights and the box is fairly symmetrical. Cons - A little pricey - Will not well with non-dimmable bulbs, based on reviews from other sites. This should be obvious, but I struggled to find something to be unhappy about.",
