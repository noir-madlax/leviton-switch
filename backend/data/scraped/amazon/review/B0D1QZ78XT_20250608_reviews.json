This is the 3rd LED dimmer I bought / installed, and the only one to work as advertised. The little adjustment wheel does a great job of letting us dim the bulbs quite low for savasana with no flicker. We've been paying for incandescent light (and putting up with warm to the touch dimmers, overheating / failure prone bulbs) for too many years - LED tech (bulb color and rating) and dimmer tech has finally evolved to the point where we're not compromising on light quality. Nicely packaged, easy to install, very happy! Thank-you!",
