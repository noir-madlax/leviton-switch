It was very easy to accidentally leave the light on and the closet door closed and you wouldn’t know it until after dark when you could faintly see a light leak around the door frame. I replaced the existing light switch with this one and now if the light is on inside a red indicator light is visible outside of the closet. It was an easy swap-out but the new switch required a common wire connection that the original switch did not have. The instructions did not make this clear, so I called the manufacturer and they advised me. Fortunately I had a capped-off common wired in the back of my outlet box that I was able to activate and use. I had to remove the switch and reinstall it but it now works perfectly well. Now whenever the internal light is on, the external red indicator light lets me know. This change did require a new plastic switch plate that I bought at Lowe’s for less than a dollar.",

        "text": "I have purchased this switch on two occasions, one online and one from Home Depot. While both perform as advertised they are different as follows. In both cases the instructions included are sub-standard. They can be figured out, but it takes a little time. I've purchased other Leviton products and the wiring diagrams seem to have been done by a draftsman with little or no knowledge of wiring principles or conventions. The switches received function the same but appear to be from different vintages. On one version the signal light is a narrow slit, so dim it is not noticeable from a distance. The one from Home Depot has a brighter, more visible light. The switches have changed but the instruction have not kept up. They perform their intended purpose but were given only three stars because of nebulous instructions. A very minor item is that the switch operates left and right rather than the more conventional up and down. Till you train yourself you find yourself try to operate the switch in the wrong direction.",
