        "text": "I got this pack to replace a bunch of gross almond colored light switches in our home that was built in the 70’s. My husband is handy and had absolutely no trouble installing these. I’ve pictured a 2 way switch installed photo to show you how it looks, and a comparison to our old 2 way switch. It’s a much bigger box, but the switch itself is not quite as long and there’s no on/off words for the toggle. Neither of those minor things bother me in the least bit, but I felt they’re worth mentioning. For the installation, the words on the back go just like you’d expect - they are right side up. At least, that’s what we’ve found to work for all of ours. We’ve only used five so far, but we haven’t run into any bad ones or problems. Great product. Happy to have found it.",

        "text": "Finally got around to using these switches I bought for a project. Unfortunately, they aren't Leviton quality... They work, but they feel and look low quality; the toggles are shorter than other switch brands, so things look a bit off when combined with other switches in same panel, and the action feels and sounds very \"clicky\". Another reviewer noted no \"on\" or \"off\" labels; but this is normal for a 3 or 4 way switch, as there really is no \"on\" or \"off\" position. As noted in product description, no back wire option, so you have to form a hook on each wire; not a big deal, just more of a pain to install, especially a 4 way, needing all 5 wires. If someone were paying me to install these, I'd definitely be looking for something else.",

Seller AIDA lists these as \"AIDA 15 Amp 4 Way Toggle Switch Self-Grounding Indoor Quiet Turn ON Off Toggle, Residential Grade, UL Listed, Side Wired, 10 Packs, White\". I had a toggle switch fail and decided to give these a try. This 10 pack of Residential Toggle Switches is UL listed. The switches have appropriate J Box screws and screw terminals on each side as well as a ground screw. (Picture 1). These can be used to do 4 way switching with a \"traveler\" wire and come with a diagram. I did find that these switches as noted in their title and description DO NOT have push in wire connector points on the back (Picture 3). This is clearly stated by the seller but it is a fairly standard feature on most switches and outlets and detracts from the overall usefulness and ease of installation rating. Also, close examination shows NO \"ON\" or \"OFF\" letters on the plastic toggle. Most switches have that lettering. The toggle action is firm and positive without a \"snap\" sound like older style toggle switches. Without care one could easily install a switch upside down accidentally - you can tell only by the ground screw located at the switch bottom if you don't pay attention to hot and neutral wire colors. Consequently I have given these a 4 Star rating. Recommended with limits stated.",

The white color was exactly what we were looking for. - The electrician showed me how he installed it. It seemed very straight forward and easy to install (he didn't have any luck with our smart switches). - The switches seemed quiet and sturdy when I turned on and off. Solid 5* if you're looking for basic switches",
