Newer Jasco aka GE Embrighten aka UltraPro (all the same, Ultrapro is simple packaging and cheaper priced but same hardware) in white do not match the older ones. The New models have bluer paddles, don't match old ones. Older ones matched faceplate from Leviton at Home Depot. See picture. New one on the right. If you have old, dead devices, you can salvage their paddles to make them match. But note the pull plug under the paddle of dimmers and switches is longer in the new model, so you'll have to use that bluer pull pin with your older, color matched paddle.",

Firstly I put the switch in standard mode since I have dumb switches in the circuit. After that, I tried operating the switch from the z-wave switch, and although the status changed, the switch did not turn on the lights. I then went to one of the dumb switches, and again the status changed, but the light did not turn on. The seem to only work well either in a single pole setup or with the companion switch which is not the ideal setup for me, so I am going to try other options.
