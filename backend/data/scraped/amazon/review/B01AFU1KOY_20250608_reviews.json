        "text": "I have been surprised by the number of software updates, often with new features. I wish my house wiring was better and these switches were less expensive $25-$30 would be fair. Sometimes I have problems with google assistant and Apple Homekit. Apple homekit is a pain to setup but I blame Apple for this as that issue spans multiple manufacturer devices. I have one switch in kitchen that gets reset by barstool chairback and have to connect with homekit often. Sometimes google loses track of devices. The Leviton app always works well. I like that the dimmer switch can also be on/off. Customer support has been good. Works well with counter part devices for multiple locations (used both wired and wireless). I like that it can work with Homekit, Google and Alexa (smart being agnostic). The 26HD is well built. Installation can be tricky, as switch takes up more room in box leaving less room for wires.",

I recommend reading the instructions for both switches before installing them, because I had one mostly installed before realizing the switches can’t be installed interchangeably. The one that is NOT the companion has to be the one hooked up to the load (light). One other item important to note is that this doesn’t work exactly like a 3-way switch. One of the wires has continuous power, and the traveler wire is used to communicate between the switches. I somehow kept missing the section in the instructions that show the line wire and wire going to the switch both being connected to the same screw.",

One April Fools day the lights in my house randomly started turning off or on when we didn't command them to do so. Support at Leviton claimed they had a system upgrade and it went a little buggy, but was then resolved. My feeling is some programmer left an easter egg in their code and they didn't want people to know. Outside of that, the control of the lights ran awry the same way one other time in the 3 years since I've had them, but it wasn't April 1st that time. Not sure what it is, but if it keeps happening, it would be something weird",

Installation was straightforward per the instructions. For me, the total time to install and set-up in a +100yr old house with older wiring was less than 20min from start to finish. Getting this via Amazon was a good value and had a significantly quicker delivery, and the cost is similar to, if not lower than, my local suppliers. The bottom line is that I recommend them.",

        "text": "The DD00R-DLZ Companion Dimmer is required when converting from a conventional 3 or 4-way setup. It/they get connected to the line (hot) side, upstream from a Leviton D26HD which gets wired to the load (i.e. light bulb) and does the controlling. I must admit I struggled to get it wired right on the first one I did. I just did another 3-way and a 4-way set of switches and it went smooth. The resulting smart switches look nice and function as you would expect a modern, quality dimmer switch should. I highly recommend them. Only the D26HD needs to be added to the Leviton app for firmware and setup, for these switches are just messaging that switch. Any activity performed on these are mirrored by the D26HD as well as the other companion switch in the case of a 4-way setup. Although i would not order a D26HD from Amazon Warehouse, for when I tried what arrived was often only the package containing some other switch. I would recommend getting the companion switches that way for you can often save $10 or more per switch. I've ordered 1/2 dozen thru the warehouse, and so far all worked and looked perfect. I suspect because of the clear window present in that switch's packaging, people are less likely to try swap out what they return. Perhaps Leviton needs to add a window to all its packaging or Amazon needs to open and inspect returns better. Update 9/24/2022: I spoke to soon (perhaps I jinxed myself) for of the two I ordered from AW, only one contained that switch. Now I must wait for another to ship before I can make my 4-way hall switch smart. It was interesting to find a more expensive Leviton D215S (2nd gen smart switch, non-dimming) was within the Leviton DD00R-DLZ packaging. Fortunately I found a use for it, so didn't have to go thru the hassle of returning it.",

You can always control the lights from the master switch, but the remotes only work occasionally. I have spent too much time with customer support trying to get them to work. I'm an electrical engineer. Leviton customer support verified that I installed them correctly. Their only suggestion is that I should upgrade the software in the switches. This requires a Wi-fi connection, which isn't up and running yet in the new house. They were not amenable to replacing the switches, or allowing me to return them. I don't have the time to play with updating the software IN A SWITCH! I don't recommend anyone buying these switches unless they want to spend hours getting them to work with questionable results. I do have to say that I have installed dozens of Leviton smart switches and remote switches without dimming control. They have always worked flawlessly. That's why I took a chance with these smart switches with dimming capability. I am going to throw them in a box and install conventional 3-way/4-way switches and give up the ability to dim the lights. The box will probably find the landfill eventually.",

        "text": "I reviewed the main switch separately, it works well, and does everything I wanted, so I won't go into details. Aside from functionality, installation was a bit unorthodox. One of the travelers hooks to the same lead as the hot, which is not a problem but might be unexpected. My prior dimmer switches didn't need a neutral, and since this needs one but didn't come with a neutral lead built in, I couldn't simply attach it with the existing wire nut. I had to make my own lead. Likewise, I had to do the same for the ground since my prior switch had a ground wire attached, rather than a screw to attach a lead. Some Leviton switches have wires in the back instead of screws. That would have made it easier for me to attach the ground and neutral, but more awkward for the other wires since it's easier to attach the existing bare ends. A compromise would have worked, or they simply could have included leads in the box. Update: After about two years, my wife tried it and said that it doesn't work. Leviton support was good and told me to tap the bottom five times, and that fixed it. The switch can get disabled by mistake, which Leviton told me sometimes happens with small children who repeatedly press it a certain way, and the solution is not in the instructions, but if anything at all doesn't work with a Leviton product, call them and they can help.",

This is one of the few 3-way dimmer setups that is also \"smart\". It integrates with Alexa well, and the \"My Leviton\" app made setup easy. This dimmer along with the main switch (DW6HD-1BZ) will both show the current dimming level along with the app. You are also able to set the dimming level via Alexa like any other device. I have this for an LED light fixture, and it has worked flawlessly so far. You do need to have a neutral wire available in order to install this in a 3-way setup. I highly recommend you goto the Leviton website which has an excellent installation video. It is way better than the included instructions and make installation mush easier to understand.

        "text": "I used the master Wi-Fi dimmer in a previous installation but I now had a three-way installation I wanted to repurpose the switch for. This combination is a pain to install since it's very specific about which side the load is connected to and both switches need to be connected to hot and neutral. Only one traveller is required in this installation (I guess a plus) so I repurposed to other traveller to pull my load over to the other switch (due to the configuration). The quality of this companion dimmer is significantly inferior to the master dimmer as this really feels like cheap plastic junk. The LED indicators lag the master, controlling dimming levels has a very significant lag (hard to dial in a specific dimness from this device), and you can't turn off the dimming indicator as you can with the master. I won't be buying more of these in the future.",

Finally all worked for a number of months and now 4 of my 5 switches will not respond to app commands. The app says they're not connected. I did the factory reset on all and none can be reconnected. With the 5 command switches and a few of these three-way remotes and the color faceplates, I am over $300 into this stuff and basically have switches you have to go to and physically turn on. At least that feature still works but I could have just spent $30 for manual switches. Consistently, these are of poor quality. Buyer Beware!!!!",
