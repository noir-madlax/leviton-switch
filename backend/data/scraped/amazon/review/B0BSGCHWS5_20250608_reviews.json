Two of the switches did not work - light wouldn't come on - so I am not even opening the other three. I know what I'm doing - no trouble shooting will fix a defective switch internal mechanism. I did a lot of work to try and figure out the problem but as soon as it was replaced with Leviton it works perfectly, so it wasn't the circuit. I tried Enerlites as a cheaper option to Leviton but I'll never do that again. Stick with Leviton - don't waste your time on this cheap crap alternative.",
