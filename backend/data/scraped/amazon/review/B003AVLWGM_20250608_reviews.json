        "text": "In the midst of updating our home’s lighting setup, I came across the Leviton 5634-W 15 Amp, 120/277 Volt, Decora Single-Pole Combination Switch. The idea of consolidating two switches into a single unit appealed to me, especially for areas where wall space is at a premium. Installation Experience Installing the switch was straightforward. The side-wired terminals provided a secure connection, and the clear labeling minimized any confusion during the process. It’s evident that Leviton prioritizes user-friendly design in their products. Functionality and Design Post-installation, the switch operates smoothly. The rocker mechanism offers a satisfying tactile response, and the Decora style seamlessly blends with our existing fixtures. The white finish is clean and modern, complementing various room aesthetics. Durability and Build Quality The switch feels robust, indicative of its commercial-grade construction. It’s reassuring to know that it’s built to withstand frequent use, ensuring longevity. Final Thoughts For anyone looking to optimize their lighting controls without compromising on style or functionality, this combination switch is a worthy consideration. It offers the convenience of dual control in a single, sleek package.",

I was surprised to see the line screws were black. It is 2 single-pole switches that can be fed by one line in or 2. You just have to remove the input side strap between the 2 inputs for 2 separate lines in. I had a motion detecting light switch in our hall half-bath that works great unless you want to sit a while and the light wants to go out. I removed the adjacent vent fan switch and used one of these for the fan switch and tied the other switch to the light so turning on the new switch keeps the light on no matter what the motion sensor does. Just gotta think ahead before you sit down 😀 and remember to turn it off before you leave. You know, like any regular light switch.",

BE OBSERVANT when looking at switches, some have ONE line terminal feeding both switches, these are very common and easy to find. The other has an individual \"isolated\" line terminal for each switch. Think two indiviual switches in the same casing. These are not easy to find and will take a bit more effort to locate. THIS SWITCH has the individual \"Isolated\" line terminal for each switch. Silent operation, switch movement is side to side This type of component is usually installed by an electrician, but some HANDY home owners can install this fairly easily as well. BE SURE to power off the circuit before attempting any electrical work. I recommend this switch. I did not receive any money or product for my random review 230123 1618",

        "text": "Update 10/11/24: So, the 3rd replacement Leviton dual switch just bit the dust 26 months after install. Same failure point, the plastic pivot \"ears\" break. Revised rating to 1 star and do NOT recommend. When the switch fails, the light will be left in a constant ON state, meaning you either need to unscrew your bulbs or throw the breaker to turn the light off until you replace the switch. 8/15/22 Original Review: This is the 3rd Leviton double switch I have installed in a powder / laundry room that receives moderate traffic. These switches have lasted between 3 and 5 years. The design defect involves the fulcrum point where the switch buttons pivot. These switches operate like a playground see saw, rocking On one way, then Off the other. Unlike the pivot point of a see saw, which is steel, the pivot point in each separate switch uses two small plastic ears (or tabs) at the top and bottom (they orient perpendicular to the side to side direction of the rocking motion). These small ears, or tabs, bear all the force of each press On and Off, and eventually one ear snaps off, and you need to buy a new switch. If Leviton could use some sort of metal pivot point that clips into the back of the plastic switch, the life of these switches would be significantly longer than the 3 - 5 years I typically get.",

        "text": "I've used the Levitron 5634 for years, but recently maybe in the past few years now they've switched to plastic internals underneath the rockers. While this makes it a little bit more quiet to operate, it really weakens the switch over time. In the past, I would maybe go through one of these switches every year (kids are hard on it), but with the latest design using plastic internals, I've already had to replace 3 of these in the past 4 months now. I attached a picture of the latest switch that broke on me again. These are the same ones that Home Depot also sells & carries. I've since replaced my dual rocker single pole light switch with better ones that use metal internals. You can immediately tell by the difference in quality when you flip the switch, as it's louder and more mechanical sounding, and it feels more sturdy overall.",

        "text": "This is now the 3rd time that I need to replace this switch. This last one only lasted a year. The first two may not have been this specific Leviton switch but it seems that no matter what I replace this with, the switches start malfunctioning and the light will come on despite the switch being in the off position. Having to fiddle with the switch rocker itself to find the \"right spot\" to turn off the light is something we should have figured out in the early 1900's. I do have boys and they are not exactly subtle on our light switches but this is the only one that keeps breaking. This has to be a simple design flaw in how the rocker snaps into off vs. on. UPDATE: Replaced with an Eaton brand and can already tell the difference in quality. I expect the Eaton to last much longer than this similarly priced Leviton.",
