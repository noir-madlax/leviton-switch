        "text": "I recently installed the GHome Smart Dual Dimmer Switch and I’m really impressed with how well it works. The 2-in-1 control feature is awesome because I can easily adjust the lighting for two different areas with a single switch, which is a huge space-saver in my home. The WiFi connectivity is seamless, and I was able to set it up with my smart home system in no time using the app. The dimming feature is smooth, and it lets me adjust the light intensity just right, whether I want it bright for reading or dim for a cozy atmosphere. I love being able to control the lighting remotely through the app or with voice commands via Alexa or Google Assistant. It’s convenient, especially when I’m in bed or outside and want to turn the lights off without getting up. The switch itself has a sleek, modern design that blends well with my decor, and the installation was straightforward, even for someone who’s not super handy. I also appreciate how responsive it is—there's no lag when I adjust the lights. Overall, the GHome Smart Dual Dimmer Switch has definitely made my home smarter and more efficient. It’s a great option for anyone looking to add smart controls to their lighting system, and I highly recommend it!",

The dimming function was unreliable, and sometimes the switch wouldn't respond to voice commands at all. I also noticed frequent connectivity issues.",

It works easily with Alexa. However, It is difficult to set up in the Gosund app (have to do this for Alexa control). because the instructions are inaccurate and I have almost given up. There are no flashing lights when it goes into setup mode. I happened to go to the WiFi network list on my phone after doing the reset and found a GOSUND_<MacAddr> network and connected to it and it set up. They should really be clearer that this unit (the SW7) does not have any indication it is in setup mode. This is a documentation issue.",

Esthetic looks good and I really like it fits in a single slot in the wall. The 3 stars come from post sale service. year and a half and the switch stopped connecting to my wifi, Nothing has changed, I do have other smart devices in the same network. Tried resetting the switch, disconnecting and connecting again and couldn't make it work. Wrote in their contact form and haven't gotten any response after a couple days. Hopefully they can help me figure out what may be wrong and diagnose if it can be solved or have to get a new switch.",

        "text": "I installed this dual dimmer switch for the kitchen at my daughter’s house. She bought five led recessed lights, three for the kitchen and two over the kitchen sink divided in two separate circuits. So far, we haven’t encountered any issues as mentioned by other reviewers here. For example, one reviewer mentioned that the switch did not include electrical wires. Well, the switch does not have built-in wiring. You insert the circuit wiring from the wall into its corresponding connection in the switch, i.e. G, H, L1, L2, N, and tighten the respective screw. Another reviewer mentioned that they couldn’t figure out how to turn the individual circuits On/Off. Although I didn’t read the included instructions and don’t know how clear they are when it comes to using this feature, it’s very simple to use. One circuit is controlled (turn On/Off) by pressing the upper part of the switch, while the other circuit is controlled by pressing the lower part of the switch. For example, in our case, pressing the upper part of the switch will turn the kitchen main lights On/Off, while pressing the lower part of the switch will do the same for the over the sink lights. As for the reviewer who mentioned about constantly having to reconnect the switch to the app, this could be caused by loose wiring, either within the switch or somewhere within the electrical circuit. One thing my daughter was not too happy about is that as opposed to the manual non-WiFi dimmer this one replaced, the intensity of the lights do not go down far enough for her taste. Other than that, she’s very satisfied with the way the switch operates.",

It functions very well, and I particularly like its design. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with Alexa, making it easy to control with voice commands. This switch is great for my usage because I was able to run additional wires and control my ceiling set of lights with two controllers. I can have half of them on or dimmed, or have them all off or dimmed. Overall, I’m very satisfied with this purchase.",
