One of these switches was not new. One of the switches had been used and repackaged. The wires on this unit were twisted and the lengths of the leads were different. I don’t appreciate being shipped a used unit when I paid for a new one. When I installed them they both worked properly but I was also disappointed to hear a buzz (hummm) from the units when switched on. Not super loud but noticeable to me (and my wife says I don’t hear well :)",

When it is in this state, adjusting the brightness slider only serves to change the frequency of the flashes, and a simple off-and-on-again always resumes the flashy state (cutting power at the breaker seems to reset it). It is correctly in LED mode, with dimmable LED bulbs, and the minimum dimness has been tuned. For $60, I expected something a little more refined.",

It works perfectly, with no hum/buzzing, no flickering, and generates almost no heat. The dimmer slide works very well and provides smooth dimming. Having just installed it yesterday, I am leaving the lights on most of the time as a test and playing with the dimmer slide. Works perfectly so far.

When in the wall and a cover on, there is no buzz from the dimmer. There is a slight hesitation when turned on - I presume this has to do with getting the power set to bring the LEDs on at the desired level. It is noticeable but not annoying. On the plus side, this dimmer does not cause a \"flash\" when it turns on like some LED dimmers do. Note that there is a small \"locator\" LEd on the switch. You have to pry the cover of the switch off to set it up. The default is \"off\". Me not reading the directions, I spent about 15 minutes wondering if that was broken.. then durrrrrr I read the directions and all is well. This switch is part of a 3-way circuit. The other switch is a simple on/off 3-way switch. You cannot use two of these dimmers on the same circuit.",

I replaced the old 12V 50W MR16 bulbs with Feit BPEXN/930CA bulbs. The Leviton DSM10-1LZ worked fine but the lowest dim level was much brighter than the Lutron DVLV-600P-WH. For that reason, I prefer the Lutron model. FYI, here are the wattage readings I measured before and after for twelve MR16 bulbs. I did not measure with the Leviton dimmer installed. Before with halogen MR16s: Full brightness: 660 Watts; Lowest brightness: 112 Watts After with Feit BPEXN/930CA LEDs: Full brightness: 121 Watts; Lowest brightness: 15 Watts I'm sure I could get a further wattage reduction if I bypassed the 12 magnetic transformers on each fixture and installed a single electronic low voltage transformer at the beginning of the lamp \"daisy-chain\", but given the expense and hassle of doing that, I can live with what I have now as we don't run this light string very often.",

Switch on and off or have the option to dim the lights further if needed with a slider on the right hand side so you don't have to repeatedly hit the switch to dim the light and hope you didn't hit it too many times. I find this to be easy to use and easy to get just the right amount of light. Overall, we are very happy with this switch and if the need arose again would look to purchase this item.",

        "text": "I installed this in a 3-way circuit that has 3 ceiling can lights. I have LED Oppo brand flood bulbs in the fixtures. This dimmer handles them beautifully, dimming all the way down to a very dim light (maybe 5-10%?) with no flicker. I like the positive \"click\" of the Decora switch when you turn it on and off. And the the dimmer slide stays put at the setting you want unless you intentionally change it - meaning it does not change by accident when you use the switch to turn the lights on/off. The rest of my light switches are Decora, so this matches them nicely, with three different color faceplate options. One thing I had to figure out when wiring up the 3-way circuit was that there was 1 red and 2 black wires coming into the old switch. But this dimmer has 2 reds and 1 black. The black wire is supposed to connect to the \"line\" or \"load\" wire that always has power. I didn't know which of the two black wires in the wall that would be, so I connected the wrong one the first time (the one that went to the other switch rather than to the power panel). The lights worked OK from the dimmer, but the second wall switch did not turn the lights on. Once I swapped the two black wires, it worked perfectly. If you have a multimeter, you can test the wires before you connect them and find that one that's always 'hot', regardless of whether the second switch is on or off. That one goes to the black wire on this dimmer.",

Except that the fixtures had a pre-existing dimmer from the 90s, and the LEDs were always acting....strangely. So, I installed the Leviton Dimmer as a replacement. Now, a quick note: I didn't think about the fact that the switchplate cover would need to be replaced. But that's my own \"duh\" moment. Grab yourself a basic switchplate cover for a thick switch. Install was easy, as it only needed one position and I was replacing an existing switch. Kill the breaker, make the swap, go the hardware store for a new cover when you realize the old one won't fit. After that, it operates well. The dimmer provides a good amount of control. I would have like a darker brown option on the switches, but I'm changing the décor colors anyway. Easy enough for the do-it-yourselfer, even one who watches 3 Youtube videos about switch wiring before he tackles it.",

I replaced this and another switch at the same time. The other came with the both of those, but no different color for switches. Make sure your kind of light is included. The other switch I replaced was for LED & CFL. My light was actually some kind of electric low voltage and the transformer blew a few days after installing the switch (which seemed to be working perfectly until it blew). This seems to cover the low voltage light that I will replace with an LED. It was as easy to install as any other switch. The toggle feels a little \"soft\" when using it - no solid clicking when turning the light on and off. When it is off there is a tiny green light on at the bottom of the switch. It is not very noticeable but would be enough to guide someone to the switch in a very dark setting. I see that it can be turned off, but it is so tiny it is not intrusive and I like it on.",

        "text": "This switch is quiet, offers a continuously variable level of light, and doesn't produce any buzz. It has the look of any Decora switch, but with a small green light at the bottom when turned off, and a smooth slider lever on the side. This switch will work as a standard two way or as a three way switch. Since the dimmer level is mechanical, it means that in a three way installation, the other switch should be a non-dimmer type. If you want to be able to dim or brighten from either switch, you will need a different type of switch that doesn't use a sliding lever. The switch comes set for LED/MLV/Incandescent, which is how I used it. It also has a setting for CFL that I haven't tested. If you are using it that way, make sure to use CFLs that are labeled as dimmable. You may wish to read other reviews to find out how well they work with CFLs. There's also a procedure to set the minimum light level but I found that the range from low to high worked well for me right out of the box. If you find that the light flickers at the low end of the range and you are using dimmable lights, then you can set the minimum level a bit higher. Also, you should make sure that the full dim position doesn't turn it off completely, especially if you are using it as a three way switch. There are other types of dimmer switches that give you more flexibility on three way circuits, but if you are replacing a standard light switch, this should fit the need well. Since you may be replacing a standard switch with a dimmer switch, chances are that switch has wires pushed into holes or twisted around screws. If so, you will need to get wire nuts since they are not included.",

This one does perfectly. I didn't even have to adjust the trim for brightness. It was only a couple wires and I kept the white faceplate - so about 10 minutes until we got a fully functioning light switch. The only thing I wonder about is the price value. This is a pretty expensive non-smart home dimmer. And adding smart home to a dimmer only raises the price online about $10 or so. So why not build that in? In all, though, I'm very happy with this product.",

        "text": "There are so many variants of the basic dimmer that it can be confusing, but I think this is a safe bet for most people looking for a basic traditional design that works with LEDs. By \"traditional,\" I mean analog, with no need for a neutral or ground wire. The downside is that the switch doesn't have the pleasant dim in and out animation typical to digital dimmers, or the coordinated dimming in 3-way applications. I used it with an LED light, and it works well with no flicker. Keep in mind that the transformer in the light may cause flicker at low voltages with any dimmer. Installation is easier than normal, with the wires already installed. That means you don't need to mess with screws or push in connections. A ground is present, but not required for functionality. Build quality is good for the price, though the face plates are slightly flimsy. Overall, a good classic dimmer for modern lighting.",

I appreciate that Leviton includes multiple colors for the toggle switch so I was able to exactly match what was in my house. One thing to remember is that if you install this in a multi-pole environment (multiple switches for the same light), the dimmer setting that the slider is set to will always control the brightness of your light, no matter which switch you use to turn things on or off. So if you previously dimmed the light and then turn it on from another room, it will still be dim and you'll have to go back to the other room and move the slider if you want to change it. I think that is a good thing but I can imagine it would cause problems for some uses.",

Ac 120v UL Listed (Pack of 4)\" (https://www.amazon.com/SleekLighting-Dimmable-Spotlight-Recessed-Lighting/dp/B0156X9416). Note that these bulbs are not on their approved list (pretty short list). This was to replace a Maestro dimmer that was already in place for the halogen bulbs (that dimmer flickers with LEDs). Single pole installation was as easy as any other dimmer. Connect a couple of wires and it's good to go. Once installed, I noted that the minimum intensity was a bit too bright for my taste. So, using the instructions, I set the minimum as low as it would go. Although the minimum was now very acceptable, turning on the lights causes a \"flash\" of light. It appears that the switch is starting at what the normal minimum is and then lowering it rather than starting at the set minimum. I could actually see the lights dim after that initial switch to on. Had that not occurred, I'd have given it 5 stars (especially considering the bulbs were not \"approved\"). Note that I don't know if this would occur with \"approved\" bulbs. In the end, I ended up going with the Lutron DVCL-253P-WH (even though its minimum appears a touch higher that the Leviton) because of that flash. I'm still keeping the Leviton to use where the minimum threshold isn't as important.",
