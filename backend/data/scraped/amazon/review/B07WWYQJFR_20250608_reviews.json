But these switches in four pack have a very different interface in the smartlife app. It’s is very confusing…for example “on” and “off” are replaced by “ switch open” or “switch close” …. What ????? They have different modes when you try to set a schedule have no idea how this works. They need to go back to old software interface. This is awful",

        "text": "These are great initially, but our switches have been failing a little over 2 years after the first install. 4 switches have died within weeks of each other. We mistakenly bought another set to replace the first failure — it kept disconnecting and needed to be reset until it no longer responded. After we replaced that, 3 others followed and we’ve noticed another start with the same issues. We have Leviton switches in other rooms that have lasted longer without any failure or connectivity issues. Unfortunately, we will probably be stuck with continually replacing these as we are not confident the rest will last.",

Now 10/18 are either dead or offline. Most still function as a dumb switch. Not entirely sure of the reason… we do lose power fairly often. Some of the failures occurred upon a power loss so maybe they are sensitive to line spikes/noise. Anyway, I’m now replacing them all and will try a different brand.",

        "text": "I recently embarked on a large home renovation project and decided to install smart switches for all my lights, ordering 20 TreatLife switches, along with multiple 2-gang and 3-gang wall plates. Unfortunately, this decision turned into the biggest headache of the project. During installation, my electricians discovered that the TreatLife smart 3-way switches didn’t work with the other TreatLife 3-way switches and would need to be paired with non-smart switches. The lights would randomly go to the dimmest setting. Worse, I had no choice in which side the smart switch went on due to existing wiring, leading to awkward placements where smart switches were alone, and non-smart switches were grouped with others—resulting in a messy, unattractive look (see images). I contacted TreatLife, and while each response took a day or more, they finally confirmed that their 3-way smart switches only work with 3-way non-smart switches, WHICH THEY DON’T EVEN MAKE! Not very smart for a ‘smart’ switch company. They offered no solution for the mismatched look, and to top it off, refused to accept returns on the unopened switches that would not work with their other switches as it had been over 30 days. I ultimately found a solution with Lutron Caseta switches, which allow two matching switches on either side of the 3-way configuration through an innovative remote that can be installed to look just like the hard-wired switch while allowing way more flexibility with installation locations since no wiring is needed for the remote side. The result? A seamless, functional setup I love. While it required an additional investment and another electrician visit, the new system is worth every penny. If you want matching switches for your 3-way lights, STAY AWAY FROM TREATLIFE!",

        "text": "These were great while they lasted. I bought a dozen for my home. Right around the three year mark they all began to fail one by one. The physical switches start to lose their sensitivity and responsiveness. At this point each switch requires numerous presses in various locations in order for the switch to respond on or off. The company does not stand by their product outside of the warranty period. Here is their email response to my case after providing them with video evidence: “For your case, the switch should be broken. Treatlife stand by 24-month warranty. Your order was placed on April, 2021, which has passed our warranty period. Or if you still have other order?”",

Sometimes over time and sometimes right away, eventually your lights will start to flicker because of the quality of the switch. Eventually or right away it allows a tiny bit of power to flow through the switches causing the lights to flicker or sometimes you’ll turn the switch on in one room and lights in another room will come on. I know that it is the switch causing the problem because I am a journeymen electrician and after replacing the switches to regular dimmers they stopped flickering. I like the switches, they work well with Alexa but I wish the quality was a lot better.",

Since then I’ve had to replace many of them. They either lose network connection for no reason or just flat out stop. Like won’t even work by manually pushing the switch. If your house has frequent power hits, forget these completely. They will fry. Where as brands like Kasa and Lutron in my house still work perfectly fine. if you have a lot of them they will take up a crazy amount of your bandwidth on WiFi. The thickness of the switches is an issue in smaller switch boxes. A couple of my boxes where there were numerous wires these switches had to be practically forced into, which caused a couple to not work. Yet again used another brand to fit in those boxes. Just the other day went to replace one that had randomly quit working and the new one won’t program out of the box new. With all that said I won’t ever re buy this brand and will replace with other brands as they fail",

I can only conclude that the switch failed in the first 24 hours of service. I don't know why it failed. It's all rather disappointing.",

        "text": "I spent $850 over the course of a year changing all my switches to Treatlife products to manager dozens of recessed can lights, bathroom fans, ceiling fans, etc. With so many switches and kids, I thought it would be great to be able to dim the massive amount of can lights and also control them to keep lights all over the house from being left on. The theory is great but the switches are not. I have fought several to keep them on the network constantly resetting them. Several have been replaced. Several are not working now and I had to put the old toggle switches back into one fixture. I have a mesh network so signal is never a problem. Every time we have a power outage of any sort, many get messed up and have to be reconnected to the network / app. The newest versions I bought as replacements are even harder to get online since they “automated” the process. I have 2 that cannot be synced and are brand new. 3 out of the 4 fan light combination switches have failed. Naturally some that I have the most trouble with are in the basement and I have to go down to turn off one switch out of 3 that my kids left on even after using the app to turn off ALL basement lights. I contacted Treatlife about some of these issues and they wanted me to go thru all the programming steps and tell them what happens at each step. I explained it is not even turning on so I cannot make it do anything. Then they said I must have made a mistake wiring them. I am an engineer and have wired several houses and barns including fixing others mistakes. This is all run around to avoid warranty claims. They won’t stand behind the high failure rate products. My advice is to limit your installations to only devices that benefit from connectivity and avoid the headache and expense of such a buggy system. Definitely not worth the hype for a whole home install. And definitely not worth a wife being upset the lights or ceiling fan is not working.",

Every time that the wireless mesh network (eero) updated I had to go and relink all of them. Finally with the latest update, they just refused to link at all. I have been using the Wemo Alexa skill and it is weak at best. I replaced four of them in the garage with these units in about an hour. They set up very easily and QUICKLY. And they work GREAT with Alexa. I ordered four more. No more Wemo. What a pain to maintain them.",

I spent 3 days trying to connect the switches to the app. I tried both apps SmartLife and TreatLife. It does not make any difference. I tried AP installation, but the Wifi hotspot that it creates would not even stay on for more than 30 seconds and the app spins for 2 mins and then it shows a generic message.

Nothing really wrong with the existing switches except for the indicator led (Red for on and Green for off) are failing on random switches. The new ones look good and have a white lit circle when they are turned off. Looks clean and neat. Will buy another 4 pack when these are installed.",

They all work with the SmartLife app which keeps everything in one app for ease of access. I had a couple of devices fail early after installation but TreatLife was very quick to replace the defective devices. Great products and great customer service -- I will stick with TreatLife for all of my smart home switches and accessories!",
