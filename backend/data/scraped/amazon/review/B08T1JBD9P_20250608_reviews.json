        "text": "So far 5 stars. I bought this one and another brand for a bathroom remodel. Both are going to control lights that can be dimmed. This brand worked well right out of the box. There's a main power on off switch at the bottom. Once it's on, you can leave it on and turn the lights on and off with the toggle. If you want to dim, turn the lights on, then hold the toggle down until the light starts to dim. Opposite, hold the toggle up until it's at the desired brightness. Easy enough! Plus there's a small dim warm-white light within the toggle so you can find the switch in the dark. The other brand I bought, the internal light was blue, and would constantly flash (I'm assuming because it wasn't connected to the internet yet). The controls worked pretty much the same, but more buggy, more delayed, and sometimes backwards. So I'm going to return it. I saw some reviews stating that the switches don't fit in a multi switch panel. To that, I'll say that my house was built in 1998, and these switches fit right in with no issues. They do provide a slight amount of wiggle room where you screw them into the wall, so make sure it all fits before you tighten everything down.",

I'm not sure why it suddenly stopped working, but I'll be taking it apart after I replace it. But beyond that, this entire family of switches have this extremely annoying behavior where when the WiFi goes out it just switches on and off repeatedly until the connection is restored. I would prefer it so that it just stays in whatever state it was last in until the internet connection is recovered. It was extremely annoying when we had WiFi issues.",

I installed these shortly after receiving them and they worked great. For about 10 months. Then we had some storms and and a lot of power outages. While I have most things on battery backup, light switches are one of those things you can't protect. During those storms they lost the wifi connectivity. I can accept that really and had experienced that before, the main problem with them is that they stopped accepting the command to reset, so ultimately I could never reconnect them to the wifi network. And this wasn't just one of them, it was all of them. They have been blinking at me for the last 4 months while I decided on which switch to replace them with. Now that i have decided these are going to the landfill. It is a huge waste.",

        "text": "I bought this mainly for 2 reasons. First, it fits in my existing 4 switch box and looks (somewhat) like a normal switch. Also, it uses the Smart Life app which I currently have several other devices under. The install was pretty straight forward if you understand wiring for switches. I was using this on a single pole light switch so it was fairly straight forward. I figured out which was load and line then dug out the neutral wire and added that. It all went in like it should and the switch notified me that it was available to add in the app before I could even get there. It connected and worked like it should right away. It's nice having a real switch to use for the lights but also the convenience of a smart switch to turn it on and off as needed. It dims the 4 kitchen lights I have pretty well and is ready for use in Alexa and Google Home. The instructions it came with are clear and easy to follow. The company emailed me before I received it and let me know of a change in the instructions, though it didn't affect my installation on a single pole. If you already have some Smart Life apps and want a standard (not decorator style) switch, this is the one to get. We'll see about longevity, but so far I'm happy with it.",

Just like that, all is working again 😀 Wiring wasn't so bad, but getting the app to work and then sync to Alexa took a bit of extra effort. It works great, but just zapped a lot of brain cells in the setup process.",

        "text": "Because the Amazon \"questions\" section is such a disaster these days and I couldn't get a proper answer to my question before buying this light, I'll start with what my needs were. My kids now go to bed after me, and they have a habit of leaving lights on everywhere, including the hall outside our bedroom, which casts light under our door and drives me nuts. So, I unscrewed the hallway lights, problem solved, until my wife nearly fell down the stairs in the dark because she gets up early. Sooo, I needed some way to have the light behave normally during waking hours, but during sleeping hours I wanted it on a countdown timer so it would shut off automatically when kids left the lights on while I was trying to sleep. This switch, with the Smart Life app, does that and more. The app was not great for setup - it couldn't find the switch for a while, and, of course, the directions were poorly organized. After about 15 minutes of factory resets and blinking leds and phone clocking, it did eventually work out. I was worried before I could get into the details of the app that I would only be able to put the switch on a schedule, like you would for landscape lights. You can do that, but you can also use the app's \"automation\" functionality to make the lights truly smart. The automation functionality is a well designed interface for creating an \"if/then\" statement for a device. Like, IF it is between 10 pm and 6 am and IF the light is ON, THEN start a countdown timer for the switch lasting X seconds. Boom. Switch is also easily integrated into Google home through the Smart Life app (using Google Home functionality). Assuming it is stable and doesn't break and isn't spying on me, pretty good product. UPDATE: got 2 of these, one stopped working after 3 months - just went offline and never came back. Maybe I was unlucky, maybe I was had, but just putting a data point out there.",

Then I found the paper inside with a picture of this switch connected in a 3 way configuration under the SMART configuration. Here is the trick. Of the two 3-way switches you have one of them must supply power to the currently used 3-way switch along with a neutral wire for the new switch. This will only be at one of the switches so you have to figure that out. This unit works as advertise with no delays or any control issues whatsoever like some folks posted. The key is that the power must be supplied to one of the 3 way switched before starting the project.",

        "text": "Every switch and plug in my home is a smart one and have been for years. Insteon was the best ubtil they went under and the hub failed, causing me to replace ALL of my wall switches at once. Given the expense of the mass replace, I tried the treatlife switches. I liked them, except for the fact they had a failure rate of about 50% after just a couple of weeks. I then went to Kasa/TP-Link - reliable, easy to install, but the dimmers only dim in about 5 increments and can be erratic. So, when I decided to replace my last non-smart wall dimmer switch (I had held off because it is a toggle switch and it shares a box and double wall plate with 2 other toggle switches, which are together, but one on top of the other, requiring a special wall plate So, not wanting to buy a hub for just one switch, I went with this one, apparently from SmartLife/Tuya. As my house is entirely \"smart\", I've gained extensive experience at the installation of all switches, plugs and devices. Plus, I have a 1.2 gig internet connection with unbelievable wifi. This new switch was to be installed within about 4 feet of my router. Of course, it required it's own SmartLife app. First problem/concern arose when I went to use the app to install it and the toggle dimmer was not listed in the app, only the paddle dimmer and they are vastly different, such as the paddle dimmer has a reset button, whiule the toggle dimmer doesn't. Anyway, got it wired easily enough, but then went to program it. First, the switch was almost impossible to get into pairing mode and would keep dropping out of pairing mode. The instructions then made some reference to using two cell phones and setting up a mobile hotspot between the two, etc. It aslo referred to having to perform a reset, using the non-existent reset button and getting the switch to flash blue, which it wouldn't- only orange. The written instructions do not match the app, the app deosn't match the switch, the whole thing is pure junk. All other swirtches have taken maybe 10 minutes to completely install, program and setup with Alexa. After 2 hours of complete failure, this piece of junk went into the trash, not even worth the time, effort or money to send it back. Have ordered a TreatLife paddle to replace it, hoping I get one of the 50% that don't fail and will be customizing my double faceplate to accommodate it. My advice, stay far away from this junk.",

Inspection showed a copper wire protruding through the faceplate screw hole. Backing out the ground wire to make room fixed the issue, but sheesh. You'd think QA would have caught this design flaw.",

I have also emailed the company 3 times and no response back! I would give it a five star but the lack of interest of my concern from corporate is very disappointing.",

        "text": "I have one of these installed for a couple years now and it works well for scheduling my front porch light on and off, as well with integration with Alexa. It's installed with an LED bulb in a canister light - it dims easily by holding the switch up or down. In the app or on Alexa, you can adjust it by a %. This version has a different toggle switch, softer movement than the previous one I installed but works the same. I attached it to a on a 3-panel spotlight with built-in LED panels. I had a GE dimmer switch that required an adapter for a light bulb socket - that obviously didn't work. This is able to dim the fixture without any adapters. I did find that the dimmable range is not very broad. The app lets you go from 1-100% but the fixture only dims between 20-50%, anything less than 20% and it will flicker, anything more than 50% and it's already at full brightness. Other bulbs work fine though, so I think it's just the fixture itself. The install, even with a single pole install, requires you to pull and attach a common line (WHITE), but it's nothing too hard, just harder than a plain old light switch. The connection a router is pretty easy using the Smart Life app, I prefer smart devices that use the Smart Life app over Amazon only devices - I find the integration BETTER with NON-Amazon devices for whatever reason. Now I can say \"Alexa, let there be light!\"",
