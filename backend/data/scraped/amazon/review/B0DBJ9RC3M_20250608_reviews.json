I've installed twenty other smart switches without incident, so I doubt I'm installing it wrong, and this fixture workers fine with a conventional ELV dimmer.

The Caseta ELV+ have worked well to manage an array of low voltage transformer controls, new and old. The documentation in the box is very basic and does not address many of the features this switch offers, and for some reason Lutron does a good job hiding the complete documentation deep in their website and embedded in a document that attempts to cover all of the other switch products at the same time. A simple QR code that goes directly to this products manual would go a long way toward my initial experience. That said they do work well, even with low voltage halogen bulbs, just be sure and add up your bulb wattage and don't exceed 250W. Set up is simple (with proper manuals) and the switches and covers have a quality look and feel. The ELV+ are a great solution for LV transformer control, but they are pricey!!.",

        "text": "I have lots of home automation stuff including three or four brands of switches that I've tried over the years - these are all being slowly replaced with Caseta since it's so reliable. I put this particular switch to replace an older model PD-10NXD. It's connected to a fairly new LED fixture which was flickering almost constantly with the old switch. With this new ELV+ Diva switch, it now seems to be working flawlessly. I also much prefer this style of Paddle Switch to the older Caseta units which have buttons. Highly recommend this switch if you have some newer, difficult to dim LED fixtures/bulbs. For more standard lights, the standard (non-ELV+ Diva) switches are working great for me and are roughly half the price of this one.",
