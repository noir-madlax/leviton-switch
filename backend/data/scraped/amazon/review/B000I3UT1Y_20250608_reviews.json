I was not able to use my two switches because they leaked voltage when a LED bulb was connected. The two switches that I purchased worked correctly with incandescent bulbs. The build quality for this switch was of good quality but the LED indicator (locator light on the switch) was so tiny that we could not see this light from a rooms distance. I wouldn't purchase this if you're looking for a locator to find the switch in the dark.",

So, I took one & made sure it looked as close to how it does to my eyes in the actual picture.(Thumbnail looks all black, cuz the room(to my eyes) was nearly black. That tiny lit pixel almost perfectly centered is the light from the switch with which I'm supposed to locate said switch) I'd have to wait, I dunno, like a minute after turning the light out for my eyes to adjust to be able to see that light well enough for quick acquisition. I'm looking at replacing this one with a motion detection switch. The switch works fine, & the locator light does turn on when the switch is in the OFF position, so it gets 3 stars, but the whole point of installing one of these, vs those locator-less ones that cost 1/3 or less, is to be able to quickly locate where the light switch is. Come on guys. A PinHole?? I'm not sure what you were thinking there, but if it's gonna provide such little 'locatability', you should probly update your product page/info to reflect that so buyers can make more informed decisions vs writing less than satisfied reviews such as this. Honestly, I can only see this being useful in a small closet where the pinhole light is aimed right at yur face when you open the door. -_-",

After I installed this light, I noted that the locator light was a miniscule pinpoint at the switch edge which is difficult to locate in the dark even when you are looking for it. I was expecting at least one of the 2 rocker panels to glow like my preferred brand but it did not. I do not believe this switch detects motion as the review template implies.",

The small LED on it is not really noticeable during the day but at night when it is dark it stands out just enough to make it easy to find. The rocker feels solid and clean.",

There is a pinhole sized LED just above the rocker that illuminates in the darkness. At first, I wasn't too thrilled about it, however, I love them now! The small LED keeps the switch looking very chic during the day and at night illuminates sufficiently to allow you to find the light switch. Additionally, the tactile feel on the rocker is excellent and smooth. It will not randomly toggle on and off.",

        "text": "I purchased this lighted wall switch since I am looking for a 21st century solution for lighted Decora switches. Why is this so hard? Old switches are illuminated by an orange neon bulb with an average lifespan of about 10 years. My request is simple: A decora wall switch with an LED on it to light it up in the dark. Must look good (some options you find for lighted switches are VERY 1970), be reliable, and put out just enough light to be visible. No need for wi-fi, phone apps, internet connectivity, etc. I just want a lighted switch. Legrand is a good brand name that I recognize. Some other switches out there look cooler (there's a glass touch one that looks REALLY cool but has absymal quality ratings) but I don't want something that will fail early or worse, burn my house down. So I opted for this switch, recognizing that reviewers here commented that the light is TOO small/dim/subtle. My thoughts: The switch seems substantial to the feel, matches the regular decora switches and is very simple to install. If you take more than 10 minutes to install this switch then you are working too hard. :) As always, be safe and make sure the circuit is de-energized before installing. Connections consist of hot, load, and ground. No neutral wire is needed. The illumination: Other reviewers are right. The illumination is a TINY white LED, literally about the size of a pencil point. I have attached a picture to this review - and it makes the LED look bigger than it really is! It's visible in no-light situations as a white dot but doesn't light up the switch paddle area. I think that Legrand should have made the LED a little wider (think narrow rectangle, I know they make LEDs in this size) and they'd have a winner on their hands. Note that the pencil point LED *is* the LED and is not a hole allowing visibility to an LED in the back - so you can't drill out the trim to make the light bigger. Since the lighting effect is a little TOO subtle I'm giving this about a 5 out of 10. Overall I like the switch and I like the idea behind it, but I think I'll keep looking for a better solution for an illuminated Decora switch. That's a bummer because this one definitely has potential and I'd like a lot more lighted switches for my home.",
