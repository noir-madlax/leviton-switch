        "text": "This dimmer switch fits easily into multiple wall switch box. Relatively easy to install although wires are not secure in the plug-in connectors on back of the dimmer case. The dimming limiting feature does not operate as stated and is really useless as it doesn't work. However the unit does dim the lights from bright to completelny of with no flickering. It's OK, but would not purchase again. Updated: called Aida Customer Service about the dimming setting feature. They emailed a detailed instruction message to me that was a bit different than what came with the switch. My desired dim setting is now set, and I'm adding a star due to the follow through from this seller! I'm now pleased with the product, and can recommend this dimmer. Works great in my 3-gang switch box. Thank you.",

It works as described and was pleasantly surprised about it's ability to adjust the level of dimming. Thankfully the unit dimensions were given which made ordering it much easier removing any doubts about it fitting. It would have been nice for them to mention a preferred wire size and making mention of the wire installation by turning down the side screws after the wire was placed in the rear holes. What can you expect from a dummy novice non-electrician like me?",

        "text": "Please note that there are three caveats to this AIDA dimmer switch. Although, it is rated for 600W incandescents, it is only 150W for LEDs and CFLs which the majority of us would have. Next is that it comes with no plate cover. Which is generally fine because the switch with this dimmer looks like a simple up/down light switch. So your own face plate should fit it fine. We had no issue with installing it and using our prior face plate with it. The final caveat is that at the lower light level settings, there seems to be a mini-cycle of up and down on the brightness. That is, it had trouble with keeping the same low level setting. Since for our needs, we did not have or wish the room to be that dark, the switch worked fine with our level of comfortable ambient light. Overall, if you keep the three caveats in mind, this dimmer switch worked well for us.",

        "text": "I was able to replace an on/off toggle with this dimmer toggle switch without the need of getting a new face plate. Switch went into a multi gang box the rest of the switches in the box are toggle switch and it is more difficult to get customized faceplate where there is a decora style switch(as with most dimmer) mixed in the middle of a bunch of toggle switches. This toggle style dimmer allow me to keep the faceplate and not have to change out all the other switches to decora style switch just so I can have a dimmer in the middle. The dimmer switch is shallow and doesn't take up much room in a crowded electrical box. Adjustment works well, just set the min lighting setting for the load and replace the faceplate. Slider adjustment independent of the on/off toggle allows a set and forget for brightness level so you can always just set the brightness to what you normally want and just use the toggle to turn on an off. The option to adjust brightness is still readily available.",

        "text": "I own a handyman service, so end up installing lots of light fixtures and also dimmer switches. This AIDA branded dimmer is very much a standard LED-compatible dimmer. It's a bit more narrow than most, which isn't a bad thing. As usual it can function as a 3-way switch, if you need that capability. As noted in some other reviews the switch makes a slight audible click when switched, which I consider a plus, as I prefer switches with the tactile feedback that's associated with the click. So, this is very much a standard LED compatible dimmer. The Amazon price for 1 is a couple of dollars cheaper than my local sources. To me the big news here is the pricing on larger quantities. At the time this review was written a pack of 4 runs $51 or $12.75 per dimmer. A pack of 10 is just $10.30 each.",

Thankfully the dimmer is there next to the switch. Keep in mind that when using this in a hallway with two controlling switches, only the one with the dimmer will turn the lights on to the setting you have it at. The other switch will turn the lights on full brightness. It's not really a big deal, but would be nice if it kept it on the same brightness the dimmer switch is set to.",

What I do not like ~ (no deal breakers here) • At least with my LED lighting, there is a very noticeable delay between flipping the switch and the lights coming on. If I am in a rush, I have already stepped into the room before the lights have come on. • I am still messing with the \"minimum dimmer\" function ~ may be due to having LEDs and them drawing so little power ~ troubleshooting suggestion from instructions suggest I up the wattage.",
