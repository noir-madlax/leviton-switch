        "text": "So I like the fact that the design does have 1 input and 3 outputs making it easier to install (making sure, of course, your breaker can handle all three and your local code doesn't warn you off from this). What I didn't like about it, was the switching action itself. Turning each switch off was normal and decently quiet. Turning each switch on was a bit more of a mechanical hassle and noisier. I cycle each one multiple times prior to installing to see if it was just a manufacturing issue. For me testing, I did hook up lights to each output and they all worked just fine and there was no draw through the switch when all three were activated. I gave it 5 stars, but really wanted to give it 4 due to the mechanics of the switch and not testing longevity of the switch over a longer period of time to see if the unit will fail or short out, etc.",

        "text": "The switch(es) function like you would expect. Install was easy with the clamp style terminals. And the UL listing provides some extra piece of mind. Having a triple rocker in a single gang allows me to add other interesting components to my box, such as a nightlight and proximity sensor. The only thing I think could be improved is the feel of the rockers. There is a bit of play in the rocker before you get to the forceful part of the activation. The inconsistent feel from off to on makes it feel a bit cheap. None of my other rocker style switches exhibit this behavior, so it is quite noticeable. But, let's be honest, for the price of three separate switches and the space savings, this AIDA triple rocker is a pretty good value.",
