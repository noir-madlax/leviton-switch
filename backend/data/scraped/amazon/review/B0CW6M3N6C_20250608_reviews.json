        "text": "We have various dimmer switches in each of the bedrooms in our house. I prefer this style with the smaller style slider off to the side instead of the larger ones that we have in some of our other bedrooms. It allows for the switch to look more like just a normal switch but with the added functionality of a dimmer. These arn't hard to install just follow the directions and make sure you wire them correctly. Typically all you need is a screw driver and maybe a wire stripper/cutter tool. They are a standard size compared to other dimmers so you may just have to move or push some of the wiring around inside the gang box.",

        "text": "I really like the design of this dimmer - instead of focusing on a huge rocker switch like others on the market with a small dimmer slider, this unit decided that the dimmer slider should be larger which makes it way more functional. The rocker switch is still plenty large so no loss of functionality there. Love things that are both functional and have good form, and this meets both. Nice to see manufacturers focusing on LED specific dimmers, instead of repurposing incandescent ones and making them LED compatible. I don't need a 600W LED dimmer (which most incandescent ones support), so this one is perfectly sized for LED use. I also like that unlike most dimmers on the market, this one does not come with pigtails off the unit. It is a standard switch with three screws (so it can be used for both 2 way and 3 way situations), and a ground pigtail. A nice touch is a QR code label on the unit for installation instructions in case you lose the included paper copy (they probably could save a few trees and not bother with the paper copy).",

The dimmer slider is smooth although a bit harder to move. The advantage of that is that it doesn’t sim accidentally. The paddle has a snap to it. An additional feature is the ability to use this in a 3-way application which is how I installed it.",

There are calibration settings of you need to limit how dim your bulbs can go. It is relatively compact and has UL approval. The instructions are clear and fairly extensive. It will work in a 2-way or 3-way set up. The dimmer slider is good sized and easy to use.",

I had a dimmable light fixture installed in my bedroom a while back, but it was still being used on the standard rocker switch, so I finally got around to changing that. This was simple to install, and looks great in place of the old rocker, nice clean look,more modern. It operates smoothly, and at full power, the light fixture seems just as bright. It's so nice to be able to dim the lights to a more comfortable level.",

        "text": "I spent some time doing lab testing of this switch, and I have to say that I'm impressed thus far. This LED-compatible dimmer handles most of the issues that you commonly run into during a normal installation. The install itself is fairly straightforward, supporting either single switch or three-way installs. I did notice that the switch seemed to limit (even on high) the current the lights could take. Testing with a bulb at 11.7W, with the switch in place I couldn't get it over 11.1W, so there was some dimming of the lights involved, even with the dimmer slide at maximum. One common problem with LED bulbs is the lower dimming range, and this one was no exception -- the bulbs turned off completely at a low dim level. Using the easy procedure to reset the dimmer low range, fixed this, though. (I could not get the high range to go any higher, though.) The burst feature resolves another common problem, when using different LED bulbs on a circuit, they can be slow to start up if the dimmer is low. This forces full power for a very short time to activate all bulbs, and then it trims the brightness for you. If you are unhappy with your current dimmer, then I'm pretty sure you're going to like this one.",

        "text": "This switch feels well made-- the plastic does not feel cheap or brittle, the switch provides some resistance and a positive \"click\", the slider is easy to use, and it dims my LED bulbs smoothly with no flickering or buzzing. In addition, I am a fan of the wire connections-- it's a combo backstab and clamp type style. That is, you insert the straight stripped wire, then tighten the screw to clamp it in. No trying to bend the wire around a screw and keep it there as you tighten it. This is quick, easy, and takes no skill. I love it. Do note that this can only power 150W worth of load-- so it's good for a few LED lights or a couple incandescent lights, but not a row of 40 lights in your open floor plan. Also, my LED lights did require me to adjust the low end cut off using the calibration button. It took about 20 seconds and now when I dim all the way with the slider, the power to the LED bulbs stops before the LED lights go out or super dim. Easy adjustment, worked well. If you can live with the 150W maximum power (that is, don't overload this switch), then this is perfect. Well made, looks good, easy to use, easy to install, no buzzin will dimming, no flickering of LED lights. Easy 5 stars.",

I didn't realize (more like didn't pay attention when ordering) exactly how BRIGHT the new LED vanity light was going to be. So, after enduring sunburn for a few weeks, something had to change. I picked this up and installed it quickly - pretty much like any other switch if you are handy at electrical installation. You'll need the standard 'decorator' or 'decor' wall plate for the opening if you stared with a standard toggle switch. The slider stays at about 30%-40% and that seems to be about the perfect brightness. Two things I liked better about this one compared to some other manufacturers. First, the slider is maintained and independent from the on/off function. Basically, we have it set at a certain brightness and never touch that part - only the on/off now. Second, I like that the slider is a little larger than other ones I've seen. I don't care for the dinky sliders on some other brands. This one is quite a bit larger and much easier to use.",

        "text": "I'm a general contractor by trade, and I put a lot of this type of stuff in. Usually switches will have a screw to attach a safety ground. This switch instead has a green, stranded lead attached, and an orange wire nut to join them. It's at least a real wire nut, with metal inside it, but I prefer to have the screw. It has 2 spots for back-wiring on each terminal, big enough to fit 12ga wire into, which is nice, a black screw for the common, and clearly marked (in raised plastic) for single pole and 3 way. It only sticks back into the work box about 1 1/8 inch, which leaves plenty of room for wiring behind it, and is about as wide as a typical GFI, so a little tight side to side. As far as the visible and functional aspects, it fits nicely in a decora cover plate, and looks normal. The dimmer slide is smooth and easy to operate. The rocker switch itself seems to have a pretty serious spring driving it, and takes a little more effort to push , and makes a louder 'click' than a lot of other switches I've installed. Maybe these would both diminish over time, with use, and it isn't horribly loud, just a little louder than normal.",

        "text": "Having had many years trying to integrate LED lighting with non-flickering dimmer switches, this new version of Pass and Seymour LED dimmer was a real pleasure to experience. We’ve had a chronic problem with a new set of bathroom LED lights, that flickered with the dimmer switches installed from Pass and Seymour. After trying two other brands with the same dilemma, I’d pretty much given up until this switch came along. Evidently it is of new design and the company has figured out the proper way to engineer the switch for modern LED fixtures. Installation was simple and the minimum-maximum functionality allowed lighting to be tailored for our particular environment. I’ve been pretty disappointed in the past but can’t say enough about this newly designed dimmer switch from Pass and Seymour.",

        "text": "This Radiant Dimmer is performing admirably with my LED recessed lights. I discovered the need for a new dimmer with adjustable minimum settings to effectively control my 4 recessed LED can lights. Setting up this dimmer in single-pole mode was a breeze. I noticed that the additional terminal used in 3-way mode was covered with a sticker, which was unnecessary for my installation but may interest others. Installation involves inserting 14 or 12 gauge wire through one or two of the holes in the back and then tightening the screw at the side. I was somewhat surprised to find a stranded ground wire permanently attached to the metal housing without a ground screw terminal, as I had Wago push-wire connectors in the box already. The switch included a traditional wire nut in the box for this connection so this was a minor inconvenience in an otherwise swift installation process. The instructions for adjusting the minimum/maximum levels are written step-by-step, but the gist is to turn on the light, set the slider to min/max, push and hold the tiny button on the side of the switch's face, and then adjust the slider to the desired lowest/highest level before releasing the calibration button. There are also other settings related to \"burst mode\" and \"soft start\" turn-on methods, along with additional instructions provided. This switch does have a slightly raised profile compared to the one I'm replacing, and adjusting it by curling the metal bits around the switch doesn't seem to be easy. Nevertheless, I am satisfied with this dimmer from Pass & Seymour/Legrand, and it is functioning well for my needs.",

        "text": "This dimmer has turned out to be the ideal match for our LED ceiling lights. Unlike our old dimmer, this unit is very smooth from dark to bright, free of any visible flickering. It also has no trouble powering on the lights at their lowest level, whereas our previous dimmer had to be turned up half way before the fixtures produced any light. Installation was straightforward, with both side- and back-clamped wiring methods supported. The dimmer works perfectly in a 3-way setup, and my remote switch's illuminated paddle still lights up as before. The unit did well for me with its default settings, but you can customize min/max brightness, enable a slight fade-to-on effect, and adjust burst mode (for LEDs that need it). Just be sure to hold onto the instructions, as the options are set using a variety of switch/slider/button combinations. Overall, I'm very happy with this dimmer's build quality and performance. It's worth noting, however, that a wall plate isn't included, so plan on buying a matching Radiant plate for the best, screwless/flush look. Standard decorator plates will also fit, but the dimmer's rectangular face may protrude somewhat from thin or low-profile ones.",

        "text": "Pretty hefty unit. A bit deeper than the GE 3-way dimmer it replaced, so make sure you’ve got enough depth in your box. It’s definitely better made than then far more delicate GE. Nice adjustment range including high and low, and it’s easy to set. Instructions very thorough. Works great without buzzing or flicker. I was a bit worried that the skinnier-than-usual toggle would look strange compared to the size of an adjacent full-size on-off toggle, but it looks fine once installed. It’s relatively pricey but the build quality and high/low settings do set it apart.",

        "text": "Since my significant other will only tolerate dimmable light sources, I've installed dimmer switches on every light in our house. I've tried 3-4 styles and these rocker with slider switches are my favorite, both in looks and usage. The look is very modern and clean, especially with this included wall plate. I love the color options but since I've already started with some other white switches I stayed with white. The usage is also very straight forward, with an on/off rocker that feels solid and dimmer slider on the side. On the technical side, the 150W dimmer seems to handle LED bulb dimming well with no flickering, something that can happen depending on how many bulbs you're dimming and also the bulbs themselves. This switch did well with the color changing LED smart bulb I have in the lamp that it controls. It should have enough capabilities to handle most LEDs without flickering.",

My husband is a pretty handy guy and has done a fair amount of DIY electrical work, this switch was a little challenging to install. I think mostly due to the fact that we were going from traditional switches to these rocker switches. It's not a lot of space to work with. Once installed they worked perfectly. You do have to make sure you are using dimming bulbs. I plan to buy more and install them around my house!",
