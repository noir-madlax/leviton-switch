I bought three and one constantly fully freezes so even pressing the button doesn’t work, causing me to have to pull the air gap and reset the switch almost daily. There was a time where an update was pushed that crashed all the switches permanently too. I had no light in three rooms for week when this happened while I waited for replacements. Overall, if I was renovating again, I’d go with another switch.",

        "text": "As a disabled engineer I bought several of these to make my life easier at home. They work, but have a few snags that I would think GE had solved by now, it's 2025! I chose the version that does not require a neutral wire because my house is older. I got them all working, but had the following problems along the way. 1. These don't work with generic (Walmart) LED bulbs unless you install the bulb adapter they supply. You only need 1 adapter per switch, even if the lamp has multiple bulbs. BUT, what do you do for lights that don't have a traditional bulb - you have to call GE and get a \"fixture adapter.\" Really? 2. If you install these in a multi switch outlet (with 2 or 3 or 4 switches behind 1 cover), the cover will have a gap behind it. Very annoying. These switches are thick and a generic cover won't sit flat against the wall, and GE does not sell 2 or 3 or 4 switch covers, only singles! I had to research \"deep switch covers\" and buy several online. Or recess the GE switch into the wall a bit. 3. Mine would NOT work with stainless steel switch covers, which I have in my kitchen. It seems a metal cover blocks the WiFi. So, I had to replace the SS covers with plastic. No warning about this in the manual. 4. I use one of the non-dimming versions to switch a ceiling fan that draws well below the 5 amp limit (as stated by GE). They last about 1 year, then burn out. They get hot and smell like burning plastic. Two have failed this way! 5. They never work the first time you add them to the phone app. You must delete the switch and start over in the app. The 2nd time you add them, they work. Confusing. 6. Good luck getting them to work on a 3-way circuit (2 switches on opposite sides of the room controlling 1 light). GE says it will work, but you have to replace both old switches with these WiFi switches. Neither I or my electrician got it to work. Finally I converted the 3-way circuit to a simple 2-way by bypassing 1 switch and installing just 1 of these WiFi switches. Overall, I give these a 2 out of 5 stars. They work, but need much improvement.",

        "text": "Purchased 4 of these switches for my ceiling lights. 3 bedrooms. No neutral wires as advertised, great. But.... I wish the Wi-Fi could stay connected for a lengthier period. After 2 months of operation. Numerous of network setting tweaks and tests. Nothing can keep these switches from disconnecting. They don't usually drop all at once. But sometimes it does. Because of Wi-Fi drops daily, or sometimes every other few days. The longest it stay connected was 6 days. Just shine of a full week. Which prevented the Google Home to communicate with it quite often. When it stays connected then it is great. But the short lived smart home experience fades away rather quickly. It can provides so much convenient to my household. Only if it could stay connected. So far, the result is a mixed bag. Giving it 3 stars because the GE App can still switch on/off over bluetooth the phone app with a button consistently (not over WiFi). Meaning I do have a remote switch on my phone. With this old house. Having any convenience is better than none. I'm considering it a consolation prize. PRO: *Easy installation. *No neutral wires is required. *Dimming works great *Light effect fade away to off. Fancy! *GE App works for the most part over bluetooth. CON: *Constant WiFi drop / disconnect *No Google Home voice control or any button commands due to the unstable connection form these switches. *No new firmware support or update over its WiFi connection issues. Shameful. *2.4hz module cost WiFi interference. *Bulky build. Small size conjunction box will not fit.",

        "text": "First I got this dimmer style and had the same problem the non-dimmer. I got the other one thinking the dimmer was the problem with the light type. I got this for a hardwired light so the adaptor wasn't an option. I got the app to see the switch. When it tried finding the network it didn't see it 5 out of the 6 attempts. When it finally saw the network the app refused to connect. (I have multiple bulbs and two outlets working on app already.) The last time it tried connecting to the network the switch just stopped working. It still feeds power to the light, it's just unswitched, constant power running to the light. The light ring doesn't light up and the air-gap and a circuit breaker reset doesn't do anything. The app won't recognize it anymore. Seems like the cync switches are garbage. Must be why Lowe's stopped carrying them in-store and aren't even doing a ship-to-store.",

        "text": "Update: While I was originally impressed with these switches, that is not the case after they've been in use for a couple months. They stopped working with Alexa after about a month, and now they lost their WiFi connections and will not reestablish the connection no matter what has been tried. They still work as manual switches, but nothing smart about them. If you do a search you will see that others started seeing the same problems at the start of 2025. I am holding out for a firmware update, but I won't wait long before I ditch these. Original review: There are not a lot of choices for smart switches when a common wire is not available in the switch box. This is the best one available. I used them for three way switch wiring (two switches for one light source). Works great. One tip that's not clear in the documentation: put each switch in a common group when you're setting them up in the Cync app, then reference that group when you're turning the lights on and off. This is especially important for dimmable lights.",

        "text": "This thing is Boss. Older home here, only had a hot in and line out to our dining room lights and was sad there weren’t too many options for a smart switch that did not need a neutral line. I also thought at first glance it was weird looking since it doesn’t look like any other light switch on the market - but this thing is Boss! (I’m bringing that word back) Super easy install, I like how it looks, at first it wasn’t dimming and I was worried my old chandelier wouldn’t work with it (since they send a weird light bulb base adapter thing (capacitor? resistor?) they encourage you to use but the thing is huge and wasn’t going to work for me) but once I downloaded the GE Cync app it worked like a charm and easily connected to my Google home account or with Alexa. Very pleased and will likely need more of these as I renovate about the house. Video includes audio of my daughter fake crying and my dog drinking water, and I couldn’t show it working with voice commands but it works great.",

Installed onto incandescent lights in a ceiling fan device and it works just fine. But there's one important flaw. Once wired in, the switch emits a very quiet and very high pitched whine. If you have background white noise or are over the age of 50, you probably won't notice this. However this becomes noticeable when installed in a bedroom at night when it's very quiet and you're trying to go to sleep. Can still sleep through it, but it's annoying, fixing this issue would give 5 stars.",

And my lights had that much voltage but it still didn’t work Customer support said I have to use the adapter, but the description and packaging said I wouldn’t have to use the adapter if I met that voltage requirement. The reason this is an issue is because of 6 lights that are all small light bulbs. The adapter is for a big light bulb so I couldn’t use it",

We gave up trying to use it as a “smart” system, now they are just very expensive on off switches. The waffer lights will just random come on, sometimes in the middle of the night. Lights constantly blinking randomly. If you have 2 switches right next to each other, even if you go through the setup and connect them to the correct lights it’ll turn on every Cync light in the room, so now we have to switch out Cync dimmers with regular dimmer switches because this system should never have been sold to customers. GE should be ashamed. Thousands wasted on a system that is worse than old fashioned lights and dimmers. This may be one of the worst products I’ve ever purchased. Stay away unless you want nothing but problems.",

It's a first-world problem, but it's very irritating. This totally fits the bill. Alexa integration is great. Setup is slightly confusing but isn't painful. The red flag: many have reported quality issues with this device. My device failed within days of installation. I ordered another one and that one has been working fine for a month. Will update if the replacement fails. I wouldn't normally even bother, but there aren't very many no-neutral smart dimmers, and rewiring the switch for neutral is just not feasible here. My advice: if you want to give this a try, SERIOUSLY, order double and return the broken ones. UPDATE: after two months, the replacement unit has the SAME SYMPTOMS. This device has SEVERE quality problems with its integration. STAY AWAY.",
