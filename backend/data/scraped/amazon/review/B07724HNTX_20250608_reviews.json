        "text": "I've bought 12 TP-Link smart light switches over the past 3-4 years. Two weeks ago, one just stopped working. I figured, okay, stuff happens. But then—boom—another one dies the following week. The day after that? A third one goes out. That’s three failures in under two weeks. Out of curiosity, I checked TP-Link’s website. Surprise, surprise: the warranty is only 1–2 years. Guess what? All three failed right after the warranty expired. These things aren’t defective — they’re engineered to fail once you’re no longer covered. That’s not a coincidence. That’s a planned-obsolescence scam. These smart switches are not “smart”—they’re a stupid waste of money. Regular light switches last 10–20 years, while these overpriced plastic toys can’t even last two. DO NOT BUY these switches. I don’t care how fancy the app is or what brand it is — TP-Link or otherwise. If it needs replacing every couple of years, it’s trash. Stick with old-school switches. They’re cheap, reliable, and they don’t leave you in the dark — literally.",

I was unable to use one of the switches because of the electrical run. The switch works, but now one of the switches does not match the others. The second pair I purchased for the foyer. This set could not find the signal, even though other switches in the same box connected fine. It will flash orange and green but not set up. Sometimes the foyer light will come on, on its own. Sometimes the switch won't work manually. Come prepared with an extra level of patience to deal with this set up. I still haven't been able to get it to operate as expected.",

        "text": "First issue, had these been labeled as \"frequently returned\" when I purchased them like they are now, I wouldn't have. This message didn't appear for me until after I had and installed them then proceeded to waste time discovering the quirks for myself. The switches themselves work well enough, however the entire reason I purchased these is for compatibility with my Home Assistant based smart home. These will not work without using the KASA or other cloud based apps and what I want is something compatible with my locally hosted Home Assistant. Since I have other KASA products, I mistakenly purchased these thinking they were Matter compatible, but they are not. All my other KASA switches use Matter so it was an easy mistake to make. Problem two is they don't reliably report their status to the KASA app which defeats the purpose of using the app in the first place. This is a problem since I don't want multiple cloud based apps that don't mingle controlling devices for my smart home. This means everything must be separate or I have to stay in one ecosystem and can't take advantage of the best products from whoever makes them. The positives: the installation was easy and I like the touch style switches. I like the halo when the switch is off and how they match other switches in the house. I also like that regardless of which switch was used to control the light, they both look the same. Two switches in different positions to control the same light / device is one of my annoyances with a 3-way light setup using typical north American lever switches.",

        "text": "This product worked perfectly, once it was installed correctly! Connecting this to the Neutral is key and making sure you identify the Neutral is imperative. When I opened up the electrical box that had 3 total switches, I only opened up the far left box. That was the one I was replacing with this product. I saw a gray wire, which can sometimes represent the Neutral, so I connected the white wire from this Kasa switch to that gray wire. When I flipped the breaker on, it just tripped immediately. Upon further review, I read that sometimes, the Neutrals are just sort of placed in the back of the electrical box...out of the way. So I then took off the remaining 2 light switches and sure enough, tucked away in the back right were white wires...all twisted together with the wire nut. I found the neturals! After some maneuvering, I connected the Kasa white neutral to the neutrals in the box...flipped the breaker and everything worked. Setup was a breeze and I'm really loving the \"vacation\" feature to make it seem like we're home when we're not. Any deterrence is good deterrence! And to confirm, I only swapped out ONE of the three-way switches. I still have traditional toggle on the other side of the garage where we installed this. So no need to install BOTH switches for one 3-way switch light. Highly recommend and I may now have to swap out more smart switches in the house!",

I have over 20 of these installed in my house and have been totally trouble free since the spring of 2022. I have had them tied to google home and Alexa through multiple accounts it has been totally seamless. However, If I am being critical I would point out the mechanical side of the switch feels somewhat cheap and doesn't not give a satisfying click when pressed. Also the switch is quite bulky on the backside make sure you have plenty of space in your switch boxes, making room for this extra bulk is the most time consuming and tedious part of the install if your boxes are already crowded",

Despite both products being from the same brand, the Kasa app is consistently laggy, slow, and unreliable. Even with a strong network connection, the app struggles to respond, making smart home control frustrating. The biggest issue is connectivity. The Deco A5400 mesh system itself has been unstable, frequently dropping connections or failing to properly integrate with Kasa devices. I’ve tried every troubleshooting method—resetting, repositioning nodes, firmware updates—but nothing has provided a long-term fix. To make matters worse, Google Home integration is unreliable at best, with devices often appearing offline or responding inconsistently to voice commands. For a smart home ecosystem, reliability is crucial, and TP-Link has not delivered. If you’re looking for a seamless smart switch and mesh WiFi combination, I’d strongly recommend looking at other brands.",

However, largest problem is that the switch housing prevents it from being installed in standard 4\" steel electrical boxes. So, why is this a problem? If you have a steel electrical box (common in basements and garages) the steel cover mounting screws are covered by the switch housing and the housing is too long to fit inside the box. The 4\" box has to be removed and a larger box installed. Not impossible, but unnecessary if tp-link had reduced the plastic flange so it fits inside standard electrical boxes.",

I am finally able to write a follow up after having the 3-way wifi setup installed in multiple rooms since fall of 2021. Since then, 2 different 3 way switches (2 out of 4 in the pairs) have gone into constant on/off mode. The switch turns itself on and off continually and all the lights its connected to on and off. This is happening RAPIDLY -- maybe 2 on/off cycles every second! No amount of Restarts or Resets of the switch resolve the issue. All devices have the latest firmware. Granted, the warranty is only 2 years for these devices and they tend to crap out on the dot every 3 years, but is having to replace 1 of the 2 switches every 3 years worth it considering a traditional 3-way switch works until the rest of time?",

        "text": "I’ve had these switches installed on my home for about 2 years now. They’ve been great! Installation was easy and the integration with the Kasa app is seamless. At random times they disconnect from my internet for some reason, but it has only happened a handful of times. Overall, pretty satisfied and would buy again.",
