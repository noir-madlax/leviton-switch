        "text": "I used these switches to replace a couple of ceiling fan controllers which I no longer needed. These are single pole Decora paddle switches that have the press-in quick connectors. The installation was very simple, as I only had to press the stripped AC wires into the quick connect holes in the switches. The ground wire still needs to be screwed in, however. I like the UL listing, which means they have passed rigorous testing for safety. What I don’t like is the cheap feeling toggle feel of the switches. The off action, in particular, has this loud thunk sound instead of that satisfying click of a good quality switch. For my use, I can get past that since they will always be in the on position anyway since the fans now are operated by a remote controller. What I’m not sure I can get past is there is a noticeable gap at the top of the switch that my other switches do not have. Overall, I think these switches can be so much better if attention was paid to tolerances and switch feel. For the asking price, I would just go to the big box stores and purchase switches there and save money as well.",
