        "text": "This little dimmer button is fun. It's biggest problem is making itself know to those who aren't looking for it. It is simply a touch dimmer for 12v, max 36 watt, LED lights. Touch it and it comes on. Hold your touch and it dims up or down, depending on it dimmoing state. If you stop dimming at a point of brightness that you like and turn the light off by touching the button, it will return to that level when you touch the button and turn it back on. It is very small and compact and doesn't cause flicker (when used with the right power supply and lights) and is silent. If you are looking for an unobtrusive small dimmer, this could be your best bet. The photo above shows the switch mounted in a corner oak piece I made to dim under the under-counter lights.",

        "text": "I still like these the best. I have used these for illuminating my custom built power supplies to controlling 12v 1.5 amp fans and more. For two of my projects I had to cut off the heat shrink wrapper (its bulky and fairly useless and replace the wires with highly flexible wires (20 and 22 ga). the one I had to do this because the +out wire was actually disconnected upon arrival which I guess most people would return as a \"reject\" but I had to re wire it anyway because the wires they provide are very very stiff and hard to route so, big deal I just replaced them. But the electronics in this \"micro\" switch is fantastic and user friendly. I plan on using them in other designs too. I highly recommend these. Please see my video before trying to mount. UPDATE: NOW I jinxed myself singing praise for these but the very next one I used wouldnt shut off. It was on all the time. I could adjust the PWM but it wouldnt shut off. As soon as I powered up it was on and stayed on until I cut power. Thats a bummer. The led worked, everything worked I just didnt have the capability ot turn it on/off with the button. O well I have more but its frustrating to finalize ur project and find such a fundamental flaw. O well. Rip it apart again. REVISED: 5 TO 2 STAR RATING: I ordered a three pack and all therr blew out (not literally) they just stopped working properly. I know for a fact that these can't handle 2 amps let alone 3. I sent them back. I guess if ur using 350mA LEDs these work .. that's what I initially was using them for but as soon as I tried pushin 650mA (and 2 strings of 650mA LEDs) they just dont work .u can easily tell they r shot because the only thing they do I lit up. NO PWM , NO ON/OFF NOTHING. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED 😞",

        "text": "I have used numerous of these switches in various projects, both my own and for clients. Was hestitant at first despite from of the reviews. Long short, they work great if you know what you are doing (basic electrical skills and such). I have purchased and installed many of these touch activated switches, from latching (no LED) to latching with LED always on, to stepless dimming (LED on when light on). All have worked from the start and continue to work perfectly. Really great switches. Note that these switches do not interrupt the red (positive) wires as in most mechanical toggle switches, but instead interrupt the black to green connection (negative); in other words, the black and green wire CANNOT share a common ground but must instead remain on separate, isolated circuits (green to battery negative, black to light negative). This is exactly as shown in their installation instructions. However, I tried to take a shortcut with this light as I was swapping out an older, mechanical toggle switch and had wired the light so that its black/negative ground wire was connected to chassis ground, which is also ultimately connected back to my \"house\" battery ground in my vehicle. The touch switch didn't operate under these conditions (unlike most 12V DC mechanical toggle switches). I have since disconnected the light's ground wire from its connection with chassis ground and connected it directly to the black wire of the touch switch, and viola! All the switches I have utilized work perfectly! I've included the wiring schematic I received.",

There are 4 wires coming off the switch. #1-Black wire- goes to battery ground, #2 red wire goes to ignition wire, not battery. #3 red wire goes to lights, #4 yellow wire goes to lights ground wire or wires. It is not an on-off switch. it is only a dimmer switch. On - off requires key on to turn on, and key off to turn off. Hope this helps everyone.",

        "text": "My wife's lighted makeup mirror came with a similar lit button, but the dimmer circuitry was was on a separate board and the mirror was stuck on the dimmest setting. So something had failed either in the button or dimmer. It was only two years old, but I was not getting much traction from the vendor. And I can understand that, given the warranty is probably over. But still, it was one of the higher priced mirrors in this category and I would have expected more than two years before seeing a failure. Anyway, the layout was a power cord to an internal 12v power supply wired to a dimmer board that had wires to the button and to the LEDs surrounding the light. I ripped out the button and dimmer board and replaced them both with this single button that had the dimmer circuitry built in. From the button I connected two wires to the power supply and the other two wires to the LEDs. It worked perfectly. It performed exactly the same functions as the original mirror and the button was the exact same diameter with the exact same outer spring clips and the exact same blue light within the button. This saved a bundle of money over replacing the mirror. However, it did not contain wire diagram for the button. I had to go back to the button listing on Amazon and print out the wire color code diagram from there. Not a big deal, but for anyone ordering this, you might as well print that out at the same time you order it. And you will probably want a soldering iron to make the connections secure. I also dabbed a little hot-melt glue on the back side of the button to give it a really solid feel. The old button had the same treatment from the vendor. So I was just following their protocol. In the attached pictures, the first shows the old components as they were originally in the mirror base. The second shows my initial test of connecting the new button. This is just before pulling the old button out of the fixture and inserting the new one in its place. So far no failure, no fire, no fuss. My wife is super happy to have the bright setting back.",
