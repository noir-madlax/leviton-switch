Easy to install. The switch works. Has a green indicator light so you can find it in the dark. I bought 2 of them and they both really work good. A must have if your light is too bright like mine was. Gives me control of my light brightness. Can't beat the price. Do not notice any delay when using it. Connected to my wires without any issues.",

        "text": "Please Note: This review is of the Cloudy Bay Smart Dimmer Switches shown in the photos. This listing on Amazon has apparently been updated by the seller to reflect a different Cloudy Bay Switch that I have no experience with but if you review their entire listing you will still see this version referenced in photos and the product comparison chart. Purchased 8 (4 -2 packs) of the switches shown in the picture for my home remodel and after only a few months, 4 of the 8 switches have either failed completely or exhibited odd/glitchy behavior that could not be corrected. I replaced 2 with identical units (on my dime) trying to give the product the benefit of the doubt thinking I may have just received a couple duds but now that 2 more have acted up I have decided to remove all of them for safety concerns and replace them with TP Link products that I have had ZERO problems with in the past. Perhaps this is why Cloudy Bay no longer has this switch available in the listing but this is where my order history links so this is where I am leaving this review. The lesson here folks, at least for me, is to remember the saying of Buy Once, Cry Once. I took a chance on a different Smart Dimmer Switch with Alexa Integration to try and save some money but the amount of time and money this experience has cost me was absolutely not worth it! I should've just paid the extra money for the switches I had a solid experience with and moved on. Now, to be fair, I have not reached out to Cloudy Bay to attempt warranty repair/replacement since I have NO desire to put their products back in my walls given the high failure rate. I'm sure I am past any warranty window so all I can do is post my experience here for others to see and let them decide if they want to take a chance with Cloudy Bay products or not. If the seller would like these switches returned for research please reach out to me with a shipping label and I will gladly send them back to you if it might help as they are of no use to me at this point and are heading to the landfill soon.",

At first moving the slide control down didn't dim the lights. Then I noticed a tiny dimming range control wheel on the right side of the switch. The dimmer range control is neither visible nor accessible after installing the switch cover plate. After adjusting the dimmer range control to allow the slide control to work, I installed the cover plates and all was good. There should be but there isn't any mention of the dimmer range control in the installation / operation manual that comes with the switch.",
