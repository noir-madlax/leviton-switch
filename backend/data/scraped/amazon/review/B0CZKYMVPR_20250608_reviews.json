        "text": "The receiver is kinda large and I had to rearrange some wires in the 3 switch box but it fit without a whole lot of hassle. I did get the two back pieces apart but it wasn't real easy. I think the trick is to put a flat screwdriver in the top end where the slot is and turn it - that will bend one of the pieces and make it so you can release the 4 locking tabs. I then decided to put it back together and use a removable adhesive strip instead of screws into the drywall. It's very light weight. The portable switch is easily removed and replaced from the wall mounted back plate. Works very well.",

I replaced an existing switch that was outside of the room with the \"box\" and it was fairly easy with the help of Internet (my set-up was a bit different than the instructions that do not cover two switches connected in the same electrical box). It worked right away, without the need to pair anything. I turned on the power and it just worked, which was a pleasant surprise. The only issue I'm facing is detaching the wall mount from the switch case. It's stuck together and if I try to use a tool to separate them, I can see the plastic bending. So I can't install the switch on the wall with the provided screws, I might have to use double-sided tape instead, unless the seller can send me both the wall mount and case separated. Let's see if they reply to my comment first. Overall, I like it. I thought about WiFi connected switches but how often do you really use that?...",

When the house was built, the bedroom light and the hallway light were wired together, meaning the hallway lights were powered through the bedroom light. To fix this, I removed the wall switch, connected the lights directly to the house wiring , and installed a wireless light switch receiver in the light junction box to control the lights. I installed the housing of the remote switch holder over the light switch JBox, I then added a remote switch in the hallway, allowing me to control each light separately. As shown in the video, the lights turn on instantly with minimal delay. It works perfectly!",

So that you could run them independently of the other lights in the bathroom, which all had a night light feature. Without a separate switch this messes up the night light option. So I chose to use this tree well wireless switch, as a way to place the exhaust fan and light on its own switch and circuit. It was super easy to install, however, there are interactions with electricity. So if you don't know what you're doing I would suggest that you get someone to assist you or have an electrician install this for you. The build quality seems pretty good, and the size matched up well with the in-wall switch. Overall the functionality seems to work great, there's very little delay in the process. Recommended for any time that you need to add a switch but you don't have access to running new lines in the walls. I purchased a second one of these so that I could add a antique light to my stairwell that has been updated with smart technology.",

        "text": "Used this remote light switch on a remodel in an old brick home (brick walls with plaster) where it is not easy to reroute or run new wiring. We reversed a door and the light switch was now on the wrong side. This Treewell switch saved a lot of money and time. Removed the old light switch, wired up the controller as per the simple instructions, installed the remote switch and done. No programming, no Wi-Fi needed. If you notice in the video, the old switch box is a shallow metal box. It was tight, but the controller was able to fit and get a cover plate on it nicely. Shut off power to the light switch and was complete in about 25 min, including mounting the remote switch.",

I installed in place of a switch that turns on a floodlight. Every time I turned on the power it would Immediately trip the circuit (15 amp) and 8 would have to try over and over until I gave up. I even hooked it up in reverse, but unfortunately, my circuit breaker couldn’t handle it.",

This is not the first wireless switch I have installed, and the TREEWELL offers good value. We installed this above a ceiling fan which has constant power, meaning we had to use the chains to turn it off and on. It is really nice to have a switch to be able to turn it on. Paring the switch to the receiver was very easy and it paired within seconds. 5 stars for the easy install, easy to follow instructions, and all around good product!",

        "text": "The thing you need to know before buying this switch remote and receiver is that the receiver requires four wires, which not every light switch box will have. It depends on how your lightswitch was installed. So, I recommend turning off the breaker and opening up the switch you want to move to check the wiring before ordering. Make sure there’s a cable with power coming in (live black wire and neutral white). This will power the receiver. If there are only two wires, then power is going to the fixture first, and the receiver won’t work. There also needs to be a cable with two wires going to the fixture. If there’s a third, red wire, you probably have a 3-way switch. Treewell does sell a receiver with two remotes for this situation (see my review of that below). I installed mine to move a switch for the light over our kitchen sink. The original switch was awkwardly placed behind where we keep our dish soap, etc. I put the new switch on the side of the cabinet above and to the right of the sink. It was great not to have to run wires or take up cabinet space with an electrical box. If you are moving a switch, you might want to go ahead and order a blank wall plate to match your box size and decor. At first, I thought it might feel wasteful to use a battery powered switch, but most ceiling fans have remotes now, so it’s not that unusual. I plan to install a garbage disposal, and I’m thinking about getting another one of these switches for that. Great product! ------------------------------------------------------------ Here's my review of the 3-way version (also 5 stars): Our new house has a Jack and Jill bathroom. The inspector said one of the light switches was too close to the bathtub. I was able to install this receiver where the old switch was and install the new remote switch on the other side of the doorway. The bathroom has pocket doors, so I wouldn’t have been able to move the switch to the new location without this product. I needed the version with 2 remotes because this is a 3-way switch. I couldn’t figure out the wiring to replace only 1 of the switches. So, I replaced them both. I capped off the extra wires going between the two switches (even though there’s no power going to those wires now). There was just enough room in the single-gang box to fit everything back inside. It’s nice that they include both bolts and screws/anchors to install the remote switch plates, allowing you to mount the plates to electrical boxes or the wall. I’m realizing now that I could also move the second switch inside the bathroom. I might do that later. This system is very flexible with lots of applications.",

        "text": "These switch relays allow you to put a light switch in a place where wiring is impractical. The light switch was very easy to install. The wireless transmitter has the wiring diagram right on it, so you don't even need the paper instructions, which is really convenient. The box is small enough to wedge in with the wires and has a physical switch right on it which was very helpful. The battery was easy to remove the plastic seal from to use. I'm very happy with the results so far.",
