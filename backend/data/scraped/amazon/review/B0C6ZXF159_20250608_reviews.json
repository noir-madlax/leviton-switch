        "text": "I bought a bunch of these switches (like 30) a little over a month ago. I recognize that’s a while, but I bought them for a new house and am just getting moved in. While I’ve installed about 20 and they’ve gone well so far, when I opened my last “4 pack” I was surprised to find that the switches were used! Granted, the box was completely sealed. 2 of the switches were some old style switch and all had seemingly been installed previously (look at the photos of the wire ends). Also, one of the old style had a yellow post-it note that says “bad” on it! How does this happen?!?! Amazon is refunding, but it still screws up my install process (and they couldn’t care less), plus I have to go through a reorder process to re-buy them at a now increased price! They say they’ll adjust the price for me if I contract them again after I receive the new product. What a pain… the process just seems to get worse and worse with Amazon. On the switches, I’d say they’re easy to install and setup and they integrate seamlessly with HomeKit. I have no complaints at all about the new/working products and would recommend them, but I might not recommend buying the 4 packs and possibly buy them from someone other than Amazon (maybe Meross directly). My rating: 5 stars for the working products, -5 stars for the 4 pack and 2 stars for Amazon support.",
