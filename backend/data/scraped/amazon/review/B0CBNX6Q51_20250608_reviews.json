        "text": "Our home has front porch lights and exterior up-lights on separate switches. These were both Intermatic timers, and one timer (unfortunately, with a non-removable battery) kept losing its program with every power outage. When I saw this two-pack on offer, I decided to replace both switches. Installation is well documented and straightforward and literally involved swapping out equivalent wires on the old timers onto the new. Even though I use Smart Life for all my home automation, I installed the Tapo app on my phone, purely so that I could upgrade the smart switches' firmware. This worked seamlessly. However, I was not able to get these devices to work with Smart Life (which is supposedly now compatible with the Matter standard). It recognized the devices and added them just fine. But when I attempted to program a scene, and got to the bit where you say which device feature you're trying to control, instead of seeing something like \"Switch\", I just got an entry with Chinese writing. Thinking this could have been a simple missing text issue, I selected this option, but it then gave an error when trying to save my scene. I don't know if this is an issue with these switches, or an issue with how Smart Life implements the Matter standard, so I didn't want to deduct a star in this review. It ended up not being a problem for me, as the only automation I want is a dusk-to-dawn schedule, never to be changed, and only to be overridden if I am at my front door and can just tap the switches directly. So, I programmed this in the Tapo app, which was super easy, and everything works as I need it to.",

I use apple home and they are easily and quickly added to HomeKit. I did install 3 switches at once and 2 were added then dropped off HomeKit. I readded them and they've been reliable since then. I've been using them for a couple months now and they've been great. They're replacing belkin wemo light switches. The wemo ones would power off and restart or look for updates almost nightly and when they do they'll power off for the 5-15 minutes every time. It was pretty dangerous on our kitchen light switch. These ones are a huge improvement.",

        "text": "The Tapo S505 smart switch is priced very competitively and is very easy to install. The instructions were clear, wiring it up was simple, and it connected to my Wi-Fi and app without any issues. For basic use, it’s a good value compared to more expensive brands. BUT there are two important problems you should know about: 1. HomeKit “Display As” Problem (Very Important for Apple Users): If you use Apple HomeKit with Matter, the Tapo S505 always shows up as a “Light” — even if you are using it to control something else, like a ceiling fan, a bathroom fan, or an outlet. There’s no way to change it. This means that in the Home app, it will always have a lightbulb icon and will behave like a light. If you tell Siri to “turn off all lights,” it could accidentally turn off your ceiling fan or outlet too, because HomeKit thinks it’s a light. Other brands let you change what the switch is (“Display As”) so HomeKit knows it’s a fan or outlet — but the Tapo switch does not. This is a major limitation, especially if you want your smart home to be organized properly. Despite being advertised as flexible, right now the firmware locks you into it being treated like a light, no matter what. 2. Low Power Support for Fans: This switch only supports up to 120 watts when controlling a ceiling fan. Many fans, especially ones that have built-in lights, can easily use more than 120 watts. If you hook up a more powerful fan, this switch might not work properly or could potentially be unsafe. Competing smart switches often handle much higher wattages. Bottom Line: If you just need a cheap smart switch for simple lighting and don’t care about HomeKit details, this is a good buy. But if you plan to use it for anything other than lights, or if you want proper HomeKit setup and reliability, you should look elsewhere.",

My only gripe is that for the fan switch the HomeKit recognizes it as a light switch, and there's no way to change it. Regardless, these are highly recommended, I have used Meross and other smart switch brands, but nothing comes close to reliability, speed of reactivity and durability as Tapo switches. I was actually surprised that these are cheaper than the Levitron non-smart switches and come with a lot more functionality, and are made a lot better.",

FYI: Add it to the Tapo App before adding it to Apple Home, then add it to HomeSeer. UPDATE: None of the TP-Link switches fit properly in screwless wall plates, except the one that comes with it. If you are going to install it in a multi-gang arrangement, the screwless wall plates will not sit flush with the wall, making for a very ugly installation. Their mounting ears are made of thick plastic, instead of thinner metal which is the cause of the problem.",

I have been using the Tapo app to control and schedule when the light turns on and off. Very easy to use. The physical switch is durable and works as expected. I added it to my Apple Home in February 2025. It didn’t connect right away, but a simple reset on the switch resolved the issue. I was able to set up an automation schedule. When someone in my household arrives home the light turns on and shuts off after 15 minutes. Set up to run between sunset and sunrise. I can ask Siri to turn it on and off using my iPhone or HomePod mini. The automation works seamlessly. Highly recommended!",

        "text": "I have installed about 40 of these (counting some S505D dimmer switches) in my home. These look good, work well, are easy to install. Out of the 40, only one arrived defective, and a dimmer switch broke because I was trying to operate a non-dimmable LED driver with it. Setup is somewhat slow, and the Tapo app does not support Matter setup. To work with Matter, they need to be set up via Google Home or whatever else you're using first. Then they can be added to the Tapo system. All of this is a bit slow if you're installing many switches at a time -- it would be nicer to be able to add all of them at once. The switches have minimal configurability. Other such products offer to turn off the relay (so it becomes a virtual switch that gets connected via software rules to do something). However, they do offer a \"delayed shutoff\" functionality, an \"auto-off timer\", and LED indicator config that includes a nice, automatic night mode that's great for bedrooms. Wifi connectivity is strong and reliable -- better than some SONOFF products I've tried, and no problems with DHCP leases running out like with many older products. Tip: I found that automations in the Tapo world run faster than via Google Home (which always goes via Cloud, even though you've got to have a local Matter server).",
