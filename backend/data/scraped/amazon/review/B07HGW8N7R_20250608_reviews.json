        "text": "I've bought 12 TP-Link smart light switches over the past 3-4 years. Two weeks ago, one just stopped working. I figured, okay, stuff happens. But then—boom—another one dies the following week. The day after that? A third one goes out. That’s three failures in under two weeks. Out of curiosity, I checked TP-Link’s website. Surprise, surprise: the warranty is only 1–2 years. Guess what? All three failed right after the warranty expired. These things aren’t defective — they’re engineered to fail once you’re no longer covered. That’s not a coincidence. That’s a planned-obsolescence scam. These smart switches are not “smart”—they’re a stupid waste of money. Regular light switches last 10–20 years, while these overpriced plastic toys can’t even last two. DO NOT BUY these switches. I don’t care how fancy the app is or what brand it is — TP-Link or otherwise. If it needs replacing every couple of years, it’s trash. Stick with old-school switches. They’re cheap, reliable, and they don’t leave you in the dark — literally.",

        "text": "These switches worked well for a few years after purchase. I liked the simplicity of install and the fact that no hub was required so installed many of them throughout our house. ~3 years later, all of the switches are failing one by one. They fail in a mode that just switches on and off repeatedly meaning I can’t just fix it later and replace the switch when it’s convenient, unless I’m ok with a light (or worse depending on the load controlled) flashing incessantly on and off and the sound of a relay clicking every second. TP link provided no support when contacted the first few times, just provided boilerplate troubleshooting before they said it can’t be fixed, and told me they’re out of warranty (it’s only 2 years so true but irritating) so I just need to replace them. I’m now proactively ripping all of these out of my house, giving away or disposing of the uninstalled extras, and will go with a more reliable brand next time. Sometimes the easy solution is definitely the wrong one, and this has tainted TP-Link’s reputation for me and will avoid them in the future.",

Did a quick web search, and it seems to be a common problem with this product. Basically, it suddenly stops working, and light stays on, even though I hear clicking sound from the switch, and also the indicator light turns on and off. It's just that the internal switch is defective and stops working. I had a spare; so, I replaced it with the spare, and it worked right away. It was good while it lasted, and the price is cheap, but lifetime of 1.5 years? I'm not sure I want to deal with electrical wiring so often. The product is definitely not durable. Luckily the product is under warranty of 2 years. Let's see how good their support is.",

        "text": "The Kasa Smart Light Switch (HS200P3) is one of those small upgrades that makes a huge difference. After moving into our new home from a place where we had these installed, I didn’t even think twice—I ordered a couple 3-pack right away. These switches are that good. Once you’ve lived with smart switches like this, it’s genuinely hard to go back to flipping lights on and off manually. They integrate beautifully with Alexa, making it easy to control your lights with a simple voice command. Whether I’m settling in to watch a movie or getting ready for bed, not having to get up to hit a switch is a luxury I didn’t know I needed—until I had it. While these don’t have dimming capabilities, they still deliver a top-tier smart home experience with reliable performance, remote access through the Kasa app, scheduling, and seamless voice control. And honestly, for most rooms, just having on/off control from anywhere is a total win. Super easy to install (as long as you have a neutral wire), and they look sleek on the wall. If you’re starting or expanding your smart home setup, this is one of the best bang-for-your-buck upgrades out there.",

Despite both products being from the same brand, the Kasa app is consistently laggy, slow, and unreliable. Even with a strong network connection, the app struggles to respond, making smart home control frustrating. The biggest issue is connectivity. The Deco A5400 mesh system itself has been unstable, frequently dropping connections or failing to properly integrate with Kasa devices. I’ve tried every troubleshooting method—resetting, repositioning nodes, firmware updates—but nothing has provided a long-term fix. To make matters worse, Google Home integration is unreliable at best, with devices often appearing offline or responding inconsistently to voice commands. For a smart home ecosystem, reliability is crucial, and TP-Link has not delivered. If you’re looking for a seamless smart switch and mesh WiFi combination, I’d strongly recommend looking at other brands.",
