This dimmer switch has an INSANE delay when shutting off the light, after pressing the off button there is a 2-3 second delay before anything happens at all. And sometimes it does nothing at all, just stays on, insane that they screwed up something as simple as a light switch... They're basically waiting to see if you'll be pressing and holding the button to dim it BEFORE doing anything at all, which is so bad for the user experience. There is also a Parameter 16 which when set to 1 will make this dimmer act like a normal on/off switch, BUT when you set this parameter to 1 then z-wave controls fail to turn it off!!!",

Adding this switch pushed my rather large HS3 system (previously living happily in obsolescence) over the edge. Much consternation, denial, expense, and effort later, I am converted to HS4 (Many thanks to Homeseer Help Desk people, who were patient and helpful in the transition). With the latest HS updates and a new Z-Net hub, I now have improved functionality in my system with this new switch as a powerful repeater in the HS network. I highly recommend Z-Wave, Z-Net, HS4, and this switch. I can't give 5 stars to something that set me on such a big, unplanned project. Those already on HS4 should love this dimmer/switch.",

        "text": "Edit: lowering to 4 stars. The fixed ramp up/down times are no good. My better half was annoyed by waiting a few seconds for the lights and I could not fix that with this dimmer; had to swap it with another brand. Original review: Compared to Zooz and Inovelli, these switches have a very limited set of configuration options. Compared to most other smart switches they have a lot of options. So far it’s been the least tricky of my Z wave dimmers, but that’s mostly because of the above. Are the 20-50% savings worth losing the configuration options? For lesser used dimmers I’d say yes.",
