        "text": "The Lutron Diva Smart Dimmer Switch has been a fantastic addition to my smart home setup. Its classic paddle design with a soft-glow light bar blends seamlessly with my existing decor, and the precise slider allows for easy dimming control. Installation was straightforward, and I appreciated that it doesn't require a neutral wire, making it compatible with older wiring systems. Pairing it with the Lutron Smart Hub enabled effortless control via the app and voice commands through Alexa. The ability to set schedules and scenes adds convenience, and the Smart Away feature provides peace of mind when I'm not home. Overall, it's a reliable and stylish solution for smart lighting control.",

Do not believe I have ever had an issue with Lutron switch, bridge, or app. Probably about 20 switchs in now so I guess you can say I'm sold.",

With most LEDs it will leak current and cause them to glow when off, requiring you to buy a $14 part to make them at least turn off, but then they will pulse and flicker when you turn them on, and they still will not dim. There are some specific bulbs that will work with this dimmer, but honestly its not worth it. Absolutely a waste of money, do not buy the dimmers.

        "text": "I absolutely love these Diva smart dimmer switches! They combine the familiar look of traditional paddle dimmers with the convenience and versatility of smart lighting. The soft-glow light bar and slider make dimming precise and easy to adjust, and the preset feature is so handy—I can turn my lights on exactly how I like them every time. The best part? No neutral wire is needed, so they worked perfectly in my older home without any extra wiring headaches. Pairing them with the Caséta hub opened up even more possibilities, from app control to voice commands with Alexa and Google Assistant. The smart away feature is a fantastic bonus, making my home look lived-in even when I’m not around. If you’re looking for an upgrade to your lighting system, these switches are an absolute must-have!",

I have a pico switch at our front door with \"All lights on\" and \"All lights off\" function. I know Lutron makes the best control products available from my line of work, but now I really understand - it is super user friendly and fast to install and program. There are a few bugs that I'm working out but, the best consumer-grade system by far. Now that everything is dimmed and controlled, I can concentrate on the lighting design of my house without software distraction. Works great with Google home so far.",

        "text": "I recently embarked on a journey to enhance the lighting in my home and stumbled upon what I now consider a hidden gem: the Lutron Diva Smart Dimmer Switch. Skeptical at first about its potential impact, I was quickly proven wrong. This little gadget has transformed my mundane lighting into an experience that's both functional and atmospheric. The installation process was surprisingly straightforward. I'm no electrician, but the clear instructions and simple design made it easy to integrate the dimmer into my existing setup. The real magic, however, began once I connected it to my home's Wi-Fi network. The ease of controlling my lights through my smartphone was a game-changer. I could adjust brightness levels from anywhere in my home, creating the perfect ambiance for any occasion. What truly sets this dimmer apart is its compatibility with LED lights. It smoothly transitions from bright to dim without any flickering, a common issue I've faced with other dimmers. This feature alone has elevated my evening relaxation routine, allowing me to create a soothing environment that's perfect for winding down. The energy-saving aspect is another highlight. Being environmentally conscious, I appreciate that this smart dimmer switch helps reduce electricity consumption, especially when paired with LED bulbs. It's comforting to know that enhancing my home's ambiance doesn't have to come at the expense of a higher energy bill or a larger carbon footprint. This dimmer switch has redefined my home lighting experience. It offers a perfect blend of convenience, efficiency, and style, seamlessly fitting into my daily life. If you're looking to upgrade your home lighting system, this smart switch is a choice you won't regret. It's more than just a dimmer; it's a small step towards a smarter, more comfortable home.",

This one is a great upgrade in user experience and the best option on the market for those of us without neutral wires as far as I can tell. The LED part of the dimmer gives you excellent feedback about light level and looks cool doing it. The tricky part about a smart dimmer with a tactile dimmer control is that you can change the dim level in the app and it can't move the tactile switch. The LED feedback is an elegant solution. I'm glad that I can both get the intuitiveness of a slide dimmer and still program one of my Pico remotes or routines to control the dim level and everything just works. No confusion! I imagine over the coming years I'll be slowly swapping out all our highly used switches with Divas.",

I bought just one of this smart version (DVRF) fully expecting it to have the same issues, but was pleasantly surprised that the construction quality is much higher AND dims with no issues. **edit: never mind, it worked flawlessly for a couple days but then the issue of bright flashes in certain dimming range came back.",

If you’re going to be installing it on someone who doesn’t mind spending extra for the hub when they already have a hub for their ring security system or have a apple mini hub. Than ya. Ok. But I have a client that has 5 “hubs already” and they don’t need another one. Go with eve or Meross. Especially if you have tons of switches you’re replacing. Eve for a smart fan and Meross for a cheap but effective and reliable switch for all the switches that are single pole. For example. I have a switch I wanted to turn on and off remotely for my laundry room. A Meross is cheap and works well with both Alexa and HomeKit l.",

No issues with hub range and responsiveness to the Lutron iphone app and homekit commands is instantaneous. Make sure you will be under 75 nodes before you start or you will regret not going with one of the more expensive Lutron RF systems (there’s no compatibility between them, so if you need to go bigger, you’ll have to rip and replace everything). Did everything myself - the first junction box was confusing but after examining it more carefully I figured out how the wiring was done in our house and now i can do a switch replacement in under 10 minutes. It’s exactly what I was hoping for and the equipment looks terrific.",

Model # DVRF-6L-WH-R Allows you to add a switch cover and give you a cleaner look. As seen in the first picture the switch cover is attached and second picture you can add it.

I had 8 light groups in my kitchen which is just ridiculous, so also added a Caseta Pico scene controller button to control them all. It is SO much simpler now to turn lights on and off, and with dimmers on all groups, I can set a different scenes with a lot of control. Currently working my way through replacing ALL light switches in the house with Diva and Claro switches.",

        "text": "I wanted to upgrade my bedroom light switch to one that had smart features so I can turn them on either by voice or through the app. I chose the Lutron Diva Smart dimmer because it has the traditional design and style of my existing switches and also didn't require a neutral wire. The installation was super easy. All I had to do was safely remove the old light switch and connect the line, load, and ground wires to the new one. The switch worked instantly after turning on the breaker switch. The dimming slider didn't need to be calibrated either. Also there's very small LEDs on the side that displays the light brightness as you're sliding it up and down. Additionally while the dimmer is not in use, the LEDs light up very dimly as a courtesy/guide light. It's not bothersome at all at night or when the lights are off. In order to use the smart features, you'll need to buy a Lutron hub. It's essentially a small device that connects to your router through an ethernet port. That'll enable the integration with your smart home devices. I've attached the photo of the completed installation here. I think the switch looks great. It has a modern flair with no screws on the mounting plate.",

        "text": "TLDR: Replaced the old \"no neutral\" lutron dimmer and it virtually eliminated light fluctuation that I had for 5 years. My dining room is the only switch without a neutral in the box, so I was forced to use the \"no neutral\" PDW-6WCL-WH dimmer paired with an LUT MLC module. At levels under 50%, it created a pretty noticeable fire lighting effect - such that the lights went slightly up and down like a flame. At levels over 50%, it was less noticeable but still present. I figured since this DIVA switch just came out, they may have made some improvements. That turned out to be exceptionally true. It now doesn't have any light fluctuation above 20% and isn't really noticeable until you get below 10% - still nowhere near as bad as the old dimmer was at 100% vs this one even at single digit percentages.",

Using the slider to adjust the desired intensity, double click the power on to override it and be at 100%. You can also override the slider from the app. That said, It is not possible to adjust the fade-in / fade-out when turning the light on/off. I don't mind the fade-out but I would like to adjust the fade-in timing especially at 90$. Note: Make sure you have a full size light switch junction box otherwise it won't fit.",
