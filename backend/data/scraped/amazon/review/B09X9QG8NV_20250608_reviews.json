I bought a set of 6 of these as a retrofit for the dimmer switches in my own home. My house is older and has rotary dimmers. Rotary dimmers don’t play well with dimmable LED lights as they will usually make the lights flicker and/or pulse. I wasn’t concerned about using a specific style of switch so I chose these switches due to the per-switch price point only. These switches are stated to be for LED lights so I figured they should be just fine for my need. Upon installing one I discovered that if I dim the lights, even slightly, the switch buzzes. The more I dimmed the light, the louder the buzz got. At their dimmest setting, the buzz could be heard around a corner and 20+ feet from the switches location. I removed that switch and tried another from the box. It did exactly the same thing. I also discovered that it still made the lights flicker while using the dimmer, which is the very reason I am replacing the old switches to begin with. The flicker wasn’t as bad as the old rotary switch, but still very bothersome & annoying none the less. I cannot recommend these switches in any way. I was able to return the switches for full refund.",
