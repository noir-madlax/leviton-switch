        "text": "I’m a licensed electrical contractor and typically use Pass & Seymour Legrand switches. I bought this ELEGRP 10-pack because of the price and high reviews, but I won’t make that mistake again. Right out of the box, the switches felt rough, clunky, and low quality ,definitely not what I’d call contractor-grade. I needed them for a job the next day, so I reluctantly installed six. One failed immediately and wouldn’t function at all. Because of that failure and how poor these feel, I’m planning to remove all of them and replace them with reliable switches. I can’t take the risk of callbacks or failures on a job. I’ve used ELEGRP outlets before without issue, but after this experience, I’m not sure I’ll trust anything from them going forward. Not worth the risk.",

The switches are cheap but if you value your time and all get a reputable brand so you don't feel the need to smash these cheap switches with a sledgehammer when you can't get the wires to stay put.",

The push in option also took a little effort for it to get in the hole.",

        "text": "Every other switch that I've installed connects wires using one of two ways: Either the wire slides into a hole \"quick-connect\", or you screw the wire to the side screw. This switch, however, you install by inserting the wire into a hole on the back, and then tightening the screw, which pulls a square nut that's inside of the housing to secure the wire. The problem is that 14AWG or larger doesn't fit into the holes with the large square nuts inside. (The nut obstructs the hole.) Also, you can't secure the wire to the outside because the screw is secured to the square washer inside alone rather than the housing itself, so it won't remain straight enough to hold the wire. I'm not sure why they designed them this way, perhaps the quick connect and side screws are patented or something. Buy these if you have small gauge wire, or enjoy being frustrated.",

        "text": "They're cheap, but solid. Of couse, can't beat Leviton and Lutron brands. Leviton and Lutron are expensive, therefore, it's a better option. For decorator wallplates, don't buy them from ELEGRP. Go with \"ENERLITES Screwless Decorator'. Trust me, they will make your life easier, furthermore, ENERLITES have so many colors to choose from. BUT ENERLITES receptacle isn't that good. Therefore, buy receptacle from ELEGRP, but for wallplates, go for ENERLITES. ELEGRP wallplates are very difficult to open. Most of the times, you end up breaking them.",
