        "text": "I have installed several of these in both single and three-way light switches. This was to correct a very inconvenient switch layout in a new house. So far, they have performed perfectly and I have yet to change out a battery on the transmitter. You will need to have a neutral at the switch location, also to convert a three way, you will need to convert it to a normal single switch configuration (i. e., trace out the hot leg and the wire to the light and put the relay in this location). Other than that, the installation is very straightforward. It is a far better solution than pulling new wires to create a three way in a new location, since one relay can have up to eight switches (according to the manufacturer). I wouldn’t recommend it for any application except lighting as I don’t know what is the quality of the relay, nor how many switchings it will do in normal life expectancy. The blue LED indicates that the transmitter switch is functioning, which is convenient",

        "text": "I see a lot of folks asking how they can install it at the light switch itself when it's just two hot wires and a ground. Dont do that. Instead do it at the light fixture itself. Then it will seem simpler as there will only be a hot and neutral there most of the time. Also don't use the wire connectors that come with it. Even if you connect it it doesn't seem up to code to me. Buy your own wire connectors like the traditional yellow or orange. Finally I found it easier just to connect all of the neutrals together (two from the signal box, one front the fixtures, and one from the wall. Best of luck to you. Works great for me. Sidenote: it should go without saying but please turn your power off at the fuse box before installing.",

My first five were used to solve a tricky problem where I cut through a wall to join two sides of a duplex on a long hall with a stairwell. The existing 3 way wired switch (bottom and top of the stairs) to control the hall lighting was not going to work and a lot of wiring was going to be needed to allow lights to be switched on and off at each end of the hall and by the rooms along the hall in addition to a switch at the bottom of the stairs. Using Thinkbee 3 ways, connected to two lights in the hall ceiling, I was able to wirelessly set up a neat and safe system that has been working with zero problems for 3 years. I just put in two more Thinkbees to upgrade a fan only switch in a bathroom to fan and light separate switches for a upgraded fan to light/fan installed without having to pull new wire up the wall and across the ceiling. Big time saver. Again, setup is very easy and these Thinkbee devices just work when installed and keep on working over time.",

        "text": "I replaced a fan with a light fixture. The previous fan used the pull chains to turn on and off instead of a wall switch. I researched several options for adding a non WiFi switch and decided to use the Thinkbee remote switch. It was very easy to add inline between your existing electrical wires and light if you have any handyman skills (or have a contractor do it). The kit comes with 2 wire lever nuts (similar to Wagu lever nuts) that made it easy to connect all the wires. The switch synced quickly to the inline box and has been working perfectly for over a month. The remote switch appears very sturdy and works by \"clicking\" the remote. The light turns on instantly without any delay. I haven't tested how far away the remote works since I keep the remote in the same room as the light. I am very happy with the remote switch and I would buy it again.",

The controllers get hot and neutral from the power coming in obviously. This will look like a mess in the box, don't get me wrong, but will allow you to have to separate stitches to the light and fan.

        "text": "Rain damaged my backyard pipes and cooked all my wires, which are now abandoned. Luckily, I still have remote power source to hook up to the lights but no way to switch the lights in the house 450ft away. I bought the self power version but it worked 50% of the time. And once I tug the receiver inside the electrical box (outside), it barely worked. I bought this one, add another electrical box on top of the existing just to house the receiver and it works perfectly with the switch inside the house. I even let the antenna fold inside the box. I think if I let the antenna stick outside the range could even be better. Compare this and the self power version, not sure if the improvements are from the powered switch, or the better receiver with external antenna, or both. What if using the self power switch with this type of receiver still produce the same results so we don’t have to worry about changing the switch’s battery down the line. Great product regardless.",

        "text": "I got it on time. I purchased it because the former owner changed the door's opening direction but did not relocate the light switch, which is behind the door. I also did not want to hire an electrician to relocate the switch. I encountered an issue. It could be an exception to my case. The connection of the two lines that go to the bulb is matter. On my first attempt, It did not work; I swapped the two lines, and it worked. I wanted to share my experience. Another experience is buying the cover if you plan to install it in a room. It seems I have to buy a block cover to install the remote on the wall. The remote needs a battery, and although people mentioned that it may take years to change it, we need to consider this requirement. Update: I used Commands to stick the remote to the wall.",

By installing the receiver into the junction box the installation was neat and clean. The storage unit had a very high ceiling (14’) and the existing single light was activated by a motion sensor. Using this item I could place the on/off switch anywhere in the unit or use it as a remote to be carried in your pocket. Works great!",
