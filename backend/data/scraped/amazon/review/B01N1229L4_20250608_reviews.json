        "text": "The hardest part of the installation was trying to get the switch body to fit in the electrical box. I replaced the fan/light switch in a 41 year old house. This switch comes with wires for 3-way operation. There is no way that another Romex cable would fit in the box I had. In fact I cut the two 3-way switch wires off to get this switch to fit in my single gang box. If you're doing new construction or if you can replace a small box, use the 20 cu in box for this switch. This is the third switch in this location and hopefully the last with its lifetime warranty.",

        "text": "This device is intended to be in a box that has the hot feed for the circuits. It has one hot for both. That's great if your other three-ways are in a distant box that also has the feeds for the fan/lamp. Unfortunately, my existing three-ways are in the box with the hot on the other side of the room. The box with the feed to the fan/light just has the two travelers from those two three-ways (and the neutrals). Since this device binds both hots you can't separate it out to go to the two devices. If that doesn't make sense - if you had two standard three-way switches, each one would have two travelers and a hot. That's six wires. This combo switch only has five - two sets of travelers and a common hot for both circuits. Fine on one end of the circuit pair, useless on the other.",

Now the best thing about this switch is that you can use it to bypass the remote control that comes with Hunter fans as long as you have a 4-wire electrical wire between the switch and the fan. I imagine the same would work for other fans, like Hampton Bay. Why would I want to bypass the remote? Because I hate is the remote control. But if you like the remote, you don't need to read the rest since the basic single-pole light switch and fan remote will work great for you. I have 4 Hunter fans with LED's in the bedrooms of our home. To keep everything clean (no remote mounted next to the switch) and uniform, I used 4 of these switches. I basically followed the instructions for installing the ceiling fan. But instead of connecting the remote receiver in the fan, I just wired the separate fan and light wires directly to the switch. That's why you need the 4-wire electrical cable between the switch and the fan. The dimmer and 3-position switch works great and no more looking for remotes. Why not 5 stars? I don't know. Because nothing is perfect?",

They're all made by Legrand and I assumed they were the same model as this one, but I don't know for sure now because this one makes the lights flicker like crazy. I'm positive that the LEDs I'm using are dimmable because when I switch them to the other ceiling fans using the other dimmer switches, they work perfectly. Maybe this is a slightly different model and/or maybe their quality control isn't great and I got a lemon.",

It has 3 steps of dimming, while the other dimmer is a true slider. I'd like to not have the steps in the one side.

        "text": "This switch works very well, puts all the control into a single slot (good for old homes that only had a single wall switch). I didn't want a remote setup, due to all the drawbacks with remotes. So this switch was perfect. The Light Dimmer (smooth glide) works extremely well with the Dimmable LEDs on my fan. The 'calibration wheel' next to the slider allowed for precise tuning of how I wanted the low to be. Very pleased. The Fan Slider (3 stop points) works decent too. However the lowest notch, may be a bit 'too low' in speed, depending on your fan, weight of its blades, and power it needs to turn at low speed. Mine moves air, but you dont 'feel it' blowing, on the low setting. Electrical Tip: This needs a deep electrical box. I had a standard size 1-gang box, but ended up having to use a 20cu (deepest I could find) box to fit all the wires, wire nuts, and cram it all in and get it fastened. So, keep that in mind.",

We are hopeful with only having to flip the switch at the bottom and not actually pull a switch up and down every time it will last much longer. The left side is the light and the right side has three speeds for the fan. This is ONLY for fan & light combos. So glad I found this one! Only wish we had found it sooner.

        "text": "I looked at a lot of fan-light dimmer combo switches before deciding on this one. Most of the other ones have a few common design flaws that many reviewers mentioned- the slide buttons were too small, especially for big hands, the buttons were too hard to slide up and down, and/or they broke too easily. Having owned a few of these dimmers I can attest that all of this is true. This one is different. The buttons are pretty big, they slide easily, and they seem sturdier than the other dimmers I've had. Plus this one has a feature not often seen in these combo dimmers- a separate on-off switch for both the fan and light. So if you get your dimmer just where you want it you don't have to set it back to that point every time you power on. Just hit the power switch and it's back to the same level as when you turned it off. I like that. This unit costs a bit more than most of the others, but I figure it's going to last a long time, so for me it's worth it. I'm happy with it.",

        "text": "Although it took us nearly a month to finally set aside some time to install this combination dimmer light/fan switch, once we did we were 100% pleased with the results! We did not install this on a fan/light combination but rather two light switches: one that operated an overhead light in a pantry and the second that operated 2 LED HALO downlights in the kitchen ceiling. We wanted the pantry light to be either on or off but we wanted the downlights to be dimmable. So, we installed the 3-speed fan switch to operate the pantry light and the dimmer to operate the downlights and each works - perfectly! The pantry light will dim at each of the 3 speed settings but we simply use the toggle switch to operate the light. The dimmer side definitely dims the downlights but it does not dim them all the way which is actually a great feature. If they were dimmed too far we might not notice they were still on and we would prematurely age the LED lights inadvertently. So, we're pleased at the various levels of light output the dimmer will provide and then being able to turn the downlights on or off at our favorite level is exactly what we were looking for! This is a great product and, yes, a little pricey but when you have two switches in a single box we're just just happy to pay the price for something that works!",
