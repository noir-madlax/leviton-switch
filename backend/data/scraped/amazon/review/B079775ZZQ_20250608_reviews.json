        "text": "I've bought 12 TP-Link smart light switches over the past 3-4 years. Two weeks ago, one just stopped working. I figured, okay, stuff happens. But then—boom—another one dies the following week. The day after that? A third one goes out. That’s three failures in under two weeks. Out of curiosity, I checked TP-Link’s website. Surprise, surprise: the warranty is only 1–2 years. Guess what? All three failed right after the warranty expired. These things aren’t defective — they’re engineered to fail once you’re no longer covered. That’s not a coincidence. That’s a planned-obsolescence scam. These smart switches are not “smart”—they’re a stupid waste of money. Regular light switches last 10–20 years, while these overpriced plastic toys can’t even last two. DO NOT BUY these switches. I don’t care how fancy the app is or what brand it is — TP-Link or otherwise. If it needs replacing every couple of years, it’s trash. Stick with old-school switches. They’re cheap, reliable, and they don’t leave you in the dark — literally.",

        "text": "I have several of these dimmable smart switches throughout the house, unfortunately the quality is sub-part after experiencing several failures within the first year of use. The issue is that the switch fails to energize the load (connected device/light). It powers on fine, has network connectivity, and can be interacted with via smart device apps, but it doesn't turn on the light. A test with a multi-meter confirms that it fails to actually energize the connection, so the problem isn't downstream from the switch. Online searches confirm this seems to be a common issue with TP-Link switches where the internal relay fails which results in the described issue. I contacted company support who didn't give me any issues with RMA'ing the product, but there's one serious problem. You have to pay to ship them the defective unit... I went to my UPS store with the product packaged & boxed, but the cost to ship was more than the cost of the switch on Amazon, making it not worth the money to RMA because it would be cheaper to just buy another unit than replace the failed one. Because of this scenario, TP-Link is now off of my list for Smart Home devices and all future purchases will be another brand, even if more expensive.",

However, their Standard RMA process requires you to pay for return shipping, wait for them to process the return (3-5 days after receipt), and then they will send out a replacement, leaving you without a switch for weeks. The Advanced RMA options cost $25-$50, much more then the price of a new switch on Amazon. Frustrated by this poor warranty service, I’ve decided to avoid TP-Link products entirely. I’m going to return a recently purchased TP-Link wireless router within its return period, despite it having no issues so far.",

        "text": "I rarely write reviews, but my experience with TP-Link was so frustrating that I had to speak up and warn others. I bought a brand-new TP-Link smart switch that turned out to be defective. When I contacted support, they required me to remove the switch and ship it back first at my own expense. Only after they receive it will they send a replacement—and they don’t even confirm whether it will be new, used, or refurbished. This process has dragged on for over 20 days, and it’s still not resolved. TP-Link responds to emails once a day, and every time I try to explain the situation, I just get the same generic response. I’ve explained multiple times that removing the switch without having a replacement is unsafe for my kids, but they simply don’t care. All I asked for was a replacement to be sent first along with a prepaid return label. This is standard practice with many companies that value their customers—but not TP-Link. At this point, the cost of returning the switch is almost the same as buying a new one. It’s ridiculous. I’ve wasted weeks dealing with their support and still have no resolution. I’m done with TP-Link. Their support is slow, unhelpful, and inconsiderate. I will never buy from them again and I strongly encourage others to stay far away. Spend a little more with a company that actually backs their products and treats customers with respect.",

I've spent more time wrestling with its \"local access only\" error than I have actually enjoying dimmed lighting. I'm starting to think \"local access\" is Kasa's fancy way of saying \"you're stuck with a glorified on/off switch.\" \"Works with Alexa and Google Home,\" they said. \"Seamless integration,\" they promised. Lies! All lies! I've reset this thing more times than I've had hot dinners. I've unplugged, replugged, danced a ritualistic jig around my router, and still, it mocks me with its \"local access only\" message. Need a neutral wire? Fine, I get it. But apparently, you also need the patience of a saint and the technical prowess of a NASA engineer to get this thing to work properly. I'm tech-savvy, and this switch has me ready to throw it through a window. Forget about remotely controlling your lights. Forget about setting schedules. Forget about impressing your friends with your \"smart home.\" You'll be too busy cursing Kasa and wondering why you didn't just stick with a dumb, reliable switch. UL Certified? More like UL-timately frustrating. No hub required? More like a hub of endless headaches. Save yourself the trouble and buy something else. Anything else. This switch is a monument to wasted time and shattered expectations. If I could give it zero stars, I would.",

I changed out the switch thinking it was defective. I decided to try pairing a Smart Plug to rule out my router and had no issues.

        "text": "I purchased a large number of KASA smart switches for my new home, and have generally been satisfied with their operation. Unfortunately, one of the HS220 switches recently failed, after having functioned normally for about 14 months. Once the switch stopped working, the switch itself appeared normal - with the circular light on the switch turning on and off as the switch was depressed. The switch, however, no longer turned the attached 2 LED ceiling lights on or off via any of the 3 modes: depressing the switch, via the KASA App on my phone or via voice commands (Alexa). Resetting the switch did not correct the problem, nor did turning power off at the breaker panel for ~1 minute. Once removed, the body of the switch showed no signs of discoloration that might suggest that any of the internal circuitry had overheated. In contacting KASA for replacement of the switch under their 2-year warranty, I was given various options to return the defective switch - all of which requiring me to spend at least $14.99 (or much more) to replace the failed switch for which I paid $14.96 for when new. The current price for a new HS220 switch on Amazon is $16.99. Since KASA was unwilling to simply provide a no-cost return shipping label, I purchased a new HS220 switch from Amazon, and the new switch is operating normally. I sincerely hope that the remaining 20+ KASA smart switches that I have installed do not exhibit such failures, as I would like to continue to utilize switches from a single manufacturer to simplify operation of my \"smart\" home. It is unfortunate that KASA has little interest in obtaining failed, lower price items (such as switches), both to permit them to understand the root cause of such fails and to retain customer satisfaction and loyalty.",

One switch, the HS220 one-way dimmer switch works perfectly manually, but refuses to connect with the WiFi network. I reached out to their tech support team via email (the only option). Over the course of nearly a week, they repeatedly asked me for the same information and never tried to fix the problem. My only resort was to return the switch to Amazon, and obtain and install a new one. Hopefully, that one will work. So, my rating for the peoducts is between 4vans 5 stars. My rating for T-link customer service and tech support is 0 stars. They will waste your time and energy needlessly.",

I emailed for suppot, and the Mfr Support asked for a ridiculous amount of information, then didn't respond. Here's the info they asked, despite me sending the amazon invoice showing I bought 2 of them: TP-Link ID App Version Model and OS of phone Model and Brand of the Router Screenshot of error message, if any. What is the LED status of the device? Please provide Picture of the S/N and hardware version of your device on its back label or on the box. Kindly send us a receipt or invoice for the device, including details such as the name of the store, unit name/price, and date of purchase. These are both hard-wired into my house, so taking a picture of the back will require the electrician to come back out. If you are going to purchase these, take pictures before they are installed, otherwise you're SOL.",
