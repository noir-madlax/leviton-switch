        "text": "These were fairly easy to install and the Alexa integration was not too difficult. After about 10 months of use, however, the manual switches don’t respond reliably. You can still control them with Alexa but you can press them manually several times and nothing will happen. I’m slowly replacing all of theses with Lutron switches. You get what you pay for on these. The Lutrons are more expensive but I installed several of those at the some time as these and they still work flawlessly (and look nicer too). Also, the red light for on and green light for off is weird. I could deal with that if they worked for more than a year, but they don’t.",

        "text": "The only thing you want a smart switch to do is at least to be as good as an old mechanical switch. You expect from a switch to consistently and instantly turn the light on and off as soon as you press it. This one doesn't. It's been working pretty much normally for a while, but in recent days it's only working sometimes. Sometimes I press the switch and it turns the light on or off, but sometimes it takes a few seconds or it just does nothing. It seems to depend on both the internet connection and the Smartlife services to be working fine. That is a stupid design flaw that speaks for the bad quality of the product. I don't want to lose the ability to switch lights on and off from the wall switch just because my internet connection isn't working well or if Smartlife's services aren't working well. Do not buy this product.",

        "text": "Works well! We normally use Phillips Hue bulbs but we were updating our light fixtures to include multiple small bulbs so that would have been way more expensive. I like that I can choose to turn it off/on manually via the switch or via app/Google home -- for the Hue lights if you use the wall switch to turn off you can no longer turn it on remotely. I did have trouble getting it to connect to wifi but customer support was able to help. Now that it's connected it works flawlessly. One downside compared to the Hue is that the bulbs aren't dimmable with the switch (at least I don't think) but it didn't claim to be dimmable so I can't fault the product for that. Overall very happy.",

        "text": "I got the three switch setup. Understand though, this is just a 3-pack of switches and a 3 switch plate. You do NOT have to put them into the same place (and they fit fine with my existing three switch plate because we have the wide/flat type switch already). Wiring was pretty straight forward, but you do have to pay attention to make sure you wire the correct wires. For most homes with a standard switch, it matters little if they reverse the wires - a standard switch just completes the circuit. For these, you have to connect the correct wires, so if the person that did your wiring was lazy, it can be annoying sorting out the wires. Setup was simple after getting them installed correctly and Alexa app integration was simple and fast.",
