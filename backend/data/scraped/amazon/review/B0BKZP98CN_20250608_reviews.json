It's also apparently Alexa compatible, but I didn't need that. If you want the most reliable operation of this (or any) remote control, especially at greater distance, 2.4 is the way to go. You do not need the additional bandwidth 5GHz can provide in order to operate a light switch although this item does provide that frequency, and, if used in the same room as the switch, the remote should never have any trouble.",

I 'was able to get them both tother in jar. Unfortunately, this device has zero safety certifications, no UL, no ETL and not even CE. So that doesn’t gives you confidence on product safety. It only has FCC certification but that one doesn’t cover safety. So keep that in mind. I wish they had their certifications since it seems like a well made product. I wish I could give them at least 4 stars but safety is very important for a device that is connected 24/7.",

        "text": "First of all- it works. Lights turn on and off, dimmer works, remote all good. But that’s all. In hindsight I would have preferred to spend $20 more and get a name brand dimmer. -the wiring and the directions are NOT correct. The labels on the actual wires for “load”, “neutral”, “ground” do NOT match the colors and descriptions on the instructions. Extremely odd, and for someone with only a basic knowledge and comfort level in electrical work this really was not a fun experience installing. I had to trace around the wires on my wall and watch a few videos and really just make my best guess. -the actual wall unit and remote just feel cheap. Light plastic, not super flush and tight, creaks when a button is pressed… and you have to “push the buttons correctly”- hard and to the right. Lol. If you don’t, they don’t work. You could be sitting there pushing away with no result. It supposedly works with Amazon Alexa, although I have not tried it and don’t know how that would work anyway. Based on my experience so far it’s likely more trouble than it’s worth. I also don’t feel a need to verbally turn off my lights when I have a remote and also legs. These issues are the core of what matters for a dimmer switch other then “if it works”. So yes, it works. But assuming you don’t want to shut off your power and swap out light switches multiple times, just get a better one.",

        "text": "Attractive looking, with attractive price. Solves the problem of remote control of a single pole switch from any number of other locations without wiring. The remotes look good, like the more expensive pico remotes, and allow dimming at the remote. They fit nicely in a decora opening and seem to work reliably. However, there are some serious quirks. First of all, realize that this device only works with Alexa. It cannot be controlled with any other mobile app like most other wifi device. For example no control with Tuya or SmarLife apps like many chinese devices sold on Amazon can be. Secondly, when power goes out and comes back on, these switches will turn the light on which will stay on till you turn it off. This created a problem for me as I was installing the switch at a remote home where I am not there all the time, and we lose power there a lot. Without an app to control it, I can't turn things off after a power outage and the lights stay on till we visit the house again weeks later. This should not be the normal behavior and the switch should either revert to off or to its pre-outage state. Additionally, I don't use Alexa and it does not provide easy scheduling controls like other mobile apps.",

        "text": "This single pole smart switch and remote set, works well in several configurations to add additional functionality and smart capabilities to your existing single pole or 3 way light switches. The instructions for single pole are straightforward, but it can get very complex when converting an existing 3way switch, so this single pole plus remote, you essentially have to disable/bypass one switch of the 3way circuit and place and use the remote as though it was the other switch in the circuit. Once completed, it looks like a much more expensive well known brand of smart switch, and Alexa learns it's presence once power is reconnected. On/off and dimming functions work via voice command and button input on the switch or remote, but every so often, the remote will fail to connect and all buttons will be unresponsive with no LED's illuminated. Cycling the light off then off again usually corrects this error, but it happens frequently enough to be an annoyance. Also this switch cannot be controlled by Google or anything but Alexa so keep your personal ecosystem in mind when getting this, but if you don't mind those small annoyances this is a great affordable smart light switch for you.",
