Works perfectly as Single Pole / Single Toggle or with Sunnata Accessory switch as part of a 3-way or 4-way. Programmable features (such as variable intensity Switch night / locator light). Really like the touch/hold 2 seconds option that dims lights to off 30 seconds later. Totally stable with ceiling surface and recessed-can replacement LEDs. Some intermittent flickering (1 or 2 times a week at startup) with 100 W equivalent LED bulbs (bulb or fixture???). Almost no intermittent flicker with 60W equivalent bulbs. Works extremely well with incandescent bulbs.",

I have persistent issues with them turning themselves on at full or partial brightness, when no-one has been anywhere near the switch. An example - I have a seldom-used guest bedroom, and I’ve had to start routinely checking it each day because I’ll find that the dimmer switch is inexplicably set to ~10% brightness (bulbs not even visibly on, but the switch’s light-bar is 10% illuminated) or even fully-on. Either a) I have ghosts/unauthorized guests, or b) there is something weird in my house wiring (other switches all seem to work fine), or c) there’s a glitch in the Lutron switch units I have. I’d still recommend them, but it’s a puzzler.",

        "text": "Let's be clear - I dont mess with electricity ever! In fact, this was my first install of anything beyond a smoke alarm which didn't need electricity anyhow! This was an easy install... 15 minutes tops and that was mostly to double check everything I was doing 10 times over. I like how you just slide your finger up and down and dont need to actually press anything to adjust. It's pretty slick. And it has a soft glowing bar that lets you know if the lights are 1/3rd dimmed or 3/4 or wherever you stop your finger. It's modern and is very seamless and unobtrusive on a wall. The trickiest thing was the wall plate and separating it so I could screw the base plate in and then reattach the wall plate to the base. They come connected and separating them makes it feel like you will break it. Use an old credit card to slip between them and they pop apart. We looked that up online. Otherwise, easy install like I said. They could just use that pro-tip in their directions!",

It will dim my LED lights work no flickering and some of the nicest and smoothest dimming transitions I've seen and very responsive to your touch, can be turned on by simply touching the switch and sliding your finger up and down for desired brightness and the lighted strip on the side makes it easy to find in the dark. Even my electrician was impressed and took the info so he can install these in his home highly recommend if you need a dimmer switch, especially for LED light fixtures",

It allows me to keep on of the switches \"normal\" and use this switch (either physically ) or using the Lutron app. I also have a Lutron Caseta Smart Hub, so I also get the ability to use this with my Amazon Alexa. It wasn't too difficult to install and the instructions are pretty straight-forward even with limited electrical experience. It's really nice to be able to control my overhead lighting with this switch remotely.",

What I Like 👍 + came with a seamless switch plate. + Easy to install and the wires were labeled (which is honestly quite rare) + touch sensor to adjust the light. + worked on the first try. What I dislike 👎 - touch sensor. This is a personal preference but I prefer the physical slider model over this touch sensor. My worry is “what if…” it fails or doesn’t respond to my inputs? - Not really a switch. Both ends of the paddle switch are just little clicking buttons. So there is really no switching going on just clicking of the two buttons (on and off). Again a personal preference, but I prefer physical switches over fully digital. Overall this is a great product. If you like something with a more modern look and functionality then this is a great option. If you’re more like me and prefer physical touch, then check out one of their other models that offer the same functionality.",

The touch bar to slide and set the dimmer is pretty awesome. The light bar is bright when using the dimmer, but subdued when the switch is off. As mentioned in the product features, the soft glow at night helps spot the switch in the dark. Although this dimmer supports LED bulbs, I use it with fixtures which still have incandescent bulbs. Why? Because it's a room that we rarely have the lights on in, and the soft on and soft off feature also helps significantly extend the life of the bulbs. That is one feature that I think is absolutely essential for dimmers: A soft ramp to on, and a soft ramp to off. With incandescent bulbs, it gently heats the filament and reduces the thermal shock to it. This significantly extends the life of incandescent bulbs. In fact, I have had the same incandescent bulbs in one fixture for over nine years now. I highly recommend this dimmer for someone looking for something that is still easy to use, and offers some of the best dimmer features.",

This one is no exception, since it's their LED hybrid dimmer behind a fancy cover plate. I'd admit to preferring the Maestro control or Skylark slider, but this one looks cool and feels cool to use. Would definitely fit into a more modern setting. Install is pretty similar to every other dimming switch. All of the required wire nuts and cover plate are included. Just bring your screwdriver.",

The wall plate is designed in a screwless manner, providing a modern and sleek appearance. Although the item comes with a relatively higher price tag, it is a dependable switch that has been utilized in a recent renovation project without any reported issues. Installing the dimmer switch is a breeze, and the switch's back's size is small enough to fit into a standard single-gang box. The kit comes complete with a backing plate and a screwless cover that can be effortlessly mounted over the switch, giving a tidy and modern appearance. The switch is fashioned with a touch panel that enables the user to choose the desired light level. The light on the touch panel signifies the level of brightness selected. The switch can be turned on and off by tapping the top or bottom. When the lights are turned off, the touch dimmer emits a faint glow, making it effortless to locate the switch in the darkness without being distracting. This dimmer switch has undergone rigorous testing and is proven to be a reliable addition to your home. ✅I hope you’ve found the information and my review helpful.✅",

        "text": "These dimmers are a really nice improvement to the standard slide dimers I’m used to. It looks cleaner and the capacitive touch slider makes for a nicer experience. Something to note is that these aren’t rocker switches as much as they are momentary rockers. What I mean by that is the switch doesn’t lock into the up or down position, but rather it clicks when you press up or down and returns to the same resting position in the center. It was a little weird at first, but I got used to it. It is nice if it’s wired as a 3-way switch since you don’t have the up or down position being seen as on or off. I like that it’s UL listed. It’s well made and comes with everything you need right out of the box. The screwless wall plate adds to the clean look, although I don’t know why Lutron uses a visible 2-piece design. It’s one of the only things that I’m not a fan of on this combo kit. Overall, it’s an easy upgrade to update the look and feel of your dimmer switches if you care to do so.",

Operation of the dimmer is by touch, so it can be a little tricky to get used to. The switch face is a toggle. Push the top to turn the light on and the bottom to switch it off. Now if you want to dim it, the face of the switch is a touch-sensitive pad. Just slide a finger up or down to dim. It's not quite as easy to finely control as a slider or rotating dimmer, but it's not bad.",

        "text": "We have these light switches installed in most of our main living areas. They are incredibly clean looking and so satisfying to use. It’s not a hard install, simply turn off the circuit breaker to that room and swap out your switch. The wires are attached by little screws. We get compliments on our switches every time guest come over. The actually rocker switch works great but the best part is the light bar dimmer. It always glows so you can see it in the dark (brightness can be adjusted) and you slide your finger up and down the touch light bar to adjust the dimness in the room. Reliable brand, amazing product. You won’t regret these!",
