        "text": "Several years ago I replaced all my dimmers with “Smart” dimmers. Not sure exactly what the extra wire is in my house, but it IS NOT a neutral and nothing worked unless manually from each individual dimmer. Went back through and put all old dimmers back in. Fast-forward a bit and I found this line from Leviton that works without a neutral and through a WiFi Bridge that connects to WiFi. I tested several while getting started and they worked great. It has dimmers & switches working through the WiFi Bridge and plugs & dimmer plugs connecting directly to WiFi Between dimmers and switches I probably have almost 30, and about 20 WiFi Smart plugs all working perfectly!",

        "text": "The switch is beautiful and works very well for up to 4 LED bulbs, but fails dramatically at six bulbs on the circuit. With six LED bulbs at full brightness, the switch repeatedly turns on, then flickers off and reboots (I tried with three different switches, and all behaved the same). Fortunately, Leviton’s app allows you to set a maximum brightness percentage and the switch can handle the six bulbs at just under 50%. It’s unfortunate they won’t go brighter without killing the switch. I haven’t had problems with the bridge, but it’s plugged in only 6 feet from the switch.",
