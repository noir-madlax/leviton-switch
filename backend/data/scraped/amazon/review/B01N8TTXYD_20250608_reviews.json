At both high and low settings it flickers, not continuously but occasionally. On the middle setting it is less often but overall not pleased. The other rooms in the house with the same LED bulbs do not flicker at all so I know it is not the circuit or bulbs...must be the dimmer. Not another brand for me to try at the moment so I'm stuck.

I took a chance on this one and it worked perfectly right out of the box. Very well made device imo. I just swopped out my SP switch for this one. Worked as hoped. I did follow the directions regarding setting the low end of the dimmer. It was an easy adjustment. Only took two circuit shutoffs to get the full range of dimming of my Vanoopee lights. Very pleased with the product. Very pleased with the 10W Vanoopee 3 color dimmable integral LED track light heads too.",

Dimmers can be touchy about LED lighting. Especially if your having trouble with regular fixtures and LED bulbs. These worked flawlessly. In fact, I want to install a dimmer switch over my Dining Room table. I chose this model for my own house and am expecting it's arrival today. I foresee no issues with this quality product. Be aware that there is an adjustment lever to achieve the perfect 'no flicker' level when installing. Fairly easy install if you follow directions. TURN OFF ALL POWER, and verify no voltage before install! SAFETY FIRST! Live another day to enjoy tomorrow's problems. :)",

        "text": "We are completing an extensive home renovation and purchased four of these switches for bathrooms and main living areas. First, do not purchase open box here because those didn’t work at all. Second, the dimmer in the bathroom attached to one sconce with three LED bulbs works well. However, when we used the switch for recessed lighting in the living room (hairy eight 15 watt LEDs) it flickered and buzzed like crazy at all levels of dimming. We switched it out for a Lutron dimmer switch which interestingly is actually rated for lower wattage (150 watt vs the 450 Legrand advertises) and it performed flawlessly. It’ll be Lutron for us from here on out I guess.",

Sure, a slider might look lower tech than a button with a revolving light, but I can quickly set the brightness exactly where I want it without cycling through different levels of brightness. I would estimate the brightness goes from about 30-40% to 100%, so with super bright bulbs it doesn't get that dim, but it's still very noticeably brighter at the high end and comfortably dim at the low end and I could always get dimmer bulbs if I wanted more wiggle room on the dim end.

        "text": "The look and feel of this is just overall nicer than Lutron's competing decorator dimmer. I really appreciate the matte look and feel - it's less prone to scratching and scuffing and looks a lot nicer than the high gloss options from competitors. Lutron decorator dimmers have wires that protrude from them and require you to use wire nuts to join them with the wiring in your electrical boxes. These, however, have the standard screw terminals that allow for not only the standard J-hook, but also for back-wiring (back, not push-in, which is inferior). The back wiring makes it really easy to quickly and securely replace a lot of switches in a short time frame. The little light on the switch that turns on when the switch is off is also fantastic - it's bright enough to see in the dark, but not bright enough to be an eyesore or call attention to itself. What's the catch? Unfortunately, it seems that this switch has a hard time with LEDs. I tried installing in two different places with different fixtures and bulbs. Despite adjusting the minimum dimming setting on the switch (which is not as easy to adjust as Lutron's), one set of dimmable bulbs would not dim at all. The other barely had any dimmable range and buzzed loudly at all settings. Ripped these out and replaced them with the Lutron switches that had a much better dimming range and didn't cause lights to buzz.",

Cheaper brands fail with weird LED watt levels or create a flicker on bulbs at the dimmest setting. Nothing more to say but the brand is top tier vs standard builder grade switches. Worth the extra few dollars since switches last so long I cannot imagine how people lived before illuminated switches…. Truly the dark ages",

At minimum setting of the slider, your lights should not be all the way off, that's what the on-off switch is for. The calibration adjustment can prevent lights from going out completely when the dimmer is at minimum setting. That's a very nice feature, in my opinion. The instructions tell you not to make calibration adjustments with the power on. I would heed that advice.",

No matter how many different (dimmable) LED bulbs I installed, I experienced occasional flickering as well as times where I would turn on the switch and the bulbs would dimly light, although the dimmer was turned all the way up. The problem would solve itself by switching the light off, and then back on again. I tried adjusting the wheel on the side to no avail as the problems mentioned above continued. I replaced the switch with the simple GE dimmer and all problems went away. I packaged this one up and sent it back for a refund.",
