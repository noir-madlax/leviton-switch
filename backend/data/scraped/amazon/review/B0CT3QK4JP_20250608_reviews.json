        "text": "Works as I expected: top switch acts as a light dimmer, and bottom switch is a separate non-dimming timer. Three things to note: (1) The device is deep, and generally will require a large electrical box. (2) Any LEDs on the dimmer circuit must be designed for dimming. Partially, this is so there is some \"leakage\" current through the device, even when off, to power the control logic for both switches. (3) Both switches operate from the same supply, so the dimmer and timer must be on the same circuit. (Not an unreasonable limitiation.) If I had more space to work with I would likely have used two separate devices, and probably saved some money.",

Now, when I do a bath renovation, I try to put the fan on a timer switch and obviously that works less well if it turns out the light as well. Since there was just a single box available, this was the perfect solution. In addition, when I told my client about the switch she mentioned that she preferred less light in the bathroom, so the dimmer on the light side of the switch was perfect for her. If you have a double box available, you probably don’t need this, but for my application, this will make everyone happy.",

        "text": "Wow, I had been watching Lutron (and other) products for years to find this set of switches, where you can turn the light on and off separate from a timed fan control for the bathroom. Couldn't believe it took that long to carry one that reviewers think is worth a salt. This one works, hooray! Follow the instruction video with the link provided and it will go a lot quicker -- it was a little confusing at first, because I thought I had more wires than the switch mechanism did, but then figured it out. I'm stoked that I can set a fan to go for a half hour or more at night when I don't need the bathroom to retain any extra moisture (old house, wet climate), and don't want to leave the fan on all night.",
