No problem find the switch now. I had looked at my regular big box store for a switch like this one but could not find one. Amazon had what I was looking for at a very low price. My daughter liked it so much she wanted one for her house, as well. I just installed hers today.",

Also of note, if you want to use the quickwire holes in the back without using the screws, you may not be able to, they are very small. I had to double up wires on one of the screws because of this.

        "text": "This is my second of these switches that I've purchased in the past year. Installed it as the light switch in my garage. I chose the illuminated switch because I don't have windows there, and I was tired of fumbling around searching for the switch in the dark. After about 6 months, the first of these switches stopped working. The switch itself would illuminate, but no matter how many times I flipped the switch, the garage lights would not come on. Troubleshot with a standard switch and the lights worked just fine. Okay, no biggie...things fail. It wasn't too costly, so I'll just buy another one. Second switch was delivered, I installed it. Tried it while still hanging out of the wall by the wires. The switch illuminated, the lights came on when switched. Issue resolved....NOT! Pulled the circuit breaker once again, tucked the wires in, secured the switch and installed the switchplate. Reset the circuit breaker, tried the switch again, all worked just fine. Went in the house and returned to the garage a few minutes later....waitaminnit!!! The switch isn't illuminating! What the...? Jiggled the switch a bit, and it illuminates while in the \"in-between\" position between Off and On, but that is the only time. Now I'm out $10, two switches, that work the exact same way as the original non-illuminated switch. Save your money!",

        "text": "1) The instructions and faceplate both indicate that right side up is with the green ground screw on the bottom right, but THIS IS NOT TRUE. The main photo on the amazon listing shows it right side up (with the green ground screw top left). I hope I can save someone else time and extra wiring. There is no \"on\" or \"off\" label on the switch anywhere. Flipping the switch makes a louder sound and is not as soft feeling as the standard switch I replaced. I prefer the softer, quieter style switch. I included a video for comparison. The regular switch turns on the fan, but hopefully you can still hear/see the difference. When I opened the box, only one of the long screws was attached. At first, I thought the second long screw was missing but then I found it and the plastic screw keeper in the bottom of the box. Just something to be aware of. I wish it only turned on the light when it was dark, but I knew when I bought it that it didn't have that capability. Other than that, it does exactly what I wanted it to do. I have two switches next to each other in the bathroom. I didn't want a night light; I just wanted to be able to find the light switch (and not the fan switch) in the evening without groping the wall, the switches, the blow dryer, etc.",
