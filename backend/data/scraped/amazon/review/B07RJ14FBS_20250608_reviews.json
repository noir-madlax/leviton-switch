Every now and then when you mean to hit just the center button you hit the spinning ring around the outside of it. Not a huge problem but I'm sure other people have big clumsy fingers too.",

        "text": "I have Hue bulbs installed throughout my house, and I absolutely love them. However, my home is outfitted with standard wired switches in every room, which can cause a few issues. While voice control is convenient, flipping a light switch when entering a room often feels more natural. Unfortunately, when smart lights are connected to traditional switches, turning the switch off takes the bulbs offline. This makes them unavailable for voice commands, automations, or routines. Worse yet, it disrupts the flow of controlling all the lights in a room—turning the switch back on only reactivates the power, not the smart functionality. This dimmer solves that problem perfectly. It prevents the lights from being accidentally turned off while seamlessly integrating with the existing wall plate. The design is clean and simple, and the installation is straightforward. I explored alternatives like the Hue Dimmer Switch, but it presented a couple of challenges. Using it would require either adding a separate plate alongside my existing switch or rewiring the wall switch to tie the wires together and then installing the Hue Dimmer over it. Both options seemed cumbersome or overly invasive. In contrast, this dimmer offers a much cleaner and more practical solution. There’s also the Hue Wall Switch Module, which serves a similar purpose. However, it requires dismantling the wall switch and connecting wires to achieve functionality, making it more complex to install. Additionally, the Wall Switch Module only provides basic on/off functionality, whereas this Lutron switch offers multiple features, including dimming and switching between scenes. For me, the added versatility of this dimmer makes it the clear winner. If I have one complaint, it’s the price. While I believe the quality and functionality justify the cost, it becomes a bit painful when you need several of these switches throughout the house. A multi-pack—perhaps a 4-pack with a 20% discount—would make it much easier to outfit an entire home without breaking the bank. Overall, this dimmer is a fantastic solution for managing smart lights in a home with traditional switches. It simplifies lighting control, eliminates offline bulb errors, and offers more functionality than other options. While it’s an investment, the convenience and seamless integration make it well worth considering.",

Also, how do they find the list in the dark? Philips makes wall-mounted controls, but I prefer the Lutron control because it mimics standard dimmer light switches. A person walking into a dark room and feeling this switch will know to push it in and/or turn it. We use each switch to control the bedside lamps in a bedroom. We also provide Hue Wireless Smart Light Switch Buttons at each lamp so that guests can control the lamps without getting out of bed or using their voice. Who wants to issue voice commands to Alexa while someone is asleep in the room?",

        "text": "If you are planning to use it with a Hue hub or bulbs directly, skip this review. I connected it to Home Assistant via zigbee2mqtt, and it’s a mixed experience. First, hardware itself is awesome - it sits on top of the switch and works as intended. But the problem is that it’s stateful. Meaning, if you only control your lights with this device and never through home assistant without this device, it will work fine. But if you change your light state from your HA and then continue using this dimmer, results will be unexpected. It remembers its own state but is not aware of the lights state, and it only sends brightness based on its own state. It doesn’t send click messages or dimming increase/decrease messages, only brightness. So, once you do something with the light from your Home assistant, dimmer state is invalid. I wrote a huge script to handle this. The script remembers last known dimmer brightness and tries to guess what new brightness means - click or something else. If new brightness is 0, it’s the biggest problem- you don’t know if it’s a click or dimming down. Quite possible it’s a click and the user wants to turn the light on if you previously turned the light off with the app but the dimmer thinks it’s on, but could be dimming down as well. There are many other problematic scenarios. I made the script work for most cases but it’s not possible to mitigate them all. I wish the device would just send stateless messages about what was done with it.",

This covers the switch, locking it in the \"on\" position so the smart bulbs always get power. This button sends on/off and dimming signals to the smart bulbs. It does those things flawlessly! Pros: - it's easy to install (non-destructively - it clamps over a light switch with fitting that you tighten with a screw). - it works really well - the lights respond quickly and reliably. - it's surprisingly low profile. A visitor would be unlikely to realize it's anything more than a standard dimmer switch. Cons: - it's pricey - works for Hue bulbs only. I'd like to be able to control Z-Wave, Matter, SmartThings devices, etc. - in case your home network was down, I wish you could pop the dimmer off the wall and change the switch position without a screwdriver.",

        "text": "This is indeed a great idea to mount over a traditional toggle switch. The push on/off and rotary work great. What does not work is selecting “natural light” scene. You can apparently pick any scene, except for that one. Natural Light is the one scene that I most want to use. Apparently that’s a Philips bridge limitation. It was announced over a year ago that Natural Light would be enabled for Aurora switches in 2023…..but it’s 2024 and nothing yet. I guess I’ll keep this, but I’m not sure where I’m going to use it since it won’t work with the scene I use most often.",

        "text": "I bought five of these for my house because I loved that they would let the light switch stay but cover it up. And in the end, the ones I have look great (plus Hue products just work better than any other I have tried with Homekit—always respond quickly if you have a hub). HOWEVER, when you get to the final install step and you push the dial onto the mount, it has to go on PERFECTLY balanced and very very gently. The first one I installed didn't go on evenly, the top locked in and the bottom didn't snap, so i pushed on the bottom and the insides just collapsed in a junk pile of innards. The button didn't push, the dial was uneven. Pulled it off tried again, but now it was clearly straight up broken. Before I returned it, I went to install the others... so I took the dial from another box and it snapped perfectly on the mount both sides at once. Okay, 1 for 2... must be an anomaly, right? Next install, gently, bottom snaps in, top doesn't. Pull it off, try again, collapsed. Broken completely. No button push, no blinking light. Everything crushed in. Pulled off again, tried to carefully \"fix it\". Nope. Take another dial, snaps right on, no problem. Next, broke. Next one after that, broke. Uh oh. 2 for 5. Not good. Sent the three back. But bought three more at a brick and mortar to save time. Two broke, one didn't. 3 for 7. Returned the two broken ones. Got two more, one broke, one didn't. 4 for 8. Next, broke. Took it back again. 4 for 9. Next, broke. 4 for 10. But at this point, I had the last one from the store, so I decided to actually fix it this time. Nope. Not a chance. These are cheap, delicate, and incredibly fragile, so it just got worse and worse, until it was not even returnable. At that point, I gave up on having the fifth at all and just swallowed the money—vowing to never get these again and to write a review to help others decide if they are the gambling type or not. I do love the four I successfully installed, but it was very hard to get there and 100% a game of chance on the dial install—which, of course, led to multiple returns and then eating the price of one altogether. So I absolutely cannot recommend these. It's not worth the risk for me to ever go through this again. However, if you really want the end result and you're willing to go through a potential cycle of frustration and wasted time, you may be happy when it's all said and done. Just don't say I didn't warn you.",

Installed in less than 5 minutes. Within that 5 minutes, it took longer for me to find a Phillips screwdriver than to install the device! You will need to read the instructions just to mount the base onto your existing wall switch. But the rest was a piece of cake. The Hue app even has this device right at the top of the Friends of Hue Accessories setup menu! Overall, I highly recommend it. The Hue ecosystem is already expensive on its own so this doesn't really break the bank.",

It seems like there are at least a couple versions of firmware floating around in the wild, only one of which matches the instructions for pairing. Once paired, they do function well as a replacement light switch, mostly. When I added a new bulb, I had the darndest time trying to get the switch to turn the new bulb on, though it would turn it off just fine. My biggest issue with these switches, besides the cost, is that they don’t really stay attached to the switch toggle all that well. Even when tightened down like crazy, they’re relatively easy to pull off of the wall. Even just tryin to pull the button off of the mount to change the battery will usually pull the mount off with it.",

My only complaint (very slight complaint) is the dimming feature is a little slow to respond so I have to take off .1 stars making this a 4.9. With that said the ease of install and convenience easily adds .1 stars. I give it a 5 out of 5 stars. I only have 1 switch for my kitchen lights so this was a perfect solution to an annoying problem and a heck of a lot easier than changing the switch out. I would definity buy another if I had 2 light switches. A cheaper option is buying a cover to prevent you from turning the switch off, but this lets you have access to turning on and off the lights and dimming them, plus it looks like it was made for this. It does not control light colors but I have Alexa for that (she is spying on me anyway). I was 100% satisfied with this purchase.",

That's all that matters Cons: When you press the central dial with your palm it is easy to accidentally spin the dimmer switch which causes the light to turn back on - albeit very dim. In that case, it's hard to notice that you accidentally turned it back on slightly because its so dim. So much more touch sensitive and squishy than your standard good ol trusty dimmer switch from before this smart bulb nonsense. Please improve this design and this will be a perfect product",

This is great for creating a more relaxed atmosphere in my home. I also love the fact that I can create different scenes with the Aurora switch. For example, I have a scene called \"Goodnight\" that dims my lights and turns on my bedroom fan. Overall, I am very happy with the Lutron Aurora Smart Bulb Dimmer Switch.

If this is you then this Lutron light switch solves that lol I bought one of these for our living room Philips Hue lights just to protect my precious Alexa overlord from not giving me the response i want when i ask the simple question to turn off the lights and prevent a device is unresponsive error message. As an added bonus, it can allow you to synch multiple lights to the dimmer switch so you can dim the lights to a low setting in case you want a more hands-on approach to controlling your lights. Simply put, if you own Philips Hue light bulbs then this is the product you need. If you rent and want to get more fancy in your rental then it's a must!",
