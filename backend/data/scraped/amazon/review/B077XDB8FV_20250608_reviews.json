Yes, it is easy to install, but that's as good as it gets. The light works as expected when used without the fan. The fan works occasionally. Typically, using the fan causes the light and fan to ramp up to high and will not shut off! Following the reset procedure does not cause the fan to stop. The fan just starts back spinning. There is simply no way to stop the fan except to pull the chain! Shutting off the breaker has the same result. Tech support/customer service blames the disfunction on using \"untested\" light bulbs. Unfortunately, \"tested\" light bulbs are impossible to find! Absolute JUNK!",

The dimmer works perfectly with LED bulbs with no buzz. I recommend the Philips Warm Glow because they replicate old incandescent bulbs so well on dimmers. The speed control for the fan is good. No buzzing at any speed. The slow could be a little slower, but that’s a preference Only down side is installation can be tough. It is much deeper than a regular switch, so make sure the box can handle it.",

        "text": "I bought three of this switch from a big box store. Whether it works as intended seems heavily dependent on the particular ceiling fan you have, even more so than the finicky dimmable LED bulbs. In one fan/LED configuration, the switch works fine and has a neat feature where you can hold down the button and it stays on for a little bit to give you time to exit the room before the light turns off. However, with the two Hunter fans I have, using bulbs recommended by the Lutron compatibility guide, the switches exhibit unstable, maybe even hazardous behavior. In one fan, the bulbs dim as expected… until you turn the fan on, and then the bulbs turn off and can’t be turned back on until the fan is turned off. Even worse, sometimes this causes the fan switch to become unresponsive and it is impossible to turn the fan off without using the little pull tab cutoff at the bottom of the switch. The other Hunter fan is similarly unstable with the same exact bulbs (swapped) with the fan on, except with that switch the bulbs will not dim at all. So it is a problem with the combination of the Lutron switch and the fan. But the fact that there is “crosstalk” between the lights and fan circuits inside the switch makes me very uncomfortable having this hard-wired inside my wall.",

They just look fancy than any analog switch and they're more modern. But for the price point, they really need to drop this thing by 20 30% to be able to compete with some of the generics out there.

I hooked it up as instructed, using a brand new hunter ceiling fan and when I pressed the fan button and set the speed to the highest setting, it made a terrible whining noise and the blades barely spun. Pressing the light button, there was an awful several second delay and when the light did come on, it flashed and flickered, randomly going out and sometimes on again. I tried 3 different dimmable LED and all produced the same result. Many reviewers complain of the same issue, so I assume it’s a fan compatibility issue. I’m just not going to waste my time making it work. I’m returning it, but maybe others will have better luck.",
