Quality of the switch itself is there. Looking at the pictures leviton uses to display the illumination and what I got are NOT THE SAME. The light is so friggen dim! Seriously leviton!?? Hard up for a sale? I feel misled and it sucks! Why cant they add a single sentence stating the light is dim? Other sellers do. Im suppoed to see some in the dark w/nightlight. This friggen thing may get me there but ill hit every obstacle on the way. GERRRR! Looks like home depot is getting a good sized return. Back looking for something that's really what it says it is.",

How to fix this: If you where to replace the top half of the switch with a clear see through plastic, I think it would solve the problem. Good news though... I bought this Leviton product and it works great. I really wanted the panel switch but the light emitted from this switch works, well. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K8XFRW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 FYI - I am a verified purchaser of this product and wrote a review, not sure why it didn't show up on this particular page, so I thought I'd added it here too.

        "text": "Look in just about any American home today and chances are the switches and electrical receptacles are made by Leviton. The company has decades of experience in the industry and their products just work and keep working for ages. I started off swapping out the switches in my home to add illuminated switches as a convenience: it’s easy to find a light switch in the dark when the switch is glowing. This almost should be a requirement for all homes, but whatever. The first few switches I installed were cheap, generic switches with a distinctly Asian/Chinese brand name. They worked, but they had an amber glow, and they used a gas tube to generate the light and this had a tendency to flicker. I grabbed one of the Leviton LED switches at a big box store when I needed a 3-way lighted switch, and once I saw the pure white light on these and the nice glow around the button, I couldn’t go back to the orange ones. Yes, these are gonna set you back a bit if you upgrade all the switches in your home, but you shouldn’t ever have to replace these, and the LED should work for years if not decades.",
