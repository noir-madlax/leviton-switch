        "text": "These were easy to install. When in came to the wiring, there seemed to be an extra red wire, which had one end taped up. If you needed it for a 3 way, you could have used it, but we only needed it for one switch. So we wired the ground, the red and the black to our existing wiring and it worked great. One we used to replace an older dimmer that was overheating and the other was a plain switch we added the dimmer to LED lights. The wiring does not have a lot of extra and it's pretty short, so you won't get to strip off much to expose more wire. These also felt very plastic, but they look good and both are working great. The buttons are a bit bulky, I know some of the other dimmers now have sleeker and low profiles, but this is good if you are trying to find the buttons in the dark. It was also very easy to put on the faceplate,. Overall, they work great.",

        "text": "So far, I have installed one of the two dimmer switches in this pack in a bedroom with a single pole configuration. It works well. Within the last couple of years, I have installed three other dimmer switches around the house and these switches are almost identical in design to two of the switches. What is different about these is that they were a FAR better price. I had gotten all of the other ones at big box home improvement centers--where not only where the switches more expensive, but you also had to buy the switch plates separately, which added even more cost. The switches are also UL rated which is printed on the metal part of the switches.",

Since these dimmer switches met all the specifications, I decided to try this brand, My implementation was for single-pole operation. Installation was straightforward because I was replacing an existing switch. I like that these switches do not require a neutral wire because the installation is less invasive. These dimmers operate efficiently with a gentle rocker press, and the dimmer slide works smoothly. There was no flicker when adjusting the brightness. My overall experience with these dimmer switches has been excellent. If you are in the market for dimmer switches, you owe it to yourself to consider this product.",
