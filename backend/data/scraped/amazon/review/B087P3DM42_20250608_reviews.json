        "text": "So the switch so far has been working great. Installation was a breeze (after I figured out my weird wiring), it looks good on the wall, and the switch itself is elegant and put together well. The downside though is that setting this up for homekit was NOT easy in the slightest. If your WiFi uses band steering, and if you have a modern router that only has 1 WiFi network you do, then it cannot connect. You have to have a dedicated 2.4Ghz network for these to connect to, they can't handle steering. They also cannot connect via 5Ghz. I don't know why either. It's not that much more expensive to add a 5Ghz radio and enable band steering, especially for something that will always have mains power.",

        "text": "One thing to note is that the switch doesn't \"flip\" per se, it just sort of \"clicks\" like a computer mouse to toggle the internal electronics/relay. There is an LED on the switch to reveal power on/off vs the physical position of the switch. Also, wiring is via screw nuts to the box wiring as opposed to more traditional terminals. Installation is fairly straightforward provided you have the opposing switch wired correctly, and Homekit integration is seamless. My only serious nitpick is that the faceplate pops off way too easily, sometimes accidentally if the box screw terminals are too deep, i.e. behind the plane of the wall. A more secure snap-on mechanism or even a screw attachment of the faceplate would be a welcome addition in this case.",

        "text": "I installed this light switch to replace the light switch for my front lights. I was going to order a programable switch, but this is simpler and can be adjusted on my phone. The installation took about 15 minutes. The app allows you to remotely turn the switch off and on and set up programs to auto turn off and on. It also has a setting to turn off and on with the sunset/sunrise, which is perfect for my situation. The switch also comes with wire nuts, and a plate so no additional hardware is needed. Connecting the switch through the app was quick and painless.",

        "text": "I bought this due to Homekit compatibility. We has homekit set up but had not gotten around to installing any smart switches or plugs. It was mainly for the Apple TV's we had set up which totaled 8 of various generations. When initially set up it would work with the Meross app and Google Home but not Home kit. What I had discovered was the Apple Hubs were not responding. I am not sure why but since we did not have automation set up at this point, it was fairly easy to start over with a new Home. In doing so, we moved the 4th generation Apple TV to our living room which has ethernet and then re-added the switch. This fixed the fixed the problem. We don't plan on adding a lot in the way of automation but in this case it is very useful. The lights that we wanted to control are of a modern design and dawn to dusk sensing light bulb would not work so this option addresses that. We have other lights that are outdoor lights controlled by indoor switches which are convenient to access from the outside so being able to turn these lights without having to go back inside will be really nice. Now that I know this switch will work perfectly for those instances, I will be ordering more.",

        "text": "I have two of the Meross smart plugs that work very well and had an easy setup. I decided to add a Smart Switch to my Apple HomeKit products. I ordered the Meross MSS510 single pole switch. It was impossible to set up and never did make it work. I attempted to contact Meross Customer support two different ways. No response. I searched their site for answers, nope. I followed the setup guide of the Kasa App. It said I had network issues. Not true, I did a network test and rebooted the network per their troubleshooting suggestions. Network was fine. The Kasa App did not have the MSS510 listed as a product. I wondered if I had the wrong app. I attempted to make contact with Amazon. No luck there either. So, I gave up. I am not able to return the product because it is out of the return timeframe. That is on me. It sat on my To Do list too long. I decided to try the HS200 model. I installed it yesterday It worked. So, my conclusion is that the 510 is not compatible with the Kasa App that I already had for the Kasa plugs. Bad purchase documentation, setup instructions and support . Nowhere to get clarification.",

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to come back downstairs to turn off the kitchen light because it wasn’t smart controlled. I always found smart switches compatible with HomeKit to be pricey until this switch from Meross. I’m so happy to finally have all my lighting connected and controlled through HomeKit.

Over time, it would stop communicating with my network, which would require me to do a power off reset of the switch. It would work after that for a few more days or weeks, and then would go offline again. I contacted Meross tech support but they were of no assistance. I just pulled it out of the wall and replaced it with a TP-Link Kasa switch. I have had trouble with both the Meross wall switch and with the smart outlets, but so far have had no trouble with the Kasa. Not recommended!",

        "text": "UPDATE: Meross immediately and kindly reached out to me after I posted this review to offer a refund. That is kind! I was motivated by that to change my rating from a one star to a two star review. I provided them with the additional attached photos and hopefully can contribute to an improved design! I am grateful that they reached out to me. I compared their switch to a standard manual switch for their observation. I own a lot of Meross products and they would usually get five star from me but this one just didn't meet my expectations. It is comforting to know that Meross proactively stands behind their products and I will continue to purchase Meross devices! ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have a case-ground system in my home. Everything is conduit and BX. When I installed this switch into an UL approved metal box, it seemed very tight in the switch box. When I turned the breaker on, it tripped. I discovered that the switch black \"line\" wire had been compressed against the BX connector nut to a point that it cut the insulation and shorted to ground. My box is standard electrical hardware. Meross needs to come out with a newer version and relocate this wire to a place where it won't interfere with box hardware on a case-ground system. Needless to say, it's going back to Amazon. Shame. I had no problems installing two Meross non-Apple Home dimmers.",
