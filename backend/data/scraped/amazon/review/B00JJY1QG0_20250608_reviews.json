I put the device into non-dimming mode since the Ikea lamps have custom non-dimming bulbs and used a simple on/off Pico. You have to find the Lutron “advanced instructions” online to learn how to do that. So I’m wasting the dimmer capability, hence wishing Lutron had a cheaper device. But still, this is a useful device",

I hooked this up to some LED garage shop lights to turn them on and off. I also have one for the lamp next to my bed which has a 200W LED bulb that I can dim and turn off and on with my phone or the Lutron remote while I’m in bed. I use Lutron dimmer switches throughout my home. Started using them in my original 3-story townhome so I wouldn’t have to run up and down stairs to turn off lights that I’d forgotten to turn off before going to bed! Saved my knees. I also use Lutron’s geo fencing to automatically turn off lights when I leave home and to turn them on when I return.",

        "text": "I have long raves about these wall switches and wall outlets. They more than pay themselves in new construction or remodeling by not needing to have three-way switches installed. The Pico remotes can be programmed to control multiple devices. And multiple Picos can control a single device. That said, when the wall outlets are powered off, they still leak a tiny bit of electricity. This is not a problem for major brands like Phillips, which get warmer as you dim them, but for several foyers I have 1W dimmable LEDs which provide perfect illumination in these areas. I installed these wall outlets and thought these small round LED bulbs were from the same manufacture but they are not. One bulb turns off completely. The other stays on like a tiny nightlife. I swapped them out both plug in outlets leak a bit of power to this particle bulb. As there is no flickering, I like this unintended nightlight function, and the rest of these outlets I previously ordered turn the larger wattage of Philips LEDs completely off, thus much of the issue is that this one brand of 1W LED bulb is hypersensitive to the tiny leak of current that still flows when the plug-in outlet is turned off. Again, I highly recommend this product and only experienced this issue from all these dozen plus outlets in two homes with one brand of a 1W LED.",

This, however, was a failure at first, until I tried many bulbs to find one that would dim less than 50% brightness. I purchased this to replace my manual dimmer switch and to have HomeKit control. This just does not operate as good as the actual wall switches, but it gets the job done. What I had to use is a Feit 100w vintage LED bulb which lets me dim pretty much down to a 5% brightness level. Any other dimmable LED bulb with a lower wattage just didn’t work right or flickered.",

Because of the price we are slowly transitioning one room at a time. We also have the bridge and the coverage seems to be very good. Because we have a larger piece of property we split our Internet into two networks so that we could put a separate bridge out in the barn to control those lights and have one in the house. I think that is a huge benefit of the Lutron app being able to have it operate in two different locations on two different networks names. I forgot to mention you can only need to use one app and you can switch between the two. It takes a while to get through to customer service but they are extremely helpful when you talk to them.",

        "text": "As a retired electronics engineer I appreciate the technology that went into these simple home automation devices. They look good, and work well, BUT, they have one fatal flaw. They do not seem to have any protection against short circuits! A fast tripping breaker, even a fast blow fuse would be a simple thing to add. While passing out Halloween candy to kids, one of their costumes tipped over an incandescent walkway light, and caused the two poles of the filament to touch. POP goes the $50 Lutron switch, taken out by a shorted $0.50 bulb! Adding short circuit protection would cost very little to Lutron, and would make this product bulletproof. Consider doing that Lutron, as I spend another $50 for a replacement. The replacement will connect to AC through a fast acting surge protector. That might save me another $50 should something like this happen again. BUT, better to fix the cause than address the symptom, right, Lutron.",

        "text": "I started using Lutron back in 2015. The application is perfect for organizing and programming the switches to work with each other in a multitude of ways. The ability to add switches wherever I need without adding wires is fantastic. Also there is a sensor you can buy that automatically turn lights on and off, you can also have the light auto turn on at any level of light. Handy for late night trip to the restroom. Now in 2022 the world has changed from indecent lightbulbs to LED lights. Unfortunately Lutron has not updated their hardware to work with LEDs making them not only useless but annoying as LEDs burnout much sooner than they should, blink insensibly, or will not turn off at all (just blinks). Contacting Lutron they act like that is not true - they have a list of lights that work - a list? First sign of a company that has stopped updating their hardware. Do not buy. Modernizing your lights with smart switches is very expensive and needs to work with todays LEDs. With Lutron you are investing in obsolete hardware.
