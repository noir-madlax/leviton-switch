I will be returning this item because it just worries me too much, and that is something I never had to do before. As an electrician I just do not feel comfortable using this product. 1. You can just feel the difference in quality between this switch and any other rocker switch. It weighs close to nothing and feels cheap 2. The rocker switch has no resistance when you push it and feels mushy 3. It doesn’t snap like a normal switch to on/off. You can actually very easily put it in between on/off and that really worries me 4. The switch is only rated to 6amps. I need it to control LED lights and even with LEDs it doesn’t take much to overload that 5. It isn’t UL listed, it is ETL listed but any quality products are almost always UL listed in the US",

These work well and are priced where I would expect them to be. I had the other less expensive ones you see more often, and these are way better for the look, feel and function. These have only one adjustment for minimum brightness, the other brands had adjustments for both min and max.",
