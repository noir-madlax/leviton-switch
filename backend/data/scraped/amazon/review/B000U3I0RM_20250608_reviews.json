        "text": "I needed this because the switch for my basement lights in in the kitchen, near the door to the basement. I have a 150 year old house and plugs and switches aren't always in the best places since they weren't there when the house was built. The result is, I wanted to make sure I have turned off the basement lights without having to walk across the kitchen and open the basement door every night. This does the trick. When I turn out the kitchen lights, I can clearly see the light on the switch if it's on. No more forgetting the lights if I'm interrupted in the middle of a project and don't get back to it. The only issue is the one expressed by others here: the light leaks through the switch itself instead of just the indicator lens. It wouldn't be so bad if it was just fall off glow into the toggle, but this looks like there's dirt inside the switch. I had to come back here to see if that was how it was made or if mine was defective. I somehow missed those other photos. Very sloppy workmanship. Overall, I like the functionality, but if I find another rocker option from another brand, I'll probably replace it or I'll see about taking the cover off and coating it to block the light bleed. Right now, I've only seen other options in a toggle style, which definitely won't go with the other switches.",

The lamp isn't overly bright, but enough to get attention if you look at it. Most of the switch itself glows red if the room is dark, making it very noticeable. It does require a neutral wire for the light to work. The switch can be back wired with 12g or 14g solid wire.",

        "text": "Love having this to tell me if the light in the garage or the attic is on. It does require you to add a white neutral wire in order for it to work. Notes from GSM GSM's review: Wiring this switch is more than simply moving the existing wire connections to this new switch. The existing switch will have 3 wire connected to it: hot (black wire), load (black wire), and ground (bare copper.) You also need to add a jumper (white wire of same gauge) so that there is a connection from the silver screw to the bundle of neutral wires that are bypassed in a normal switch box and typically pushed into the rear of the switch box. You also need to determine which of the two black wires that connect to switch you are replacing is hot and which is the load. (Easy to do with an electrical meter, make sure you exercise proper safety practices.) Wire as follows: BLACK SCREW > HOT (power from electrical panel aka breaker box) BRASS SCREW > LOAD (light fixture or whatever is turned on by the switch) SILVER SCREW > NEUTRAL (white wire, you will need to add a jumper of SAME GAUGE wire to bundled neutrals in the back of switch box) GREEN SCREW > bare copper GROUND wire I also found the wiring diagram to be a little confusing and give credit to those who made the same summary I did above. A normal single pole switch will function correctly regardless of which black wire (one is power/hot, the other is load) is connected to which screw on a single pole switch. However it matters with this switch and if you get things turned around it will not function as intended. If you flip the above wiring so that black screw is the load (light fixture) and brass is to hot (power from electical panel) then the red indicator light will be on all the time. To get the functionality of the red indicator light on when, there needs to be a connection from the silver screw to the neutral (white) wires, which are normally bypassed in a switch box. They are usually pushed to the back of the electrical box (either twisted together or joined with a push-in wire connector.) I was lucky and there was an open channel in the push-in connector and I also had some electrical cable lying around and cut an 8\" segment to connect to the silver screw the the bundle of white wires.",

Also the pilot light is easy to see during daylight hours, within a reasonable distance. Can be seen at farther distances after dark. This switch is installed in a residential environment.",

The red light only lights up when the circuit is on and that is what I was looking for. Minus 1 star because the red led light makes half the switch glow through the plastic, it really makes it look like a cheap switch (and come on, this is a Leviton 20 Amp Decora switch). Leviton could have made the plastic opaque or thicker or something so the pilot light showed just through the red lens.",

The only bit that I'm not crazy about is that the light doesn't just come out of the lens but rather the entire switch which is the same issue as the standard switch in the middle.

Perhaps the trouble some folks have is they don’t have a neutral in the switch box? Often times in existing wiring there is a line and a switched leg, black and white, with no neutral. Just sayin’.",

        "text": "I grew up with Leviton being The Name in electrical gear... no more. This switch isn't worth a damn. The back mounts won't hold a 12ga conductor no matter how much you tighten them. The switch action is very vague and sticky - not crisp or firm in any way. The \"light\" is not visible in daylight from more than 4 feet away and at night, it lights up the whole top of the switch. And finally, the whole thing is able to be twisted while tightening the screws after giving up on the back mount - very \"plasticy\"... This thing is a piece of junk. Unfortunately, you cannot know some of this until you begin the install - at which point you just want to get is done and over with... Had I known (or read), I would never have bought this switch and very much regret doing so. Next time, I will stick with the tried and true toggle...",

I needed a switch which would indicate at a glance if the circuit it feeds is on, as the fixture is some distance away and not visible from inside. Included instructions were clear and understandable. Much simpler than adding a separate indicator light in line near the switch. Would purchase again if need arises.",
