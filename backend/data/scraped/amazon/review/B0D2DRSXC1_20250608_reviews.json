The problem if you have small electrical boxes is that now you need to at least 3-4 connectors inside to connect them, Leviton already taking up a lot of room in the box, so I have 2-3 1 gang fittings where these simply don't fit. All their previous gear had screw connectors, kind of sneaky since they don't seem to call it out on the box either.",

The English language one was available on the Leviton web site though. The wire leads on the switch are long enough for most applications but I would have preferred traditional screw terminals for a cleaner installation but I'm sure the wire leads help keep the cost down. Overall it's fine as a basic z-wave switch. It doesn't seem to support any kind of multi-tap functions (like Zooz devices) but for an on-off switch it works fine. The current rating for LED lights is considerably higher than alternative products as well which was my main reason for buying this model.",

Then, tried to install it in a 3-way and that does not work since I didn't have the companion switch. Then, installed in another room.. Pairing is very fiddly with Smartthings are seemed unreliable at times. For something as simple as a light switch I expected a lot more from Leviton, and a lot less expensive...

        "text": "Leviton was my go to brand for my home automation Z-wave switches and dimmers. NOT ANYMORE. I have purchased Leviton Z-wave ON-OFF switch model ZW15S. Switch will not turn off at times when bottom of the paddle is pressed. Its a random thing. I have powered the switch off-on with breaker and performed reset to factory default. Neither helped. Thinking this may be one odd defective switch I have ordered replacement. New switch will now do complete opposite and will not turn on at random times. I'm an electrical engineer by trace and I can assure you that it is not a wiring issue. Z-wave connection and control worked fine. Manual paddle control does not. Although I have not experienced any issues with Leviton z-wave dimmers this is no longer my go to brand. Makes me think where they make these switches nowadays.",
