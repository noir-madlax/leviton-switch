        "text": "I'm thinking i might have received a Returned item. Had a weird \"burnt\" plastic (circuit board) smell. Used one and worked fine. Hooked up a bathroom heat/vent/light combo. One switch i hooked up the vent (to one switch) and light (to other switch). Then installed the other switch on my main bathroom light and wired in the heater portion, that way I don't max out the amperage on one circuit. At first the second install, i had put the \"line\" to the brass screw and the \"loads\" to the other switch's (heater and light respectively). Turned on the breaker then one on the switch and both the heater and light came on. It baffled me for a good while. I rechecked all my wiring in the gang box and in the attic for the heat/vent/light combo. All wiring was correct. Then i went out to Lowes to buy another, Eaton, hooked it up and i did the same thing. So i decided to read the instructions very carefully. It stated, \"to run the single pole double switch as two INDEPENDANTLY switches, break off the copper tab between the two loads!\" That was the KEY! i looked on the Eaton switch and this one and sure enough on the load side, there it was. I took my flathead screwdriver, small, and wedged it in per the instructions and a simple up, down, and back up again then the tab broke off. Now it works fine. How i know this was prob a returned item? The first switch i installed, i didn't have to break the load tabs off because someone else did it for me! They work great now after about 2hrs of troubleshooting, climbing up and down from the attic, turning on and off the breakers to switch the line wires around ect...The single pole 3 switch didn't have the break off tab so idk what gives? It's not like this is or was a 2-way switch configuration. But in the end, lesson learned and experience / wisdom was gained.",

It looks so ugly and I decided to repair it with this one gang dual switch. The two gang box was removed and one gang after work switch box was installed successfully. However, I waited more than a week with the wires open live for this dual switch. The dual switch price is very good but the switch has never arrived and I reordered today. There is a negative feedback on the switch on or off position not known but it is on the same bathroom and it is on or off is obvious that I do not care.",

        "text": "These dual-rocker switches are easy to install in a decora-style face plate, offering simple push-to-flip operation. My only real complaint is about the color coding of the terminals. Anyone who has done electrical for years knows that the green screw is ground, the brass screw is hot, and the silver screw is load/neutral. These units eschew this convention entirely, using black for hot and brass for load/neutral and ground. This is only a problem if you start wiring up the brass side and THEN get to the other side and find out you have to start over. Luckily, they are well-labelled (in English anyway). There is also a pre-installed jumper plate on the common/hot side, so that you don't have to wire the power in separately if the two loads are on the same circuit. (If they are not, a quick flick of a screwdriver or pliers can remove the tab.) The low cost makes it a worthwhile purchase, though.",
