I downloaded the app and was able to easily connect it to the switch. As the instructions and others have stated, it needs a 2.4 GHz connection to your router (if you have a dual band router, you, or someone you know (friend or service provider), will probably need to split the WiFi bands, which refers to separating the 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies on a WiFi network by assigning different network names (SSIDs) to each band, allowing devices to connect to the band that best suits their needs. The switch saw and connected to Alexa right away with no problem. I’m using this with LED bulbs and haven’t had any flickering, as some people have stated. I installed this over three months ago and it’s still working great.",

        "text": "My child has a horrible habit of never turning off lights which bothers me to no end. In addition, my laundry room light switch is behind the door making it irritating to turn on or off when my arms are full of laundry. For those reasons, I had 2 requirements 1) a light switch with a motion sensor for my laundry room & light switches that I can control wirelessly/remotely. To accomplish this, I bought multiple different types of Kasa switches. I was able to install the motion sensor light, but because the motion sensor is on the switch itself & the switch is behind a door, the light kept shutting off at the worst times. I was going to just live with it because I was going to install other Kasa light switches, but when I went to install the other switches, I uncovered a large issue that prevented me from installing the Kassa switches. Unfortunately, Kassa switches require neutral wires which didn't work with my house that was wired in the early 2000s, without neutral wires. I researched like crazy to find switches that are wireless, do not need to connect to a hub that is plugged into my wi-fi router, and do not need a neutral wire. My research lead me to this GE Cync switches. So far, I have installed 2 dimmers, 1 switch paired with a remote sensor, 2 switches I configured as 3-way switches, & 3 other standalone switches. I also have 2 more dimmers & additional switches I have yet to install. I found the installation of the switches to be pretty easy. I have little electrical experience, but after installing multiple Cync switches, I am able to install a new switch in under 15 minutes. As soon as I install a new switch, I immediately connect it to my wi-fi. After getting each switch connected to my wi-fi, I then configure all of the switches at the same time in the Cync app. I did have a few hiccups with the Cync app when I configured the first couple of switches, but if I kept the app open, the lights would connect to it after a minute or so. I also had to restart the app a couple of times, but all in all, connecting the switches to the app was pretty simple. What's nice is when you are configuring the switch, the app tells you to look for the flashing green light on the actual switch so that you know exactly which switch you are configuring (super helpful when you are configuring 3-way switches). One thing to note is that you must first set up a room & add your appropriate switches to the room. If you have multiple lights in that room that you want to work independently, you must create a group in that room for each independent light (e.g. My 3-way switch is in my hallway. I set up my hallway as a room & put both switches in the same group so they work with each other. My kitchen has island lights & an over the sink light. I set up my kitchen as a room & put my island lights in 1 group & my sink light in another group... if I hadn't done that, even when I wanted just my sink light to turn on, both my sink & island lights would turn on & off at the same time, regardless of which switch I turned on or off). Now that the switches have been configured in the app, my lights work great using either the app to control them or the switches themselves. Another thing to note is that in homes with older wiring, your lights may flicker after installing the switches. There is a light bulb adapter that comes with each switch & if you use that adapter with your light bulb, the flickering should stop. The downside to the switches is that they are pretty spendy... especially if you must purchase the switches that do not require a neutral wire. The Kasa switches are much more reasonably priced, but again, the Kassa switches all require a neutral wire. However, when all is said & done, if you watch the price of these switches & are able to get them for under $30, I feel they are well worth it! Every time I find them for under $30, I buy as many as I can with my goal being to have either one of their dimmers or one of these switches in every switch in my house!",

The included bulb “adapter” that screws underneath a bulb on the circuit and meant to increase load in said circuit to remedy flickering does not work at all and seems to increase flickering. The flickering wreaks havoc on bulbs and I’ve lost several LEDs and CFLs since installing just a few months ago due to the heat associated with these types of bulbs and the flickering. The instructions say there are specific bulbs from GE that will work but I didn’t know that ahead of time and I refuse to be pigeonholed into buying more things with the hope of it working. I’ll be buying an alternative product and taking the hit from this purchase. Awful product. Don’t buy.",

        "text": "I’ve tried and tried to like these switches. I got excited when I came across a well known brand that produced a smart on/off switch without the need for a neutral wire. I have an older house without neutral wires to the switches and for a while the Lutron Caseta dimmer switches were all I could find that worked. I have a few of them and have had little to know issues. They work great, but are expensive and I don’t need dimmers for a lot of my switches. I bought multiple no-neutral Cync switches and have had issues from the get-go. First off, installation is hit and miss. Some I installed easily and some took multiple tries before I could get them to set up properly. Next, a “room” HAS to be created for the switch to be set up. The issue with this is that if you have multiple switches and want to group them together in a room but work independently, good luck, it won’t work. Every switch you put in a room will trigger all switches in that room every time you try to use the switch to turn things on/off. So every switch has to have a separate room if you want them to work independently, which is annoying but not a huge deal. Next, the WiFi connection will come in and out constantly, regardless of how close to your router you install them. I researched a ton and found that they only work on a 2.4Ghz, and if you have a dual-band router that can’t be set to only use the 2.4Ghz channel the switches will struggle. Even with a 2.4Ghz range extender I still have connection issues so that won’t completely fix the issue. There is a WiFi indicator but you leave the indicator on, it will blink on and off every time it loses connection and gains it back (which is pretty much constant). They come with little adapters that supposedly help them function properly, but they are bulky and often get in the way if trying to install in a smaller space like an outdoor sconce. Even then they don’t work consistently. I have uninstalled and reinstalled switches over and over, so if you are considering these switches look elsewhere. I promise the activation of them outweighs the cost of better products out there.",

I haven't had luck with it working at all, it disconnects from the WiFi a lot and turns on and off and emits a hum, so I started reading more into it and they only intend this to be a light switch. I'm guessing that's why it has been not working and flashing my led lights that are plugged into the switched outlet. Due to the very specific caveat and from reading other reviews people have problems with them using them for their intended purpose, so for that reason I'm going to have to say these are a 2-3 star.",

After multiple resets, retry attempts, leaving it hanging out of the wall etc., I finally figured out what it was doing. These have some sort of bluetooth mesh they can switch to, and no matter what I tried these switches would randomly change from wifi connection to the bluetooth mesh and back. This switch was part of a basement group, on the 'storage' circuit. So, if you turned on the shop light, and this light was connected to the mesh, the storage light would also turn on. After a few minutes it would reconnect to the wifi and turn itself back off. If you turned the storage light on and it was on the mesh, either the shop and/or laundry area light would come on.. then when it would reconnect to wifi those would turn back off. I got so frustrated I put the standard switch back in this location, then noticed the other two would act up occasionally even without this one, although not as frequently. I bought another brand and those work fine in all 3 locations. Going to try to return them all, but because they were installed I'm not sure Amazon will take them back. These are JUNK, do not buy.",

Rather than spend thousands to rewire the house with neutral wiring, I chose these switches that don't require a neutral. Great WiFi reception because they will automatically BlueTooth thru each other to get connectivity from one that has better WiFi. Great compatibility with Alexa and Google Home for automations and routines. Only had one issue with a bulb that needed the included adapter. App is user friendly and allows for customizetion of bulb type used. I have 8 currently on the network with 2 more to be installed soon. Clean design and easy to install.",

        "text": "I have one light switch with no neutral, and all the other main light switches connected to Kasa smart switches. There are a few options of Smart Light switches which do not need neutral lines, but none are more economcial than the GE Cync. In fact, it's less than half of the Lutron Caseta and dims as well. The switch only has 3 lines, so it's just like hooking up a dumb single pole switch. Hold down the power button to trigger the setup mode, and start up the app. The light is up and running in a few minutes. It offers extra settings like turning on and off at sunset but I'm not interested in that so can't attest to it. It also comes with an addtiional light socket that screws into your traditional socket to allow dimming of bulbs. I have an LED attached so didn't bother. All I wanted was a smart switch I can turn on and off with Alexa. This fit the bill perfectly and has beeen working flawlessly the first couple of days. Using Alexa allowed me to mix and match this with Kasa lights for group routines as well. I am very pleased at this relatively inexpensive smart switch. I've seen reviews of other people saying the light stopped working or started giving them problems after a short while. If that happens I will update this review. But for now, I am thankful for this thing.",
