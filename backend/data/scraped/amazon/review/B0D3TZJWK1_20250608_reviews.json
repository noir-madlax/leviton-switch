They work reliable for a couple of weeks now. The cover plate is a bit odd as it is made to snap on without any screws showing. This is fine if they are used in a single gang box but maybe not if you want the screw free look in a 2 gang or larger box. The one little issue we noticed is the dimmer is somewhat limited in the dimmer function of around 25% at the lowest setting.",
