I installed both switches, but one of them wouldn’t work at all. I rewired it 4–5 times, consulted ChatGPT, and even went to Lowe’s to get a voltage tester, thinking maybe it was an issue with the wiring or the electrical box (even though the lights worked fine before). After several more rewiring attempts and reinstalling the old switch, I gave up and called Amazon. They gave me a refund and sent a replacement. The new switch arrived the next day, took 10 minutes to install, and worked immediately—so yeah, turns out I was sold a dead switch. Thanks for that.",

I tried: A 2.4GHz-only network (even disabled 5GHz), Older routers, Multiple resets and power cycles. Each time, the switch broadcasts its default Wi-Fi, and the app claims \"connection successful\"—but it's not. I have to manually connect to the switch’s Wi-Fi, enter my own Wi-Fi credentials, and then it just spins for 10–15 minutes before saying “pairing failed.” and keeps blinking orange and green. I've restarted everything (including the switch and router), reinstalled the app, and even tried different phones—same result. It just won’t connect. This has been a huge waste of time and money. I normally like TP-Link products, but this one is a complete disappointment. Avoid it unless you enjoy endless setup loops and frustration.",

The initial one was a little difficult to install but that's just an issue on my part. I have 12 total Kasa smart switches in my house and all work great. Installing two more torrow and hope to install 4 more soon in addition to the Kasa thermostat. Good value for the money as you can see. The Kasa app is easy to use as well and I have had no problems getting the switches to work in the app. If you get an Echo product to go with the switches it makes it even better. Being able to remotely turn off those pesky lights your children left on while trying to run out the door is amazingly convenient. I have had no connectivity issues unlike other reviews. I have a good router and plenty of WiFi coverage in the home so it makes me wonder if the issues with the other reviewers were that they didn't have good coverage in their homes. The dimming feature worked flawless as it was able to dim lights i didn't even know could be dimmed in our home.",

I am not an electrician but know a little bit and it took me about an hour to install however my current plugs were quite disorganized. I am sure it is much quicker to install but regardless anyone can do it with a little time. Seems to hold up well, I’ve had them for almost a year now with no issues.",

        "text": "Update 04/12/25: I was able to get this figured out; this was user-error (Dunning-Kruger). I shouldn't have chosen a two-gang junction box with such a huge bundle of wires in it to get my feet wet with trying to wire in smart-switches. I was trying to wire in the black hot wire into the bundle of black hot wires, but this was wrong. The correct configuration was to just wire in the two black wires coming from the smart switches into the existing two hot wires (and one to the existing ground wire, of course), then unscrew the wire nut from the massive existing bundle of neutral (white) wires, then wire the two (white) neutral wires from my two smart switches into that bundle. Viola, everything worked flawlessly, although I had barely enough to room to jam all that into the junction box. OLD: I checked the description of this product carefully since I have experience with successfully wiring two smart thermostats to three separate air conditioners. I also work for a smart / IoT device company (that involves wiring) in a troubleshooting department, so I felt very comfortable taking on this task myself, although I have only done rudimentary 120v projects. I took off the light switch cover and examined the wiring before making my purchase. Mine had one neutral, one black (hot / line), and one ground, plus one huge bundle of 6 - 8 black (hot / line) wires and one huge bundle of 6 - 8 neutral wires. I photographed the existing wiring to make sure I could return to the existing wiring (just in case). I didn't see anything wrong because the description only mentions requiring a neutral wire, but would later discover it requires two black (hot / line) wires. The existing two switches each had one black, one white, and one neutral connected. They did not have two blacks connected as expected. The wires were connected to a giant mess of wires featuring two huge wire nuts of 6 - 8 white and 6 - 8 black wires each (respectively). First I just attempted to connect the switches as close as possible to the old switches, but this did not work. Flipping the breaker caused the switched outlet connected to a lamp to just flicker and the ceiling fan not to respond. The two smart switches just flashed orange and were unresponsive. Finally, I found the hot wire in the bundle of black wires using a voltage tester, isolated it from the rest, then bundled it into a wire nut with the secondary black wire coming off each switch. Same result. I tried a few more variations, but nothing would work. I'm flying blind on how this junction box / room was wired. I understand the way this junction box was wired is not TPLink's fault, but what is their fault is installation was billed as \"a breeze\" and the requirement of the black wires are happily glossed over. I could have saved 6+ hours of troubleshooting if they had put in the real requirements (two hot/line, one neutral). It seems like TPLink is okay with making some customers miserable wasting their time rather than put in the description how difficult it is for many customers (which you can do an internet search on, which you'll find my issue is not uncommon).",

The other things you might want to have are Wago wire nut alternatives which make installation very easy when you have a lot of wires or you are putting in more than 2 switches in a box. I also recommend outlet spacers. The 5-way splicers from Wago are ideal when putting in 4 of these. Wire all grounds neutrals and 1 of the blacks from each switch together outside of the box. You connect the ground, neutral and supply once, then each light/fan and you are done in the box.",

        "text": "If you are running a Mesh WIFI network, with just 2.4 & 5ghz, this switch will not connect, even when you turn off the 5ghz. If the mesh network has 6ghz capability, turn off everything except the 6ghz and then it will connect. After connection, you can turn the 2.4 & 5ghz back on and won't have a problem. If you don't have 6ghz capability, I'd go with a different manufacturer. Otherwise this switch has worked great!",

If you are thinking about it just get them. My only downside is that I need to keep buying and installing more every time I remember a light switch that isn't smart.",

However, my home was built in the 1970’s and I had to swap out the old 2 gang electrical box for a $5 new one because the switches were too recessed and the cover plate wouldn’t snap on. Changing out the box was easy and I think it’s just an issue with 2 gang boxes being smaller in older homes. I have several Kasa plugs and those have been easy to set up and problem free, so I think that it’s a good brand for an Alexa household.",

He called the company and spent several hours on the phone with them twice trying to get it connected. They finally agreed that their item must be faulty and said they would replace one of the switches. Then they sent us an email saying that we had to register for their warranty to get a replacement. Then they proceeded to tell us that we had to pay the shipping for the replacement item. No acceptable! We are returning through Amazon and will never purchase from this company agagin!",

The setup is extremely simple and I found the integration with Alexa was very smooth and they are my go to switches. This set has a specialty cover plate that ensures the two switches sit in perfect alignment and are flush giving a great finished product over using a conventional cover plate and having slight alignment issues with individual switches. While I don’t have an issue these switches are not a conventional on or off type switch but function as push type switches. When off the switch has an illuminated symbol showing it is ready to be operated, when on the symbol is off. I will be purchasing additional Kasa switches as I expand my smart home.",
