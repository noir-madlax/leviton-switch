These match the rest of my switches, can be used in a three way configuration, and have a trim dial to help with LEDs and CFLs. I have installed two of these one on LED can retrofits on my porch (the switch is indoors) and one on an LED island light in the kitchen. The rest of these are for LED can retrofits in the basement. Also, they have back wire (not back-stab, back wire). I love back wire. Easy, easy, easy to swap switches in the future without cutting more copper.",

Took out one of the 8 watt LEDs and replaced it with a 50 watt incandescent bulb. Flickering gone. I have no idea why this works, but it always does. I gave it four stars because this is not uncommon, and I have no reason to believe that purchasing a different brand of LED dimmer would be any better.",
