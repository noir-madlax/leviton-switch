Unfortunately since the switch was purchased as used good it would not connect to the bridge. After contacting customer service I was able to reset the switch to factory default and get it to connect. I am controlling nine 85w equivalent LED flood lamps with this switch with no problem at all. No flickering and I can go from 1% up to 100% brightness. Just remember to update the firmware in the bridge and the switch using the Leniton app for best performance. The quality of the switch is very good. I have it paired with the remote companion so I can control the lights from the top or the stairs without going into the basement.",
