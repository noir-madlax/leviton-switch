        "text": "I‚Äôm pretty frustrated with this brand all around. I updated my previous home with a competitor brand but chose to give this one a try as it‚Äôs much more affordable. I started with a 3 way switch and a fan/fan light switch. I was able to get both connected to my google, but both dropped. Really frustrating. The 3 way switch is so basic and right next to my WiFi, so no reason for it to drop. What‚Äôs worse is when they do drop, you can‚Äôt even flip the lights on manually. Whenever I did have connection issues with previous brand, you could at least still turn things off and on manually. Not super time consuming to swap out switches, but to do so, get them connected to your smart home, have it fail and have to remove and reinstall basic ones, ugh‚Ä¶.don‚Äôt waste your time. Really wanted to love them.",

There are two other manual switches in the 4way setup that are mostly used. Not surprising though as the switch is very cheaply made. All plastic. The internal switch still works when toggled with HomeKit or another manual switch. Replacing with Lutron which are a lot more expensive but are solid. Also this switch tends to disconnect from the network anytime a wifi AP would restart. Would have to press the little button on the switch for it to rejoin. And occasionally would have to set it up over again in HomeKit and the meross app. Always updated the firmware.",

        "text": "I have tried a few different 3way wifi switches, Homekit specific, and these meross 3way switches simply work out of the box with easy setup. Others are a lot more expensive and have weird wiring or require a special paired second switch. These clearly show how to wire travelers, neutral, live, and ground and work. Pairing is straight forward, and they consistently reconnect without repairing on wifi reboots. My first two lasted 2 years and 3 years respectively. I tried a couple other brands, but I still cannot find anything better. So I just got two more meross switches again. I do hope they last longer this time. Side note: I really hope they eventually come out with Matter over Thread though.",

I found this and one from Kasa. this was the only one which worked with homekit, so i went with it (this is also listed on the apple website). Electrical installation was straightforward. I have a standard wall junction box with a neutral, so it was just a matter of making sure i kept the common wire labeled. Everything connected without an issue and tucked into the box. Setup in the app was weird as you have select the correct version, but version options provided didnt sync up with the label on the box. I selected one (guess) and homekit was fine, but it didnt install in the app. I started over (removed the switch from homekit) and tried the next option. This one worked as it completed the install in the app and then automatically finished the homekit one. a little odd, but worked in the end. i have it for about a week and so far, no issues. i do have a weird issue where sometimes the entire circuit will turn off or encounter a power hiccup, but i do not believe that is this switch as it has happened when i toggling the 4 way dumb switch. WiFi is lost with the this switch, but i am happy to say within a few seconds, the switch is back online. Overall, i like the switch.",

        "text": "I like these Meross light switches. They install easily and are very easy to connect to your network. They work on WiFi and don‚Äôt need a hub. You do however need to download the Meross app and create an account. It is free. You connect all of your different types of Meross devices, then on your Amazon Alexa activate the skill and you can do voice commands. You can also connect your Meross account with SmartThings and it works great. Another great feature if you use the three way switch like I do is that you can just leave your second (or third) switches as they are. You don‚Äôt need to purchase a second ore remote switch. This saves you money and makes installation much easier as you only change one of the switches‚Ä¶ your choice of when you want to change. These do look like up and down toggle switches, but they really are just one push button at the bottom. In other words, you press it like you‚Äôre turning it off all the time and it toggles between on and off. You get used to this quickly. I‚Äôve also had other switches that work with the toggle up and down, and some that feel more substantial when you press them, but they can be triple the price of this one. I‚Äôve had quite a few of these Meross switches installed for years, and have only had one fail. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to use them. I still give them 5 stars.",

I installed it to see how it would function and was pleasantly surprised with how well it worked and integrated with Apple Home. The Alexa integration was not nearly as easy and still does not work well. I planned to return it on principle since I am offended at being sold a used device as new, but decided to suck it up and keep it since it is installed and working. I don't plan to order from this company in the future based on this experience and will give one of the many competitors my business for my next purchase.",

Homekit integration is also poor but it could be something with Homekit itself. Very slow to respond to 'hey siri' commands.",

        "text": "This is a copy of my review of the single pole version of these switches. I have been replacing my light switches with these Meross smart Wi-fi wall switches. I got a few to try them out and see how well they work as a replacement for my smart bulbs. The smart bulbs (3 different brands, including the supposed expensive good brand) would keep loosing connection. They would be unresponsive more often than not. I was getting so tired of Siri \"not hearing back from the device\" so I decided to make the switch to smart switches, and boy am I ever glad I did. No more problems with loosing connection since I started using these! Also, some really cool features are as follows: If you are replacing a 3-way switch setup, you only need to replace one of the switches if you use these smart switches. You can set up an automation to make it so that the lights switch off automatically after a set amount of time, or you can make it so that whole groups of lights come on if you switch on one etc. You can use this functionality to effectively make unrelated lights work kind of like they are part of a 3-way light switch. Maybe best of all is there is no longer a problem if somebody switches off the light switch (unlike the dumb smart bulbs that get completely screwed up if somebody accidentally forgets and turns off the switch). I also like how I can decide on a per-switch basis, if I want the little indicator light to work as a night light, a power indicator, or to just stay off (this functionality is accomplished via the Meross app, and that's about all I have used their app for so far, it's easy to add your switches to the Meross app if you have finished setting them up in homekit first). So far I have found these switches to be very reliable. Setup can be done completely through homekit and it works pretty seamlessly. Out of 12 switches so far (both 3-way and single pole) I have only had one that had any hiccups while trying to set it up, and after resetting the device, setup went smoothly on the second try. Please note, these switches require the neutral wire, so they won't work if your house doesn't have neutral wires in the switch boxes. On a side note, I noticed that amazon \"clip to save\" coupons pop up every day or so with these, so don't buy them all at once. Buy them one set per day so you can keep getting that coupon each time!",

Very easy to install except make sure u take a picture of the switches so you get the correct number in case you need to reinstall then you won‚Äôt need to open the wallplate. Installation through meross app is required. Hopefully it works directly with homekit app. All the homekit app compliant switches are lot more expensive than alrxa compatible ones. Meross app is easy and automation via homekit app is easy. I could set the appropriate lighting to turn on or off when the main door is opened or locked etc. However apple home kit is a different story. I have my iPad at home as the hub so I can remote access. Almost everyday when I try to use the HomeKit app it says the switches are ‚Äúupdating‚Äú. Takes a while to go online. Probably because it is trying to reach the ipad hub but not sure. Expected better from an appli app. That‚Äôs the main disappointment.",

It powered up fine and connected to WiFi, HomeKit, etc. But when I pushed the button or switched it in HomeKit, my lights would flash twice, then glow dimly continuously and never turn fully off. Obviously this was not what it was supposed to do. I disconnected it to keep my house from burning down and emailed customer service - the ONLY way of contacting them. TWO DAYS LATER I get an email response asking for pictures of how I had wired it‚Ä¶ as if I had just left it there for two days waiting for their advice. DO NOT BUY THIS SWITCH. Poor quality, even worse customer service.",
