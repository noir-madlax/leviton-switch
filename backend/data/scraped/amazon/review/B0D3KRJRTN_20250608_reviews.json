        "text": "I’m really impressed with the ELEGRP Dimmer Switch, Touch Dimmer Light Switch. It has a sleek, shallow profile compared to the dimmer I replaced. The switch operates smoothly and has a modern, elegant look. I also love that it remembers the last dimmer setting when you turn it off and on. The build quality feels just as good, if not better, than the more expensive name-brand dimmers that look similar. Plus, there’s no flickering of the light. It comes with a decorative plate, though I didn’t use it since my previous dimmer was installed in a duplex J-box. Overall, I highly recommend this dimmer switch for anyone looking for a quality, easy-to-install, and user-friendly option.",

We've been doing an update to all of our new home's light switches to make them a cleaner rocker/decorator style. I like that this switch comes with the plate, and the whole look is clean and modern. The dimming function works really well and the fact it can be installed single pole and 3-way makes the decision to order that much easier.",

The on/off switch part has a nice soft click to it when you press and lets you know you pressed it enough to turn the light on or off. I love the touch slide dimmer function, very cool! No mechanical slider to mess with. But remember you absolutely MUST have a neutral wire in your light switch for this to work, whether in 3-way or single pole mode. So open up your current switch and check for a white neutral wire before you order this switch. Easy to install, comes with everything you need but a screwdriver.",

I didn't use the 3 way feature, so I just capped that wire off. There's no sounds when clicking the switch on and off. In order for the dimmer function to work your finger needs to be on the switch and on the dimmer part for it to respond. Took me a second to figure that out. You install a plastic mounting bracket, and then the face plate clips on to it. It gives the exterior a nice smooth look without seeing any screws",

Installation was very easy but if you're not comfortable dealing with high voltage electrical lines, hire an electrician. Once installed, you're greeted with a slick, small LED light bar that runs vertically along the right side of the rocker switch. To brighten or dim the light, just run your finger up or down the light bar. That's it. Very cool. Turning the light on is almost like other rocker switches. I say almost because you can't just push the switch anywhere. I find it works best when you press the top left or bottom right of the switch. Even with that slight quirk, this touch sensitive dimmer switch is great. It also works as a night light because the LED light bar is always illuminated showing the dimming percent.",

It looks nice, but doesn't match anything else in the house. (And in most of cases, the switch is going in a multi-switch gang anyway.)

The UL certification was on the back of the product but it was in the form of a sticker. I would rather see it embossed on the product but I will accept this as it is. Its capabilities are just like any other wall switch controlling up to 450 watts incandescent or 150 watts LED. I have the three way version which I can install both as a single pole or a three way switch. Cheers",

For the value it is of good quality and is holding up fairly well!",

Also this switch requires a white neutral wire which most of the time is not run through a light switch wall box. You also must have the necessary wires run between the two light switch wall boxes. This is a good looking well made light switch. The cover plate fits nice. The unit comes with good instructions.",
