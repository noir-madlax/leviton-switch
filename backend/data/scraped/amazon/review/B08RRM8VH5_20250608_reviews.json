The app is intuitive and offers a decent level of customization, including fade speed control and LED indicator settings. The fact that they gained Matter support through a simple app-based firmware update is fantastic and future-proofs them nicely. Just a word of warning: I received older, 1st-generation switches in boxes labeled for the newer 2nd-generation when I ordered \"Like New.\" It seems someone engaged in a switch-and-return scam. While the product itself is great, be wary of \"Like New\" listings.",

        "text": "This is an exercise in frustration, can’t recommend. First you have the issue that you probably can’t just remove the switches and replace them because you need a neutral and most switches won’t have one. If you are lucky the neutral is at least in the box, if not game over. Then just when you think you are done, you point your phone at the QR code to connect and it tells you to contact the homeowner to get it to work. Wow, not helpful. Then you go through their app. Their app at least seems better than the Kasa app, but I wanted the switches to work on Apple Homekit. After more than an hour I still have only two of three working on that app. It should be as simple as point phone at QR code, but that tells me to wait for an extended period of time then gives up.",

Set up is also super easy, wire switch, click add device to Apple Home app, scan the QR code and you are in business.",

Unit is not too bulky so it’s easy to fit into the box. I used the Leviton app first. App detected the dimmer via Bluetooth and I added it to the app without issue. The app has a few additional controls like max/min bulb intensity. Then I added the dimmer to Apple HomeKit on the first try. I can control dimmer intensity through HomeKit in addition to on/off. Satisfied with purchase.",

        "text": "Reviewing \"Dimmer\": Replacing old WiFi dimmer in Master Bedroom. My critical feature was that it would dim low. My previous WiFi dimmer would dim until the bulbs (all dimmable LEDs) would cut out. Newer dimmers don't seem to do that - even when adjusted to their maximum range. I bought two new ones previous to this; one dimmed to maybe 30%, the next to maybe 20%, this one I would say went to 10%. I decided that was the best I was going to get and was acceptable. Besides that aspect, this is a great dimmer - definitely the best of all I tried. I like that it is a push top to turn on, bottom to turn off switch (dimmer adjustment is on the right). I really like that the locator light when the switch is turned off is very dim (some are just too bright for a bedroom). The instructions and software are top par, very high quality, and the software allows for a lot of adjustment and customization. The only issue I had was with Matter. I did the software update and got it hooked up, but it kept disconnecting from Alexa. I didn't pursue a fix to this and instead opted to hook it up to Alexa through the app - which worked fine and no disconnecting issues since. If you're looking for something basic and/or if being able to dim very low is not important to you, you'll find other products on Amazon that will do the job decently for less money. If you are hard set on Matter, read a different review, but if not and you want top of the line and are willing to pay for it, this is a definite buy.",

They disconnect from the internet and randomly turn lights on and off. There is no way to keep the switch in the off position so I had to unscrew the bulbs from their sockets (the switches control recessed ceiling lights) until I could replace the switch. I attempted to reset the switches and to update the firmware, but nothing works. I replaced two switches, but I think I will go back to the good old reliable mechanical switch as replacements as these things continue to fail. It appears that the problem that I am having isn't unique to me as many others have reported the same issue. If you want smart switches I recommend looking at brands other than Leviton.",

        "text": "I purchased this switch based on a strong recommendation from a relative who has dozens installed with no issues related to connectivity or reliability. Setup was straightforward, but my experience took a drastic turn when I attempted to add the switch to HomeKit using Matter. Firstly, this switch does not support Matter out of the box. You are required to enroll in a beta program and install beta firmware on the switch to enable Matter functionality. Even after doing so, I encountered persistent issues. Despite numerous attempts to connect, including resetting the device, restarting my router and phone, and trying every troubleshooting step I could find, the switch simply would not pair with HomeKit via Matter. After some research, I discovered forum posts suggesting that Matter requires a 2.4GHz-only Wi-Fi network. I have a Google Nest Wi-Fi Pro router, which doesn’t allow disabling specific Wi-Fi bands. It's worth noting that I have several other Matter-enabled devices from different brands that connected seamlessly without needing to adjust any network settings. I even exchanged the switch for a new one, thinking I might have received a faulty unit, but the problem persisted. Leviton's claim that this switch supports Matter is, in my opinion, misleading. You’re required to A) sign up for a beta program, B) install beta firmware, and C) have a router that allows disabling specific Wi-Fi bands—all of which other brands do not require for their Matter-enabled devices. In summary, if you’re looking for a seamless Matter experience, this switch is not the way to go.",

It was SUCH a pain to install, having to change my wifi source, and then every few months it would disconnect and I'd have to go through the whole process from the beginning. When it failed a few days ago, I uninstalled it from my wall and threw it across the room. I knew there HAD to be something easier and better. Leviton was a brand known for reliability and so I bought this one. Installing it was like night and day compared to the other one. The instructions were simple and it just worked the first time with no drama or having to change my wifi source. It connected perfectly to Alexa and my Google Nest app too. I wish I had found this switch several years ago, it would have saved much aggravation.",

My one complaint with Leviton is that their iOS app currently does not directly integrate with HomeKit; you have to add the device to both (if you want firmware updates from Leviton). Also which they would just adopt Thread...would be a game changer. CHECK PRICING AT HOME DEPOT.

All I had to do was to reset the router. Resetting the router got all the switches to reconnect to Wifi at once. In the My Leviton app, I went to the \"...\" of the device -> Device Settings -> Device Health -> Check for Firmware Update. Upgraded to version 1.6.4 and don't seem to have any issues now. After that, I didn't have any issues. My Leviton seems to work with Google Assistant just fine. Nice to have these light switches set up for my \"Good Morning\" and \"Bedtime\" routines. They don't disconnect from both the power and Wifi when someone turns off a light switch like the smart LED light bulbs do, which is great.",

        "text": "TLDR: This is working well with Matter and Home Assistant over wifi; if I have any issues with reliability I will update. Note: I have many Zigbee \"gen 1\" Leviton dimmers DG6HD. They are still (mostly) my favorite excepting two things, 1 they seem to be at least softly discontinued, not advertised anymore and hard to find in stock, 2: the D26HD supports double tap to max brightness, which the Zigbee DG6HD does not have. Because of these 2 reasons, I reluctantly tried the D26HD and find it an acceptable alternative; however, I'd still prefer a Thread or Zigbee-based version as D26HD requires a My Leviton account, access to your wifi, access to your precision location on your mobile, access to your wi-fi password, and Internet access, and is harder to set up than Zigbee switches for those who know what is Zigbee and have a Zigbee hub. If you want Matter you have to use My Leviton to set it up first, opt into Matter early access, and upgrade your firmware. This was \"easy enough\". Not as easy as Zigbee you click one button in Home Assistant and done though. The Zigbee versions also allow access to fade in/out timers, but Matter mode does not, at least in HA as of writing this review; however, you can configure it via My Leviton app. I have not yet tested if the device works when restricted from the Internet in Matter mode. I use this with the DD00R companion for multi-location dimming. I did not want to use the \"anywhere\" battery-operated switches so utilized existing multi-pole wiring. Wiring is standard. Compared to DG6HD's screw terminals the D26HD uses pigtails -- some find this as a pro, some as con. The DD00R is compatible with the double tap to max on / off, which surprised me since it was made for gen 1 devices that don't support it; HOWEVER, if you double tap the DD00R quickly it recognizes as a single tap while on the D26HD it works perfectly. Using remote control via My Leviton and via Matter through Home Assistant appears instant. I opted to use My Leviton as little as possible so I use Google Assistant integration via Home Assistant instead of My Leviton. In Home Assistant Matter only the on/off and dim level is supported, which for me supports all everyday use case. In My Leviton you can change bulb type, min and max dim power levels, and fade on and fade off time settings in 0.5 second increments and upgrade firmware, which is a \"one time\" expected use for me. In general, I am anti-wifi for smart devices due to the lower reliability I've typically witnessed and inappropriate for battery-powered devices, but as a wired device it is OK enough, although if Leviton drops cloud support you lose the advanced configuration functionality. I still prefer the privacy-centric features and cloud-free Zigbee DG6HD, but again they seem to be on the way out. A great improvement will be when Matter comes out-of-the-box so you can enroll it without Internet or My Leviton, and if the advanced features can be supported (if possible) via Matter.",

Also added it to a couple of different scenes (activities), one of which allows me to turn it on dimmed in the early morning hours.

        "text": "Product originally got hung up with some Amazon nightmare where it wasn’t shipped yet but I couldn’t cancel it either, sat like that for about 2 weeks. I eventually bought another one which arrive the next day (really?!). The original one finally showed up the day after the second one arrived. What a pain Amazon. Anyways, the product was in mint condition and packaged well. The dimmer switch had clear and easy to use instructions compared to the competition (great job there, as tech items usually seem to fail in this department). The installation was easy and when it came to linking it up with Apple HomeKit, it was a breeze. Happened right away when I restored power to the switch. Had it for about a week now and never lost connection or have any issues with it directly. Now, that being said, the dimmer switch is great, but like many smart dimmer switches they have glitches with your existing lighting. Like flickering and jumpy step dimming. I have both problems and I want to add, since I have experience with many types of these switches, it’s not really the switches fault. Years ago I found out if you buy cheap LED lights (even though you think you didn’t…you have) you will have some glitches. Now, I have some led lights that I spent almost twice the price as the majority of other lights in my house, they did not have any glitches, they worked smoothly and flawlessly. So maybe keep that in mind. I personally don’t mind the glitches, because I’m saving a fortune using cheaper led lights, I really don’t mind, because when you have over 50-100 led lights in your house, expensive led lights can break the bank fast. I also want to add, that I’ve been using this companies products for a few years now and I really like them compared to the rest. I like the controlled dimming ability and the integration with Apple HomeKit. I recommend this product to my family, friends and all who read this review. Happy shopping!!",
