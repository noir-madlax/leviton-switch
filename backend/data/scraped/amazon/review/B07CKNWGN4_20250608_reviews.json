        "text": "I really wanted to like these switches. They do exactly what they're advertised to do, and they do it well. After using them for a few months, I've decided I don't like how touchy the dimmer function is. It's not a physical slider, you slide your finger up and down the center to dim the lights. The problem is, to keep from dimming the lights every time you turn the light on or off, you have to press at the very bottom. I try to remember, but every other type of light switch requires no forethought other than turning it on or off, and that's what I'm used to. If they had a lockout feature for the dimmer, I wouldn't have a problem. I'm going to to replace them with plain old smart switches and upgrade my Led's to smart lights.",

        "text": "This Dimmer Switch is a fantastic addition to any smart home setup. Installation is straightforward, making it accessible even for those who aren't particularly tech-savvy. The switches integrate seamlessly with Alexa and Google Home, allowing for convenient voice control to adjust your lighting effortlessly. One of the standout features is the TREATLIFE app, which provides additional customization options. You can set schedules, create lighting scenes, and adjust brightness levels, all from your smartphone. This flexibility enhances the overall user experience, making it easy to create the perfect ambiance for any occasion. Another great aspect is that you don’t have to connect it to Wi-Fi for it to function. This means you can use it like a regular light switch, which is perfect for households where not everyone wants to engage with smart technology. Even without the smart features enabled, the switch operates effectively and reliably, ensuring your lights can be controlled as usual. The dimmer function works smoothly, allowing for precise control over lighting levels, which is particularly nice for creating a cozy atmosphere in living spaces or dining areas. Overall, it's offers a great value for upgrading your home lighting while providing the flexibility of smart features when you want them. It’s a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to enhance their smart home experience!",

        "text": "I have several of smart Treatlife single and 3 way switches installed and all work fine. Wanted to swap a single pole to get a smart dimmer. Ordered first and installed correctly (used amp meter to check) and it did not work. Returned for another (thinking my bad luck) land installed again correctly per directions again using amp meter to make sure. Did not work... after i clamed down I REVERSED load and line wires and it now works fine. Major problem with paper instructions and labels on the switch wires. I noted that Amazon said Often Returned, now the reason is clear. They shot themselves in the food with crappy instructions.",

        "text": "I checked out several options in the store for functionality and aesthetics and this dimmer switch is simply the best. Actually, I took a chance buying this on Amazon and not being able to try it out first. But, one of the options I was hoping for but wasn't sure about was can you touch (not press as in button press) the button and slide your finger up or down to set the dimmer. And, yes you can. It is a capacitance touch to set the dimmer. To turn it on and off simply press the bottom of the switch and it will turn on/off. Interestingly, you can set the dimmer level without the light being on. It has several LEDs on the switch that light as you slide your finger. I didn't really need the APP control but that is nifty if you want to control with your phone. I simply love this switch and will be buying a couple more.",

Have been using TreatLife in two houses for at least the last 5-6 years. The old method of pairing would have the extra step of the switch broadcasting a temporary WiFi network, then would shift to the house WiFi. Now, by the time you hit the “+” in the SmartLife app, the device has already been discovered, and after you have one device already connected in the app, you no longer have to select your network and input the credentials. It’s the little things that make the difference.",

        "text": "I bought a 4-pack of Treatlife single pole switches and 1 Treatlife dimmer. They worked fine, pairing with the Tuya app and working through Tuya with Home Assistant. All 4 of the single pole switches died within 2 years. The dimmer failed after 4 years. In all cases, they wouldn't connect to the app, and trying to turn the switch on manually failed. The LEDs on the switch would just flicker. When electronics are built with very cheap components, they just don't last. I expect things like light switches to be functional long-term.",

It works extraordinarily well with the Alexa app and I really like how you can change so many settings to work with different types of LED bulbs. I removed one star because the push button action is kind of a pain in the butt. Remembers the previous setting but if you touch the touch sensor then it might adjust that setting. Then you have to readjust it and then sometimes when you're trying to turn the light on or off it adjusts the setting again. That aside, if you just plan to use Alexa to control it, it works flawlessly.",

        "text": "As a dimming switch, the product works great, looks modern, and is intuitive to use. As a smart switch, it’s very terrible. Their app experience is poor and something has simple as logging in is painful. Most people will just connect them to their Alexa, Google or Apple homes however that is also glitchy. On google all my TreatLife products show as “offline”. So controlling them with your voice flat out does not work. Their software systems seem to just be poorly maintained. If you’re in the market for smart switches I highly recommend you find zigbee or matter products. These connect to a server (hub) in your home instead of a server in China. You’ll get more privacy, security, and can still hook the hub up to the internet and control them with Google, Siri, Alexa. But this way your data is only exposed to US big tech instead of both US companies and shady Chinese companies",

        "text": "I have been buying this brand for the various remodels I have done for homes over the last 4 years. I had minimal and fixable communication and flicker issues that were annoying, but eventually sovable. Now, they either cheapened the parts or the batch of 20 (yes 20) or more are a disaster. Flickering, one room turning on another room, total inconsistent phone adaptability and a few thousand spent on trying to figure it out with my certified electrician. Customer service was initially responsive but then the passed me off the tech support...IN CHINA...VIA EMAIL ONLY. That is an impossible feat. They have a two year warranty, but my efforts to have it honored are moot. I want the money back (hundreds of dollars) so I can buy a proper switch/dimmers. I do not need a replacement for them, I already spend time swapping this location for that as well as removing them from the WiFi etc. The fact that I am having the issue accross the board on almost all of the units indicates that replacements are a further investment in installation that at this point would be an unreasonable solution. So I am stuck eating all costs involved and replacing for the homeowner. I will continue to review the many many units I have purchased from this company until they decide to refund me my purchases within the last two years.",
