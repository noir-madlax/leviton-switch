Yes, I should have bought a switch when all I needed was a switch, but at the time the sale made the dimmer a cheaper option and didn't realize it would be an issue. Lesson learned.",

        "text": "Switch is defective and I'm not the only one who has had this issue after digging deeper to solve my problem. Goggle it and you'll see. Light switches were working fine for a few months when randomly I would go into the room and find the light was on and thought someone left it on. (Not the case.) When i went to turn it off i would have to push the button twice for it to turn the light off. Thought that was weird too but never really looked into it deeper because its a room hardly went into. However I went into the room today and randomly the light turned on all by itself. When I mentioned this to my wife she told me she finds the light on all the time. When I contacted Amazon about the issue I was told it is only warrantied for 30 days and I quote by customer support \"we can not make any exceptions\". Nonsense! She was not rude in anyway, nor was I. The switches were cheap, Less than $40 bucks for 2 of them. I will not be buying any more Amazon Basic switches or for that matter Amazon Labeled products again. If you cant stand behind your product and certainly for more than 30 days, then its not worth buying. Junk switch.",

        "text": "Overall, it does what I expected it to. I installed mine in tandem with a standard wall switch. A few things to note: 1) If installing using a standard switch as the other switch, you may not choose which light switch it replaces, the smart switch MUST replace the load switch (connected to the light fixture), and you MUST make a minor modification to the way the standard switch is wired. I didn't realize this when I ordered, and was not able to position the smart switch at the most convenient of the two switch locations. 2) The instructions include a wiring diagram, but unless you are comfortable and familiar with identifying which wires in your walls are what, you may have difficulty. It is not as simple as red-to-red, black-to-black. In my case, red had to go to a black wire, brown went to red, and so on. 3) Overall, the switch functions as I'd expect, with the exception that when set below 75% and the light starts in OFF with the switch DOWN, the standard switch must be toggled on and off twice for the light to turn off. Above 75% brightness, the standard switch functions as normal, and if the light is ON with the switch DOWN, the switch functions as normal. Its odd, but not a deal breaker. I even tried a replacement smart switch, but experienced the same behavior. See my video demonstrating the quirky behavior. You can find a very helpful video on youtube if you search for the video titled \"Correctly Install Amazon WiFi 3 Way Smart Switch\" by The Home Improvement Channel",

        "text": "-------- Another update April 2025 Fantastic when it works but it is an unreliable product. Every few weeks it stops responding to Alexa. I try once or twice per day to go through the set up procedure, after 2 or 3 days it will reconnect and work for another few weeks. Next time it happens I'll only try to redo the setup on one of them. I moved a WiFi (amazon EERO 6+) access point and get full bars on my phone near the switch. Echo Dot on the dresser next to the switch reports Good signal and a download speed of 97 Mbps. I am a handicapped senior and being able to ask Alexa to turn on the light when I have to get up in the middle of the night is an excellent use case for these products. ------- Stopped responding to Alexa Feb 2025 After 7 months I knocked off two stars because both switches stopped communicating with Alexa. I tried everything I found online. Technical support said they would process a refund, which would have been nice but an electrician costs more that the switches to install them. Turns out they never did issue a credit probably because it was too late. They did not seem to have any inclination to troubleshoot. Nice product but evidently they are unreliable. ---------- Just bought it in Aug 2024: I like it. It took 5 min to install the first one and about 2 min for the second. I especially like that I didn't need another unvetted foreign app on my phone to use it. When Amazon comes out with their branded dimming lamp plugs, I throw out or give away the ones I use now. Letting Amazon set up the device on shipping meant all I had to do was come up with a better name than \"first switch\" and assign it to a room. The only downside is dimming LED lights is ..uh.. non-linear. The difference between 5 and 10% is greater than 50 to 100% but it was the same for the dumb dimmer switches they replaced. I believe it is a featurew of LED lights. A suggestion to the software geniuses at Amazon: it be nice to be able to use light meter app on my phone to calibrate a lumen output to dimmer percentage. --------",

Problems solved and the product works great as a very cost effect addition to my Amazon ecosystem... I would prefer to move to all Matter-based products but so far that isn't cost-effective. __________________________________ I was excited to be able to use the smart switch on just the satellite box (where the load line is) but you have to have the hot line in both the main and the satellite box for this to work. I either missed that or it wasn't in the product description.",

Only upon wiring it the way it is outlined in the manual can I get it to work…somewhat. Wiring it the way it is outlined in the manual will cause the unit to throw a fault. This will allow the lights to turn off and on, but upon dimming, will have the Amazon switch turn off, and only upon cycling power to the switch will it come back on. Even if dimming is not used, the switch will eventually shut down if it notices the fault for too long. ***Confirmed circuit is correct; works with original Lutron 3-way dimmer switch, and simple 3-way switch. Bulbs are not LED, and a 60W, 120W, 180W, or 240W load, will not change the outcome. Tried a second, new, set of Amazon Smart 3-way Dimmer switches, same deal.",

        "text": "Update: the next day I was able to make changes in the settings—changing the type of device and the brightness. Not sure why the Alexa app locked the settings for this device only although verbally or physically pressing the buttons on the switched worked. I was also able to setup a routine. I updated the overall rating from 1 to 2 stars. I’ve never had this problem with any devices I’ve setup—nearly 100 devices. I have 50+ devices I’ve set up for home automation and this is by far the worst. Thought it would be the easiest since it is newer and is using the MATTER standard. Once I got it configured it is now locked so I can’t make changes—such as selecting the switch as a light is grayed out. The Alexa app won’t change the brightness yet I can change brightness with voice or the physical switch. You would think an Amazon Basic device would work the best with Amazon Echo app. Nope. And I can’t create a routine. I can’t select options. And lastly other devices that worked well are having issues…ever since installing and configuring this switch. I will NEVER buy an Amazon Basics switch again. I will go back to the trusted brands I have used for a decade without issues.",

        "text": "I was a little leery that the online description as of 04/06/24 said this switch uses just one traveler wire. 3 way circuits always have two travelers. But I wanted to check it out their innovation as I have Amazon plugs and Echos in my house. I have also installed multiple single pole and 3 way smart switches from other brands. I know how to wire two travelers, I've got neutral wires, and my existing setup had two working standard 3 way switches that functioned just fine. BTW, the included instructions showed a different wiring setup than the one in the product description. Unfortunately, neither worked for my setup. 5 stars for innovation reduced to 1 star for execution. The positive: once it was hooked up, Alexa did automatically sense the switch, connect to WiFi, and add it to My Devices. The negatives: I was never able to get the switch to function as designed with my LED fixture, the Amazon switch, and a standard switch in the circuit. I am assuming this may have something to do with the low power draw or the dimmer function (not likely, I know). In the best wiring configuration - I tried them all - I could turn the fixture on and off from the Alexa app - but once I used the standard switch it turned off and would only flicker on briefly when I flipped the standard switch. Also, when the fixture was lit it buzzed (search for the other brands that use the technology that eliminates this). No shorts, not incorrect wiring. I disconnected all the wiring, started from scratch, and used an NCV and a meter to confirm the continuity on each wire. Same results. I swapped the smart switch with the standard switch just in case I incorrectly identified the \"load\" side. Same results. I put the old standard 3 way switch back and everything worked with no buzz. Insanity is trying the same thing over and over with the same results. So I am returning this switch and suggest that if you are using a single low power LED fixture and a standard switch you try a smart switch that accommodates two travelers in its wiring, doesn't need to be on the \"load\" side, and doesn't cause buzzing.",

        "text": "I recently purchased the Amazon Basics 3-Way Smart Dimmer Switch and I have been extremely impressed with its functionality and ease of use. As someone who has been slowly converting my home into a smart home, I have tried out various brands and products, but this switch from Amazon Basics stands out as one of the best. First and foremost, the installation process was surprisingly simple. I was worried that I would have to hire an electrician to install the switch, but with the help of the detailed instructions provided, I was able to do it myself in just a few minutes. The switch does require a neutral wire, so make sure to check your wiring before purchasing. Once installed, I was able to connect the switch to my WiFi network and link it to my Alexa device without any issues. The 2.4 Ghz WiFi connection is strong and reliable, and I haven't experienced any connectivity problems or delays in controlling the switch with my voice commands. The dimming function is one of the standout features of this switch. I love being able to adjust the brightness of my lights with just a simple voice command or through the Amazon Alexa app. It's a small but convenient feature that adds a touch of luxury to my home. Another great aspect of this switch is its sleek design. The white color blends in seamlessly with my home decor, and the compact size (2.91 x 4.65 x 1.62 inches) means it fits in standard wall box. It also has a soft LED indicator light that is not too bright or distracting. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Amazon Basics 3-Way Smart Dimmer Switch. It's a high-quality product at an affordable price point, and the fact that it's from Amazon Basics gives me peace of mind in terms of its reliability and customer service. I would highly recommend this switch to anyone looking to make their home a little smarter and more convenient.",

Tell Alexa to turn it off, it turns of for a second, then pops right back on. sometimes it takes 3 or four tries to get it to turn off. Please note, keep your packaging as I threw mine away as soon as I thought it was working fine. I'm ordering a new one to try again as I have had good luck with Amazon products in the past. This time I'll keep the packaging.",

I never spoke with a person who was any help. This is a 3 way switch , with only one traveler wire? How do you hook up two traveler wires, which to my knowledge is how all 3 way switchs are wired, so they can work. The instructions even mention two traveler wires, in the beginning of the instructions, but talk about only one traveler wire at the end. Look at other 3 way switches , and their instruction show 2 traveler wires and have a place to land two traveler wires. Not sure how anyone has got this to work correctly? It also mentions that this smart switch has to be in the box that has the load wire, or it will not work. All the requirements were followed, but never got it to work correctly. GOOD LUCK if you buy this for a 3 way application with a dummy switch on one side.",

I followed the instruction which tell you to have this switch go to the lights not the standard switch. So my issue is that the non smart switch works sometimes. Other times you have to switch it a couple of times to get it to turn off the light. The other thing is the dim feature. At low the lights flicker sometimes. Also twice the light has turned on without anyone telling it to. I would probably recommend trying another brand but it was too much work to swap this with another one for me.",
