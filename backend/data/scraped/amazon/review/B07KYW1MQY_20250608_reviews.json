Installation was simple and straighforward, but when I went to dim down, about halfway down the lights just went off. If I left the slider slightly above that cutoff point, the lights would go out in a few minutes. I have since replaced the unit with a different manufacturer, and my lights are woring fine from top-to-bottom of the dimming range. So, either it was a defective unit, or it's just poorly constructed.",

        "text": "Hopefully this helps someone if they run into the same situation. The switch I was replacing had three black wires attached to it and no ground wire. I wired this new dimmer according to the directions. The dimmer worked fine, but when I turned it on it shut down all of the other lights and outlets that were on that same circuit. And even when the dimmer was off, the other lights on that circuit were not at full brightness. After a lot of research and attempts to fix the issue, it turned out that I had to combine the existing hot wire and one of the other existing black traveler wires with the black wire of the new dimmer to make the whole thing work. That allowed the dimmer to work by not cutting off the rest of the circuit, and for the power to not have to travel through the dimmer when the dimmer was off. Outside of that, the switch works fine, although the slide switch seems a bit touchy when adjusting it.",

This one does a nicer job and the dial that allows you to set the minimum is a nice feature. Now, it will only go as low as I set the dial vs trying to find the dimmest setting possible each time I want to turn it down. However, it does seem to make some of our dimmable LED bulbs hum when below 50% or so. I don't know if that's due to the bulbs or the switch, but I don't recall the old switch doing that. It's a very quiet hum that you have to almost stick your ear to the bulb to hear, but it is audible a bit further away when our HVAC fan shuts off.",

I didn’t have any my clients to call me back for this dimmer Actually this only dimmer you can adjust brightness on low position & it is very helpful specially for led dimmable bulbs . because you should not dim to led to the very low position that is why your Led lights it would flickering. Because not enough voltage reach to the led I think most people they don’t know how to setup this dimmer Here the tip 1-Turn lights on 2- Bring slider all the way to the bottom Then turn rotate adjustable on the side until lights come on keep to low dim you like 3-. Make sure select dimmer not on the very low brightness . (Idea to dim the All Led only %75) Remember led is not old fashion incandescent bulbs you were able to dim all way to % 99",

        "text": "This Maxxima 3-Way/Single Pole Dimmer Electrical Light Switch has the worst dimming range of any LED dimmer anywhere. Think of it has really having only two settings : dim and full on. If you try to balance the slider in the middle, you get flickering badly. I thought it might be the LED bulbs, then swapped out to some expensive Edison style dimmables that are smooth using a Levitron dimmer, and it's like night and day. I really was hoping to get a LED dimmer under $15 for a bathroom that is mostly unused, but this would be embarrassing to have somebody try to use this low quality \"Dimmer\". Back to Amazon it goes!",
