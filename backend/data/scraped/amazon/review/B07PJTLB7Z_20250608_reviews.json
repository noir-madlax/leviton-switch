I get home late a few nights a week, and I don't like my indoor cats to be in the dark but also hated turning lights on at 5am for 12-14 hours later. Now I turn them on through the app or set a timer through the app and never have to think about it. It's great and I highly recommend these lights.",

I have many problems after installing these switches with a professional electrician, I installed these switches throughout my house and they turned on and off normally, but when I wanted to do dimmer in the living room, they dimmed all the lights in the house. I contacted the seller's customer service and they did not give me any solution since the products have a big factory problem. I already solved the problem by buying other switches from another brand but the TREATLIFE ones are going to the trash so the time to return them has passed, stay away from this product, look for something different from this brand, this was my experience and I would not want anyone else to have this problem. Ojo, no les recomiendo que compren estos interruptores, son de muy mala calidad. Yo tengo muchos problemas después de instalar estos interruptores con un electricista profesional, instale estos interruptores en toda mi casa y se encendían y apagaban normalmente, pero cuando quise hacer dimmer en la sala, atenuaron todas las luces de la casa. Me comuniqué con el servicio al cliente del vendedor y no me dieron ninguna solución ya que los productos tienen un gran problema de fábrica. Ya solucioné el problema comprando otros interruptores de otra marca pero los de TREATLIFE se van a la basura así que ya pasó el tiempo de devolverlos, aléjense de este producto, busquen algo diferente de esta marca, esta fue mi experiencia y no quisiera que nadie más tenga este problema.",

I like the appearance but the only way to set them at a consistent brightness when turning them on is in the app. People not familiar with this switch get confused when turning the switches on and off since both actions just require pressing the down function. My guests also change the brightness accidentally because it can’t be locked to stay at a certain level. The button functionality could be better. It’s not a deal breaker but there was nothing to win me over either. There is no built in timer but works great with smart home devices. It responds quickly.",

Additionally, the indicator light is NOT customizable like with their other switches. If you like to sleep in the dark and don't want a night light shining 24/7 then this switch is not for you.

        "text": "This Dimmer Switch is a fantastic addition to any smart home setup. Installation is straightforward, making it accessible even for those who aren't particularly tech-savvy. The switches integrate seamlessly with Alexa and Google Home, allowing for convenient voice control to adjust your lighting effortlessly. One of the standout features is the TREATLIFE app, which provides additional customization options. You can set schedules, create lighting scenes, and adjust brightness levels, all from your smartphone. This flexibility enhances the overall user experience, making it easy to create the perfect ambiance for any occasion. Another great aspect is that you don’t have to connect it to Wi-Fi for it to function. This means you can use it like a regular light switch, which is perfect for households where not everyone wants to engage with smart technology. Even without the smart features enabled, the switch operates effectively and reliably, ensuring your lights can be controlled as usual. The dimmer function works smoothly, allowing for precise control over lighting levels, which is particularly nice for creating a cozy atmosphere in living spaces or dining areas. Overall, it's offers a great value for upgrading your home lighting while providing the flexibility of smart features when you want them. It’s a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to enhance their smart home experience!",

The usuasable dimming range for me that doesn't produce a very obnoxious hum from the bulbs is like 5 to 15 %, and 90% to 100%. It makes them less than ideal. I thought it was the bulbs I was using in my home, but tonight I installed one at a friend's house and it did the same thing. She has Lutron dimmers on the same model of can fixtures that don't hum in her kitchen, but lights on this switch in the bathroom hum like crazy. I tried all three settings in the app, it didn't fix the humming. To be clear, all of the bulbs connected to the dimmers are dimmable. Bottom line. They are priced well, but for as often as you are going to need to purchase them, I'd recommend getting the better Lutron product.",

        "text": "I installed three of these and they work okay. The dimmer is controlled by a vertical touch sensor in the middle of the switch. I like the rocker arm controls that are on my Lutron dimmers better. The dimmer is not smooth. There are like 6 intensity graduations, but it suffices. I thought it would be better using the app, but it is the same. Thank god the Treatlife app automatically found the switches so installation was easy otherwise they have to be manually installed and it is pain because I tried and it wouldn’t connect to my wi-fi ….. something to do with 2.4 Ghertz. couldn’t get past it. However, as soon as I gave up and went back to the main screen, “Found New Device” would pop up and it connected to the wi-fi perfectly. I bought some Eaton smart dimmers that were not too expensive. I plan to try those. Eaton is a good brand. I wish I could afford Lutron, but $50+ per switch is too much for me.",

        "text": "So, I purchased a TreatLife Switch to replace a failing old Fan/Light Switch. I loved it. And, it looked so attractive, and was easy to use! Because it worked great, it convinced me to get TreatLife switches for all the other rooms in my home. And, ... this was where my nightmare began. Note: this switches will start to glitch early on is there are more than 1 treatlife switch on the same breaker. Is always dimming on it's own. (1) Their 3way switches are very poorly designed. And, I mean VERY poorly. They ONLY pair with \"dumb\" 3way switches. By \"dumb\" they mean toggle only non-powered switches. (2) They are not UL or ETL certified, so many electricians will not touch them. And, due to design flaws, these switches may be hazardous in your home. (3) They have a high amount of leakage on the common line. (as in can damage other items on the same breaker high.) Especially other TreatLife switches on the same circuit breaker. (up to 120V of High Current) (4) They do not work with all bulbs. In fact, they work with only a small number of bulbs. Don't count on those low wattage LED bulbs working. Now, they state lots of \"gotchas\" in their small print to get around the above. Like only 1 treatlife switch per breaker circuit (as if). And, will not work with Smart Bulbs (oh, and a whole long list of low wattage bulbs). That their 3ways are non-\"standard\" (as in they do not function to code). And so on. Sadly I spent 550$ in switches, and 1K plus trying to get electricians to help solve all the issues caused by these switches. In the end, I exceeded my return date while trying to get these switches to work. There customer service was \"responsive\", but not helpful. And, they strung me along until the return date was past, then they just disappeared. There are better alternatives out there (ie. like KASA switches both on Amazon and at Home Depot.)",

        "text": "There are only 3 cons for me with these dimmer switches, otherwise I love them and being able to dim the lights is a game changer, especially if you suffer from migraines or have an infant. Its compatible with Alexa and Google and works well. With adjustments the dimming can be low or high and there are 3 different moods, but there is only a slight difference. The cons: 1. Set up is a pain. It can sometimes be difficult to get them to pair with your smartphone. It's also not intuitive if you change wifi routers. You have to complete the process all over again with any changes. It would be better if the app connected to the wifi and then automatically connected the devices. 2. Your settings for the dimmers reset themselves and you will have to set it up again for each individual dimmer. It would be better if there was a way to set a preference for rooms and/or all dimmers. 3. There is no control for cybersecurity so someone could hack the lights and then potentially hack your system. They should have a feature allowing you to change the password for the devices.",

Had the switch replaced in no time, however the spiderweb of extra electrical wires made locating the proper white neutral in the switch box tough. Once I did the switch functioned wonderfully, only negative I had was the switch only communicates over a 2.4ghz network and had some difficulty getting that to work, tweaked some network/Bluetooth settings on my phone and then it worked. Once I did however it synced with Alexa well and light its functioning as described. Will buy more in the future.",

The dimming works well, I just have some cheap dimming bulbs from dollar general and plan to get better ones in the future when these burn out.

Under 2000 square foot homes usually only have all their lights on two circuits. Which means you might only be able to use two. This is because when they wire lights in series one dimmer switch will cause the lights on another dimmer switch to flicker, basically it back feeds power and flickers brighter than it should be. This product either should be removed or add an obvious disclaimer next to the \"neutral is required\". Cause chances are you will install one or two and then have issues with the rest and who is gonna uninstall them to get a refund.",
