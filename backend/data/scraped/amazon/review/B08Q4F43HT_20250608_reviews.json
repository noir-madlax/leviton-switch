They provide basic power monitoring (instantaneous and summation) and function as Zigbee routers which helps provide a stable network. So far their function and been flawless.",

        "text": "I bought a number of these for our old house, and they worked great. This year, I moved to a new house and bought 13 of them to replace the switches in the house. We were having some work done on the house, so I bought them and asked the electrical guy to install them. By the time he was able to install them, my 30 day return window had closed so I'm not able to return them. But if I could, I would! None of them work correctly. If you turn them on or off, it's anyone's guess if they will work the next time you need to change from on to off (or off to on). I spent 20 minutes last night poking the off button on the switch trying to turn off my bathroom lights so I could go do bed. I was almost in tears by the time they finally worked. The blue indicator light is supposed to turn on when the switch is off, but right now my kitchen light switch is showing as \"off\", but the kitchen light is on. They become \"unavailable\" in my home automation a number of times a day, which is not endearing home automation to anyone in my house. Everyone told me that when this company was purchased by GE the quality had fallen. I didn't believe them. Don't be me. Get a different smart switch for your house. Or at least install them before the 30 day period is up!",

        "text": "I have purchased two of these switches over the years, and neither of them functioned as intended. They failed to pair and were unable to perform basic tasks such as turning the lights on or off. The wiring was correctly installed and tested in multiple locations. These switches were intended to replace older GE/Jasco models, which had worked reliably for approximately 15 years. Despite using identical wiring configurations, these new switches would not respond at all. I confirmed that they were receiving power, as indicated by the illuminated LED light at the bottom. However, the switches themselves remained non-operational. When I installed an old GE switch, using the exact same wiring setup, it worked without any issues.",

        "text": "Searched far and wide for a 3-way switch solution that could meet my criteria. - Had to match the ivory color decor of all the other switches in our home. - I wanted to avoid wifi switches and stick to Zigbee. I've already got HomeKit, Home Assistant with Zigbee and Phillips Hue in the house so I wanted to avoid another hub. - Had to work with my wiring. More on that below. Note: this is referring to wiring in the USA. Now of course since I already have Hue I could have replaced all of the recessed ceiling lights in the room with Hue and gone with Hue switches but with 9 fixtures on just this one 3-way that would have cost a fortune! I just wanted to automate the switch and keep the existing lights. The included ivory switch paddle was super easy to swap out. I also purchased the matching add-on switch for the 3-way setup which also included an ivory paddle. The total cost def higher than Zigbee relays I've been using for single switch automation but there is no way I could get those to work with my 3-way wiring. Installation was pretty easy. The issue with my 3-way wiring is the supply is in first box and the load in the other \"end of run\" box. The end of run box had no supply in it. Luckily this smart switch only needs one of the two existing traveler wires to connect to the add-on switch so I was able to use the second traveler (I used the black) to transfer supply to the end of run box (where the load is) and put the smart switch there. The add-on switch went in the box with the supply and connected to the smart switch via the red traveler. The installation instructions include a number of wiring configurations and overall are pretty good. However if this configuration was shown in the directions I didn't see it. That said it wasn't hard to figure out. I looked at a lot of other options and none of them could handle this scenario. I also really like the fact this switch uses momentary contact on/off. I find that to be a tad more intuitive than \"dumb\" 3-way switches where one switch is always in the \"on\" position. The blue led on the smart switch is on by default when the light is off and it is pretty bright. This is ok for some rooms however I would not want this in a bedroom. It is easy to change the behavior so the led is on when the light is on and off when the light is off. Press 'on' 3 times quickly then 'off' on the smart switch. This toggles the led behavior. Hopefully it lasts. Time will tell. Just one minor con: The included ivory switch paddle is a tad lighter in shade than my other switches and switch plates. But it's a minor difference and no where near as ugly as a white switch would have looked. The wife says that is just my OCD showing and of course she's right. I will be purchasing more of these to automate additional 3 & 4 way switch setups in the house.",

Discovery with Alexa was a pain in the behind. Took 3 tries on first switch then 5 or more times for 2nd switch. After pairing they work just as good as GE and are compatible with the slave switches on the circuit. Same switch, different company.",

        "text": "I installed this switch at my back door to control external porch lights. I have a number of Zigbee devices in my home, namely Aqara door/window sensors that I use to control a variety of door related automations. While Aqara does offer an equivalent Zigbee wall switch to this Enbrighten model, the Aqara switch has a Decora sized on/off pushbutton switch that is not particularly attractive and has a mushy feel to it. I like that this Enbrighten switch has a more standard looking paddle appearance to it, making it \"blend in\" better with existing \"dumb\" paddle switches in my multi-gang box, and offering a more intuitive appearance and operation similar to a \"dumb\" paddle for those unfamiliar with smart switches. The switch installs easily, and I like that it has multiple wire entries at each screw terminal - the screw terminals are a clamp down style, meaning straight wires push in on either side of the screw terminal, and the screw tightens down on the wires, holding them firmly in place. I was able to unbundle my 2 wire-nutted \"hots\" and use one of the hot terminal screws to capture both of them, eliminating the need for a pigtail to be added to the \"hot\" bundle and run to the switch - the screw terminal captures \"pass through\" duties for the hot wires and also powers the switch - good stuff. ALL connections are done via screw terminals(hot, switched, neutral and ground), meaning no wire leads coming off the switch itself, which I find leads to better cable management within the box. I did add a white \"pigtail\" lead off the neutral bundle by twisting the pigtail on to that bundle and replacing the wire nut, as the white bundle contained more than two wires. I added the switch via a Zigbee dongle and ZHA to my Home Assistant box - pairing was easy, when I opened up the \"add device\" option in HA, the switch immediately advertised itself to the Zigbee dongle, without any need to put the switch in to any kind of pairing mode. I did not bother adding any kind of Enbrighten app to my phone - the switch paired locally and that's exactly what I am looking for as I pursue an entirely local smart home. Being a mains-wired Zigbee device, this switch acts as a Zigbee radio/repeater - I have an Aqara door/window sensor in my curbside mailbox, and it easily joined to the switch's radio/repeater to facilitate my \"You've got mail\" automation that announces the mail's arrival on my voice assistant. Previously, I had an Aqara smart plug providing this radio/repeater connectivity to the mailbox, but I wanted an in-wall switch as the smart plug was serving no other function other than to act as a radio/repeater to the mailbox. I exposed the switch to Alexa through my Nabu Kasa account in order to integrate it with a eufy doorbell cam so that the porch light controlled by this switch can be turned on overnight if the doorbell detects motion. The switch is also controlled by a HA automation, which turns the same porch light on at dusk and off at 10PM - everything is working fine. Please note that the switch has a blue LED - by default, it is on when the switch is off, and off when the switch is on - that can easily be overridden to on when on and off when off by 3 rapid \"on\" presses of the upper paddle followed by a single press of the off paddle. I prefer the blue LED to be off when the light is off, and this would be especially true in a bedroom, where I imagine it would be quite annoying to have the blue LED glowing when trying to sleep. Reviewers complaining about the blue LED should be aware of this. This switch is a bit pricy, but the Aqara version is similarly priced, and as I mentioned, I think the Enbrighten has a more intuitive and ergonomic feel to it versus Aqara's giant mushy pushbutton approach.",
