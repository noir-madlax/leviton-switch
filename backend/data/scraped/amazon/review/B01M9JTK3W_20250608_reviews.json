Dimmers bought at Lowe's or Home Depot made the lights flicker. I hope this one lasts a little longer than the first one, I only got 5 years use from the first dimmer. In my opinion dimers should last longer. Only issue I had was setting the lower and upper brightness. I had trouble understanding the instructions on how to set these levels and probably should have contacted tech support. I did get lucky with the setting got the upper level brightness right, but the lights don't fade when turning on or off. I ok with not having that feature.",

        "text": "I bought this dimmer due to the tankless water heater I installed. Because of the way the heater elements cycle on and off, the LEDs in the bathroom would flicker if the dimmer is below about 50% and the hot water is on. I bought a half dozen LED dimmers of different types and from different brands in my attempt to get rid of the flickering. Sadly, it doesn't seem like any dimmer can combat this phenomenon, though this dimmer cured another problem that I didn't expect. This house already had a generic 10-bulb hollywood globe fixture in that bathroom when we moved in. I replaced the bulbs with dimmable LEDs and a Lutron LED dimmer and discovered the bulbs would buzz as soon as the dimmer was moved from full brightness, then got louder the dimmer you went. I just figured these bulbs just happened to be noisy and dealt with it. In the course of testing all of the dimmers for this project, every one of them- including this one- was just as noisy as the original Lutron, until I switched this one to reverse-phase (also called ELV) dimming. As soon as I flipped that tiny little switch and pushed the cal button to save it... Silence. Not a sound. All of that buzzing I had dealt with for years (because I thought it was normal) was now totally gone, just because of this dimmer. Seven dimmers tested from Lutron, Leviton, Eaton, and GE, and this Legrand is the only one that silenced things. Completely worth the price to not have to deal with that noise every time I turn on the lights, and that wasn't even the original purpose of the testing. I have to admit it took me a few minutes to get the programming to work properly, and the mistake I was making there was not using the appropriate-sized tool to press the cal button- it requires a fairly firm press and your finger won't do it. In addition to switching from forward to reverse phase, I turned off the auto-cal feature and manually set my lowest dimming point to the lowest the switch allows. Also, I'd like it if the mounting flanges were metal instead of plastic, though this is more of a preference as the plastic didn't cause any problem. So a bit of a long review, but with the hours of testing I put in with so many different dimmers, this one deserves some recognition. Excellent product.",

        "text": "Short answer: Buy the next step down (half the cost). Long answer: We just upgraded all our lighting - new, top-of-the-line led lights throughout the house. These dimmers were recommended by the lighting expert at our local high end store, as being ones that would move forward and adapt as led technology changes (which it apparently is doing rapidly). We now have 45 of these installed throughout, and they are a huge hassle - if they even work. If programmed to actually dim (their default dim status is very bright - might as well not use a dimmer at all) then they may, or may not, turn on your lights. Seriously. Example, in our kitchen: two switches and their six lights all come on - the third which controls the three lights over our island? Either won't work at all, or just turns on one. The other two might kick in later. Several other won't work at all. It's kinda like having our own personal gremlins in the house. Answer: call Legrand, right? Wrong. One of the techs was nice to me, but not helpful - another was rude to my electrician, who is a master, and a friend, and a great guy. Basically saying to replace them, they would have to send out an engineer. Thankfully our local big-box hardware store, where the electrician bought most of the switches, is willing to take and trade them down, even w/out the original packaging. Final bit: they may be 'smart', but they sure act stupid. (For the record, yes our wiring is all to code and installed in the last decade - yes neutral grounds were used - yes all enclosed literature/instructions were read and followed).",
