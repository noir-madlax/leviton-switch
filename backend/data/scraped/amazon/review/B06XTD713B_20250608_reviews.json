Although they don’t dim them at all, they just turn them on…which is fine, that’s all i really cared about i guess but i would be more happy with it if it didn’t take rolling the switch all the way to the end to turn them on, which is not practical at night. Especially since i have to scroll it 3 times around. also doesn’t allow for the controller use and can only choose one color and one setting.",

I am glad I did though, as the connections were pretty bad. The PCB looks decent otherwise, but whoever soldered the USB leads on, did a bad job stripping the wire. It probably would never have a problem as the insides are not likely to shift, but you never know and even a short in 5v is enough for a bad time. I still kept it, but probably would not recommend due to the safety concern. They could easily fix this issue with a little quality control.",

The other is white and VERY bright. I wasn’t expecting this from cheap SHEIN lights that are literally each a mere 12” wide, max. I thought, if anything, they’d hardly light up. And then when finding these dimmers I thought for sure they wouldn’t work, even though it’s just a simple USB connection. But nope, they work perfectly! Which is great because I wasn’t sure the white light in the nursery would get used with how bright it turned out to be. Now I can use it for a super cute nightlight or crank it up if we are in there and want some cool white light.",

Another reviewer said it didn't work for his neon sign but it's not the product it's the type of sign you have. Some need full power or they shut off. But the well built neon signs will allow power fluctuation which mine apparently does. Thank you for a great product. Would definitely buy again.",

Also, the taper for the brightness potentiometer is terribe, it feels linear when it should probably be logarithmic.

Sort of gets the job done...though not that well, wouldn't buy again until they redesign it.",

However -- I got it for an LED lamp that continuously cycles through a range of colors, and it turns out that in order to do that, the power has to be on max. I can have a red glow as dim as I want it, but the color change cycle won't start unless I turn up the power all the way. If I unplug it while on a different color, it comes on red again when I reconnect it, and stays that way unless I turn the power up. I realize this is my lamp's problem, not the dimmer, but since this is probably not an uncommon type of device to want to use this with, you should be warned it may not work for that.",
