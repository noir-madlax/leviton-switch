It is easy to install and functions great. Just be sure to use dimmable bulbs (we’ve had good luck with Philips) otherwise the dimmer and this switch can act wonky.

        "text": "Over the past few months, I’ve gradually replaced over 30 switches in my home with Lutron Caséta Claro, Diva & Aurora models. Initially, I was hesitant to spend extra on the accessory switches, especially since the Caséta and Diva work fine with traditional dumb switches in a 3-way setup. However, after comparing the quality of Lutron’s switches to standard ones, I realized the difference was undeniable.I had two 3-way switches in my living room and kitchen, both paired with traditional switches. The disparity in quality became too noticeable, so I decided to complete the transformation and replace the remaining 2 dumb switches with Lutron accessory switches, for a seamless, uniform look. The installation process was straightforward, thanks to Lutron’s detailed instructions that cover various wiring options. However, I did encounter a situation where my wiring didn’t match the diagram. Rather than guessing, I reached out to Lutron’s tech support on a Sunday evening, fully expecting to leave a message. To my surprise, I was connected to live, US-based tech support person, who spoke clear English. They quickly walked me through the correct wiring process and even followed up with an email outlining the connections we discussed. They encouraged me to reach out if I had any further questions—a level of service that’s rare these days! Now that every switch in my home is Lutron, I couldn’t be happier. They not only look and feel premium, but they also come with the peace of mind that Lutron’s exceptional customer service is just a call away. Pictured alongside the new accessory switch in the 3-gang box, are the Lutron Aurora dimmer and the standard Lutron dimmer switches, which blend perfectly into the overall aesthetic. If you’re looking for superior quality, ease of installation, and excellent service, I can’t recommend Lutron and their switches highly enough. They’re absolutely worth the investment!",

        "text": "So I thought my wishes were answered when Lutron finally added paddle switches instead of the original pico switch. I installed this in a 3-way with a Caseta Diva Dimmer. I'm disappointed that you cannot change the dimmer brightness with the accessory switch , only the main Diva Dimmer Switch (and the Lutron hub). The alternative would be to install a Pico remote switch, but they are so ugly. I cannot explain why they didn't make this accessory switch smart itself, with its own radio.",

So the Diva/Claro accessory combo worked well in my application of a location with no neutrals. I prefer this to the Pico remotes because these will never need batteries since they are hardwired. The Pico remotes battery life is about 10 years, so not a big concern, just one less battery to think about. Lutron ecosystem is the best.",

I was hoping these would work similar to a Pico but they really do nothing. First off, they're hardwired which I knew. But, I was under the impression you could program the one tap function to go on at the level you set, similar to the Pico middle button. Not the case, they will go on to the level that the main Diva dimmer is set. Which of course gets moved constantly whether on or off. So don't expect to ever know what brightness you're going to get with a single tap. Yes, the double tap will take it to full level and bypass the main dimmer. These are not recognized in the app and can not be programed like the Pico either. Pretty much just an expensive 3 pole switch you must use with the Diva dimmer. Three stars for lutron build and quality, nothing for innovation.",

Generally works nicely, although missing the dimmer functionality of the remote. Does require some patient determination of what wires are available: where is the line voltage, where is the load, which red wires go to which box, etc. and getting everything correctly connected. As for the headline, one of my accessory switches was intermittent in a circuit with a dimmer and another accessory switch. Sometimes it would toggle the light, sometimes not. Replaced it with a new one and so far it’s working as expected.",

        "text": "If you're using the new Caséta Claro Switch or Diva Dimmer in a 3-way or higher situation, then these will give you nice control at the remote switches. For dimmers, press once and it turns the lights on to the level set by the slider at the main dimmer; press again and they go full bright. It would just be nice if you could manually brighten or dim by holding the switch down, but you can't. If you want dimming control at the remore locations, you should use a Pico. If you have any questions about what wires to attach where, call Lutron's 24-hour tech support and they'll walk you through it. They are great.",
