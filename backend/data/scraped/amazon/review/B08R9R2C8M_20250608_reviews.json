        "text": "Okay after carefully considering everyone's review, and I always take them with a grain of salt, I purchased these and installed the box in the light switch across the hall and the receivers are in the garage. One is 3 ft away the other is about 20 feet away through a wall. At first they only worked 10% of the time. I would push the button and nothing would happen. All 4 buttons (up and down on either remote) have a very tactile feedback and an audible click. Turns out you really kind of have to hold the button for a second in order for it to work at all. Almost never will it work if you tap it quickly. Occasionally I'll still get one not wanting to activate the lights if I hold it. in the grand scheme of things it's not that bad, but that is the absolutely most annoying feeling in the world, hitting a button, hearing it click, seeing the button light up, and nothing happens. It seems like when they are throwing a fit, time or hitting the other remote has been the only thing that works for me. My issue was no light switches in the garage, this gave me light switches that work, somewhat. Am I ecstatic? No. Is it a cheaper alternative to having an electrician come wun new wire and install a switch? Definitely. Just wish they worked every time. Biggest downfall is doing the work to install a solution that only works 80-90% of the time.",

        "text": "Previously I had recommended to remove your old wall switch, throw it away, hide the new controller in the wall box where the old switch was, put one of the new switches over the box, and put the second new switch wherever you want it. BUT, THE WALL BOX MUST NOT BE METAL. A metal wall box will interfere with the controller's wireless signals to the switches. You can test this by operating the wall switches with the controller in the box and out of the box. In case your wall box is metal and interferes with the wireless signals, simply cut a small rectangular hole in the Sheetrock below, put the controller inside, cover the hole with thin cardboard, disguise with a small amount of drywall compound, and paint same as the wall.",

        "text": "I installed this wireless switch on August 28 to replace three way wall wiring that had become problematic. The installation went as directed in the instructions and the wall switches looked nice. The light comes on nicely from each of the two switches. The problem is getting the light turned off. On occasion it will turn off on the first try and occasionally it will turn off after many tries. The only sure way to turn it off is to take the switch off the wall, hold it about 18” from the light then click off. I love the idea of the wireless switch but this model has not worked well for us",

The OFF channel deffinently has a shorter range than the ON channel. At the same distance the switch would turn on but not off. Sometime I have to hold down the switch until it turns on/off.

A couple times it turned off immediately, but then I realized those were the times that I was holding the remote closer to the receiver. The only thing I've found that consistently works is to take the remote off the wall and point it at the receiver (like a TV remote) to turn off the lights. Holding it vertically in the *exact* same place doesn't work! Both switches have issues, but sometimes just one or the other, depending on how I orient the receiver (the walls they're on are at right angles to each other). Initially I had it hanging out of a j-box above the garage door motor (receiver flat/horizontal), then got different behavior with the receiver vertical (like it is when packed into the box). The relative orientations of transmitters (switches) and receiver seems to matter, but I wasn't able to find one that worked consistently for both switches. Both switches have line-of-sight from two corner doorways to the center (ceiling) of a two-car garage (15 feet?).",

        "text": "My minor complaints are: 1-the mounting/housing needs to be a bit wider to fully cover an existing box. 2-Once in a while, the first tap doesn't work. Bought to solve the builder's bad idea of switch placement. This allowed me to place one switch by the door into the room, and to still have a switch in the original location. It would have been nice if they made the switch unit be able to mount in a standard switch plate(I wasn't bold enough to tear it apart to see if I could modify it).",

        "text": "This was the perfect solution to our entry way hall that only had a switch on one end. Installation took only a few minutes and it works like a charm! The only negatives are that the switches aren’t very aesthetically pleasing and one of them is a little finicky about where you have to press the button to get it to activate. Those things aside, it was an easy and effective solution for a minor inconvenience that I was obsessed with fixing…. (I used Command strips to mount on the wall instead of screwing the plates in and it has worked great.)",

You have to hit 7 or 8 times to turn it off. Since it is wireless, I swap the two switches. And still the closer switch has no problem and the 7.5 feet switch is not turning off. That swap indicates it is a product design issue, not an individual defect issue.",
