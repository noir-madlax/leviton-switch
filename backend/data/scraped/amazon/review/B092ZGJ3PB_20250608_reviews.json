        "text": "Why is my photo of a light instead of the wall switch? Well because this is the type of light that this dimmer works with. The dimmer is a 0-10v dimmer. Most dimmer switches reduce the overall 120 voltage down to zero. They lower the voltage on the HOT wire. But this dimmer switch always sends the full voltage on Hot and two other wires send a low voltage of 0-10v. 0 is dimmed all the way (not off) and 10 is full brightness. The light I got was this one: https://amzn.to/4atB7UZ And it works great. I ran power from an outlet up to the switch using Romex and then from the switch you run Romex to the light but also 2 low voltage wires. I made a mess in the wall and ceiling there but that's pretty much how you do it. Easy to patch. 5 stars. This was the least expensive 0-10V dimmer I could find on amazon or anywhere else. All the ones at Home Depot were also more expensive.",

        "text": "First the good, It was relatively easy to install. the markings on the back of the unit are nonsensical, but its not hard to figure out, they have the 3 way leg marked off on one of the 2 red wires, the other red wire is your switch leg, your black is your hot input, and the white and blue are youre gray and purple LV wires for the dimmer function. and if your light supports it it does dim exactly like its supposed to. The bad, This is a UNIT. i had to tuck the WAGO connectors behind the other switch because this thing uses up the entire depth of a junction box for itself. additionally its clearly a much lower grade of plastic than the Leviton switch in the box next to it, that crisp tactile click when switching the light on or off just doesn't exist and the plastics feel flimsy, also the dimmer at the bottom sort of just lets go, theres no tension for the bottom 2 or 3 mm so the lights go completely off instead of down to their lowest setting, i have to keep it about 20% up from the bottom to get the lowest dimmer position without them going completely off. not really sure though if thats intentional or a symptom of the dimmer curve on my lights. but the dimmer itself moves fine but is also made from flimsy plastic. it just doesn't feel as robust as a name brand unit, but for the price point thats to be expected. All in all this switch gets the job done very well and i plan to keep it for the foreseeable future. if i have any issues with it ill edit this review but value for the money is there and while I wouldn't recommend it for a heavy duty applications, for most projects this would be a very good solution.",

        "text": "The switch showed up on time and had all the parts it said it would have. Installation was pretty straightforward and mostly works with the Metalux 2x2' troffer lights I recently installed. The lights are pretty bright, so I wanted a dimmer (they use the 0-10V dimming scheme, which this product has). It looks nice and includes a faceplate. It is only in white, but I decided for the location, it would work. I have 2 issues: 1. The size of the switch/dimmer just barely fits in the box along with the wire nuts. Smaller would be nice. 2. The biggest issue is that the dimmer is not great. I have a different, major name brand I used in a different area on some of the same lights that has smooth action and cleanly goes from about 10%-100%. The KEYGMA dimmer doesn't have a very smooth feel; it has a loose at the bottom to tight at the top feel as you work the slide up and down. Worse, at the lowest setting the lights flicker then go out. Only after you get the slider up to where it feels like it \"catches\" will the light come on consistently at a dim level then go to full brightness as you push it up. I read the tips and suggestions that talk about a recessed potentiometer on the bottom that was supposed to do something, but it did nothing on my unit. The feel and action of the slider makes the switch feel cheap. Also, there is a small hole on the lower left front that I had assumed was an LED so you could find the switch in the dark. There is no light in that hole, so I guess it is just a hole. A little guide light would be nice. In all, I will continue to use this dimmer because it mostly works and I don't have it in a high use area. However, I will not buy another one and I do not recommend it. In my opinion, if you need a 0-10V dimmer/switch, I would spend the extra $10 and get a better one from a major named brand.",

        "text": "We ordered this single or 3 way dimmer switch for our dining room light, which is wired with a 3 way switch (meaning two separate light switches at either side of the room can turn it on or off). I am not yet able to install it for this purpose, because we don't have dimmable LED's yet, but I tried to test it on a single pole switch with an incandescent bulb. I admit, like others, that I found the wiring diagram confusing. There are six wires coming from this Keygma switch--two red, one black, blue, white, and green. The second red wire is identified by label as for 3 way applications, and does not need to be wired for single pole applications. I was unable to correctly configure the remaining wires according to my best understanding of the diagram, to get it to work. I think clearer instructions would help. The switch is ETL (Electrical Testing Laboratories) tested, which is an alternative to the UL (Underwriter's Laboratories) that you also find on many electrical products.",
