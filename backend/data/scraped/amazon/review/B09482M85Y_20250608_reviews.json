Although you can connect the wire the old-fashioned way by connecting it to the screw, in this case that could not be done because it was the grounding connection, which sits at the very top and would get in the way of the gang box screw. So, I had to toss that one - ARGH!",

I was looking for a way to control the blinds via a wall switch to add a professional touch to my room. I learned that you can directly associate Z-Wave devices to each other, and I purchased this switch, hoping I could pair them together. It works perfectly! I directly associating the switch to the blinds in Home Assistant using the \"On/Off Control\" and \"Remote Dimming\" groups. Now the blinds will open when I press the up bottom and close when I press the down button. Furthermore, if I hold the up or down button, the blinds will go up/down until I release. This is exactly what I was looking for! The best part is if I ever move from my house, the direct association will continue working without my Home Assistant hub set up. For some reason, I couldn't find anyone else who had this set up when I searched Google, but it worked perfectly.",

Using Home Assistant software, they even support direct association which allows for true 3 way functions without the need for rewiring. Great for remodeling. So far I have replaced 49 insteon devices with Zooz units, and I couldn't be happier. Not a single dud, easy setup, and after 2 years not a single failure. I have 28 more devices to do and I am confident they will be Zooz devices. As always, if you need it, get it. You won't be disappointed.",

I have several Zooz 800 series switches and really like them, so I thought I might as well replace one of my Leviton zwave dimmers with a newer one that supports S2. Unfortunately, it's been a bit of a let down for 2 reasons. While dimming (any level but full brightness), it emits an audible buzzing noise that I can hear several feet away. But what's worse is when dimming to a lower level it feels very choppy. Dimming up works much better, but down is almost like a flicker. On the other hand, the Leviton dimmer it replaced dimmed these very same LED can lights smooth like butter, with zero flicker or choppiness. Indistinguishable from incandescent. It almost feels like the microcontroller is underpowered and can't process the brightness steps fast enough. Really weird. Sadly I will put the old dimmer back and use this in a less used place.",

The only issue I came across, which I do not believe is the fault of this switch, is I get flickering at 100% with my bulbs (they are dimmable). In searching reviews for \"flicker\" the only results are from people specifically mentioning no flicker. So I'm assuming it's the bulbs. In any case, I set the maximum brightness to 85% (I picked that number arbitrarily as it's still plenty bright, higher is probably fine), and the double-tap upper paddle behavior to \"Configured maximum brightness\" and that works fine.",

        "text": "It's not amazing. I bought this one and another slightly more expensive Leviton one a few days ago to compare. These Zooz ones do work but two major issues with my set up. I'm using it for overhead recessed lighting retrofit LED replacement. The brand is one I got at Lowe's called Utilitech. Firstly the Zooz one is noticeably slower, with delayed responsiveness compared to the Leviton switch. I am using Smartthings and Googe Home. Second issue is the dimming precentages. The lights can be dimmed lower, all the way down to 5% with the Leviton. With the Zooz switch, the brightness being dimmed to 40% is almost imperceptible. 50% eith Zooz is comparable to Levitons 5%. This might not be a big issue as you just have to adjust what your scale is for what you tell Google assistant to dim the lights to or through your phone's app, however I still have GE Zwave Dimmers too and they operate at similar dimming settings as the Levitons. So it's hard remembering to set the kitchen to one dimmed level and the living room to a completely different one. Also since the GE and Leviton match, kinda makes me think it'd a Zooz issue. Could just be with my specific lights, but just putting it out there. As a bonus negative, the QR code that said SmartThings didn't work to set it up. I was able to get an unsecured setup. And that could also be why it has those issues as it states if you don't complete a secure set up, you may have issues. But the set up of the leviton was also easier and worked immediately.",

Now Homeseer will flash devices with \".gbl\" files. Updated firmware on device. Deleted node, factory reset on Zooz, rebooted Homeseer, re-paired Zooz. And after about five minutes it had built up all the sub-devices and it worked. Took over two hours to install a light switch. If this sounds like fun, then go for it. What Zooz needs to do is: Not ship defective devices that require a firmware update just to function. Not to mention updating my smart home hub to accommodate a single devices fancy new firmware format. Furthermore, Zooz wants you to submit to \"registering\" your product before you can get their firmware. That's insane. They shipped a defective non-working light switch and I have to go through some data-harvesting process and hopefully get vetted so they will send me the firmware that they should have installed before selling the thing. Then I get the pleasure of doing the job that I paid them to do in the first place when I purchased it (install functioning firmware). Sorry if that sound privileged or something, but I did pay $45 for a light switch.",

I also have several devices that may require warranty replacement. Back in 2021 the support was great. Now I send emails and do not get a response. I am completely ignored. Phone calls immediately go to voicemail and I never get a call back. I used a different email account and got the answer along the line of \"well, if you have problems with our devices, you should change the brand\", not even working on diagnosing the root cause. I opened tickets and they are automatically closed within minutes or just being deleted. There is no way to find out, if the devices are registered, since there is no response. I wanted to get some troubleshooting going and never get any response. There is also no ability to find their physical address and a different way of contacting beyond their info account. I am really disappointed with the deterioration of their service and them ignoring me. Update 3/24/23: The company is not only ignoring me... they blocked me from their Facebook page after a negative but constructive review. I do not believe I did something wrong, except for buying their products",

I configured it with my Smart Things hub using the Zooz edge driver, and then exposed to Homekit via Homebridge+ST plug-in. The edge driver has an astounding number of parameters that you can play with, if so inclined, and a fair number of Controls exposed in the ST app. Since the Zooz and Jasco are close in price, I might use this again in the future.",

I want to like these. They are easy to program with our Smart Things hub. I've got two that are installed outdoors in protected housings which have held up fine in cold weather. There is an \"air gap\" plug under the paddle. I've had multiple switches spontaneously fail when this air gap popped out. It can't be reinserted. Zooz (The Smartest House) couldn't explain to me why this happened. Initially this occurred under warranty. They sent replacements. I reinstalled. Had my electrician check that these circuits were wired and acting appropriately (wiring in the house in only 4 years old and I haven't had any other issues). Now I've had several more fail. Out of warranty. Out of luck. Zooz won't back up their products or offer any explanation as to why this happened. The circuits they control are not overloaded. I've wired well over 200 switches and receptacles over the years in homes that we've owned and have never had a switch fail. So buyer beware. Lots of great reviews that I imagine are written after initial install. I typically don't write negative reviews but this product certainly earned it.",

Only complaint... as I was installing it, turning breaker back on, pots were live but in the lowest dim level... to me they looked off.

This switch *requires 4 wires at the box*, which was not my case. So I had to return it (thanks for easy returns!) and order an other product that should support 3 wires switch boxes. My appreciation is that the description is not clear enough (hence 4 stars), and unless you open your boxes and compare with the well redacted documentation before ordering, you might end up with a non compatible product.
