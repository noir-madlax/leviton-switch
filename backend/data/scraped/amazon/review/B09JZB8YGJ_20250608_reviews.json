        "text": "Excellent product! I have several Gosund smart devices and find them to be the most reliable when compared to other brands. I moved into a new home and wanted a dimmer on some recessed lights but also wanted to use it with my Alexa system. The design of the switch with the screw terminals is a space-saving design but having to install the tiny screws that are included is a little inconvenient. I am an electrician by trade so this isnâ€™t a big deal. Setup to Alexa and Gosund app is a simple and fast. Dimming control using Alexa is so convenient, too. I had purchased a Leviton model from HD but took it back because it required another accessory device to work as a 3-way. That is not the case with this model and it works perfectly when installed as the switch with the power feeding the circuit as shown in the device instructions.",

Bought 6 more so I would not have to go through the installing the multiple apps as I have been doing before hooking up to Alexa or Google. In this case the dimming was more important, needed to be turned very low. That is how I discovered these are TERRIBLE for this. They will dim the lights but not enough, you might as well leave these on or turn them off completely. Look at the other low star reviews. If your just trying to adjust the light during daylight in a room they will work, but forget about a soft glow at night.",

I was hesitant to purchase again because the previous iteration had some quality issues, but we didn't want to replace all of our switches just because one went out, so I purchased again. However, I was very pleasantly surprised upon receiving the item that the packaging was new, the product looked similar but the quality was much better, the screw holes were standard size (a big problem with a previous version), and all in all I was very happy with the updates. It seemed to be primarily a quality improvement, rather than a complete redesign which meant it fits perfectly with our previously purchased switches (gosund) and it isn't immediately obvious aesthetically that one switch is a different version. Very happy to see a company actually listen to consumer complaints and make quality adjustments.",

I ordered 6 of these switches with high hopes I had finally found the perfect touch dimmer switch with wifi capability. Unfortunately I've got to keep searching. I tried everything through the app to see if there were options for setting the low light trim and there is nothing to lower the lowest setting. Usually on a dimmer switch there is a setting or a toggle switch to lower the lowest setting to where the lights can actually be off at the lowest dimmer setting if you want it that way. This switch at the lowest possible setting was about at about 50% power. The product images show that it can be set from 1%-100% which is completely false. There is no trim setting. With all that being said I unwired and boxed everything up and didn't even begin to try to pair with Alexa. No need because my main concern was with being able to dim the lights to a low setting for evenings and events and it was as bright as daylight still. Returning all of them.",

I'm extremely disappointed and after having 2 of the 4 installed by a contractor (and paying for it), I'm now having to also pay to have them swapped out as well. What a waste of money!

        "text": "I ordered the GHome Smart Dimmer Switch to replace existing dimmer switches we had in our home to be able to control them with our voice using the Alexa app. The switches were easy to install, came with helpful labels for the wires, and were simple to connect to Alexa. Note: You'll have to install yet another smart home app to use these switches. (I really wish the smart things community would get together and combine into a standard app.) Of the four switches included in my order, only three worked. One was dead on arrival. I wish I would've installed them all right away, so I could return the defective one. Other than the one DOA switch, the only negative comment I have is that they don't dim low enough. Our previous switches would dim significantly more. We would leave them on their lowest setting for watching movies, but the GHome switches are still so bright on the lowest setting, that we have to just turn them off and do without the low light now. If you are looking for dim lighting, you might want to try a different brand. The lowest setting seems to be about 50-60% of the full level.",

        "text": "Switch and everything works well. But the design is practically pointless. See why below: - The on/off toggle is within the press of the switch as well as dim control. So, whenever you try to on/off the switch you will either set the brightness to too low or too bright 99% of the time. You have to be very careful in not touching the touch control for brightness when turning the switch on/off, which is highly impossible as you would need to spend more than 2 seconds to operate it. I had 4 of these for bathrooms and they are useless as they can be too bright or too dim when operating at dark hours :(. My purpose of buying is too make them automatically off after sometime/schedule using Alexa the control of brightness is the annoying byproduct! Quality wise they are okish..",

        "text": "First, I posed my questions here and got no response from the manufacturer - that is minus 2 stars. I have a pile of Smart Life smart switches in my home. They work great, work properly with the Alexa toggle function (instead of 2 separate routines for on and off, the toggle feature allows you to put one routine so whenever you call that device, it will turn either to off or on depending on current state). This only became clear AFTER I had installed these switches and was programming them. The other thing, and yes it is being picky, but the picture in the ad shows the bottom power light in green. When all of my other switches are off, the green LED power button comes on so you can find the switch in the dark. When these switches are off, all you see is a tiny white LED at the brightness setting when it was turned off. The app is rudimentary but functional, more for showing ads than versatility. It is clunky with limited functionality. I found that the switches were just as easy to set up in SmartLife so all my switches, even these Gosund switches, are in one place for Alexa. So they work but not as well as they should. No response from manufacturer.",
