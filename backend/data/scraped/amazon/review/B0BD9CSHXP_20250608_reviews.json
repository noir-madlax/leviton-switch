But, after 6 months (bought in July), it wasn't turning the fan on any more after a shower. I initially thought it was just not as humid since we were in the middle of winter and I wasn't seeing any humidity on our mirror. But after it started warming up, the moisture was back on the mirror (which extended down past the level of the switch) and it still wasn't turning the fan on. I even changed the sensitivity to the highest setting. The fan works fine when pressing the fan button so there isn't anything wrong with the fan or wiring. Ended up having to pull it out and replace it with another brand.",

I guess prior to that, it worked just fine; kicking on about 3 minutes into a steamy shower when I'd forget to turn it on ahead of time... but that doesn't really matter now that it doesn't kick on at all.",

Lots of other humidity fan/light switches are also occupancy sensing for the light. This one was easy to install, and the default settings on the humidity control and time settings are perfect. (Rapid increase over 50% humidity triggers fan, will run for 20 mins). It will also re-sense after 20 mins and run the fan an additional 10 mins if needed. Pushing the fan button will run the fan for 20 mins, which is needed for households with people who would turn it on and let run for hours and hours without a clue and also don't pay the heat bill.",

Amazon exchanged it. Since then, I've had 2 more failures. Leviton has a 5 year warranty on this, so I submitted it for replacement. They've sent me replacements, so that's good, but I'm getting tired of rewiring an old switch back in every time I need it replaced. Replacement is not sent until they receive their old one back, so it takes over a week for each one. If it didn't cost so much, I'd probably go another route, but I'm determined to get my 5 years out of it.",

I like this company and I've used a number of their automatic light switches before. The description doesn't say the light is manual, only that the fan is automatic. Furthermore, it says: \"Advanced Sensing Detection Modern look with advanced technology that minimizes false triggers when room is occupied\" Why would a humidity only sensor care if the room is occupied or not? Anyway, the company is fine, the switch is fine (it's chunky but not as chunky as a wifi smart switch, so you need a big, but not huge box) - I'm just super annoyed that I installed this thing and couldn't figure out how the auto light worked only to find out it doesn't have one. Plus pushing the button is way more annoying than flipping a traditional switch. Bleh.",

The switch functions great, turning on automatically about a minute into a shower, and turning off automatically after the programmed duration. Its a little pricey, but I'm confident this switch will effectively reduce the humidity in this mold-prone bathroom.",

        "text": "My son kept forgetting to run the fan when he showered so I ordered this switch. It comes on by itself and doesn't take that long to kick on once I have the shower going. Maybe a minute or so. If you turn the fan on manually, the fan will shut off by itself after 20 minute which is nice. A lot of times I'll run the fan then leave for work and don't have to worry about it being on all day. You can change the setting on it to be less sensitive and the amount of time the fan runs but I was fine with the way it came programmed. I was worried it wouldn't be that great especially for how much it cost but it works a lot better than expected Update 4/2025 My first switch stopped working for the fan part of it so I called the customer service and they sent me another one right away. Their custoer service is domestic which is nice. The second switch has been running flawlessly since I've installed it. Glad they stand behind their product. They even had me mail the old switch in so they could see why it failed. They paid the postage and I got the new switch before I got the return postange e mail so getting the new one was not contingent on sending the old one in.",
