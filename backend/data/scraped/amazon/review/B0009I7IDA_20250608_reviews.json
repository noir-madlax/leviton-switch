Wired 14/2 Cu with stabs and then tried screws. * Note - Leviton Did respond quickly with replacements both times and their QC Dept is following up. Tried to tell me there were bugs in the switch from my house ( with pics ). I have no bugs in my walls and my J boxes are all foam sealed. The bugs ( Mayflies in the pics) are not from around here. Maybe from the Country of manufacture? Ive heard and seen the 3rd switch arc 3 times now in the first few months since install. I'm done with these. 40 yrs in the industry and have never had to change a light switch for failure in my life.",

One of the four was shorting out and might have been a fire hazard. I bought four of these and replaced them and they work great with nice solid switching. The light in the surround cannot be seen during the day and at night it is not real bright. You have to install with ground wire on left and the two hot wires on right otherwise you will install them upside down. Worth the time and effort as DIY project for little money. Turn the power off at the breaker box before messing around with wires.",

        "text": "As some other reviewers pointed out, the switch has no \"on\" or \"off\" labeling like a traditional switch. This is because to save money, the single pole version was engineered to be identical to the three way version, just with a paper-like plug in place of the third screw. It even retains the \"common\" terminal label on the case. Because of this issue, you have a 50/50 chance of getting the orientation right on installation. And wouldn't you know, I got it wrong. I am here to tell you that you need to install the switch with the lettering UPSIDE DOWN if you expect up to be \"on\" and down to be \"off\". That is to say, it is BACKWARDS from how it is shown in the manual. The terminals should be on the RIGHT with the switch in the vertical orientation.",

        "text": "Overall - very good. Toggle action is good. Not too much or too little resistance, IMO. I prefer this version with a solid white toggle and perimeter light, as opposed to clear toggle. I installed in a bedroom & may have to tape over the lighted portion or replace with a non-illuminated switch since I've been told it's too bright at night. So, it may be great in a Hall or other room, but perhaps not a bed room if very sensitive to light and where it is relative to the bed. The toggle does not have \"On\" or \"Off\" printed on the toggle, which I found odd for a single-pole switch. So I checked continuity before installing so that up was on & down was off, the first time. Perhaps one can tell by which side the wire screws are located, but I wasn't sure. No big deal, just odd. I'd rate it a 4.5 if I could, since I think a product has to be really outstanding to get a 5 (if equating same to a 10). Would buy again.",

We have 2 switches controlling the same lights. Anyway...the one I did hook up gave us a nice 'white' but dim light that won't disturb your sleep if you have to walk down a hallway in the night to use the restroom. That said, you will be able to find the light switch location easily in total darkness. Many of these types of lights have an 'orange-ish' glow. These were more modern LED white - which I would prefer. Side screws AND quick hook up options here. Good switch - GREAT PRICE!",

        "text": "I would NOT buy these again. First, the light itself is green. Did I miss that somewhere in the description ? Second, when the toggle is off, the green light is very dim. And, of the clear ring around the outside of the white toggle, only the upper left corner is lit up green. I tried three (3) of the 5 switches I purchased and they were all exactly the same. I also did two things. Thing 1: I used regualr incandecent bulbs and that made no differene at all. 2: I set up a test circut in my work shop with a single 60 watt incandecent bulb and on its own circuit. It also didn't make a difference. I would certinly NOT recommend this particular item. The purchasing and shipping process went okay. It's just that thr product is not worth the money. I'm over to Lowe's latter today to purchase a Cooper lighted toggle switch (all white no clear ring) that is made for LED bulbs. Well, you will some you lose some.",
