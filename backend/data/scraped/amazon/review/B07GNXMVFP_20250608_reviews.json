I did notice I had to swap out some bulbs if you have multiple bulb fixtures. I'll keep an eye on them over time and report back any issues. The bottom line is they work great for the price. Like others said they are a bit big to jam into the gang box, but I let the electrician do that. They only charged me $150 for all 13 switches. Not wasting my time for the install price. I also have 3 spares, so if one dies over time I can replace with same dimmer.",

        "text": "Bought a pack of six and a pack of two to replace old dimmers in the house and add a few new one. Noticed that the rocker in one of the switches is unstable and doesn’t turn the light on half of the time. Returned the pack of two which contained the faulty switch and installed the rest. Now after about 2 months of use, other switches are starting to show same symptoms one by one. It is too late to return them. Stay away from this brand and save money and time.",

However, the problem rise if you're going to install two units together next to each other as the metal frame is too wide for the units be next to each other. Because the electric box frame is certain size, the wide metal frame that surrounds the switch will make it virtually impossible to be placed next to each other and fit under two units wall plate. Most of times, you would want the two units together in one place, but without removing the metal plate, this would be impossible.",

The reasons I bought Bestten switch :1) looked like it would be an exact replacement for current switch. Looks ok and works. 2) at about $10 they are half the cost of a Levittown dimmer rocker. The bad news is the current rocker switches made in China are poorly made ( the plastic rocker breaks and the switch has a ball bearing that falls out when the plastic cracks…. The Bestten switch is also made in China, looks like it is built the same; and is similarly cheap. I expect some will fail in 2 years The durability ? Too early to tell…. Relatively easy to replace. Maybe Bestten made the plastic stronger?",
