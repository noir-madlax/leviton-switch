So much so that it takes so little effort to mistakenly switched if off when you are trying to switch it on. Plus the product is so light that it gives you the impression of a cheap material. I wanted to return it but it was past the date of return. The only advantag eof this switch is that it handles a 3 way switch with no issue but i wish it could have been built more solidly.",
