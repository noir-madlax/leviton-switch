        "text": "Ordered the six-pack late in the day and got them in on Prime the following morning. I installed the first two switches that following morning. The first one went into our den, where I had an ancient slider switch that had a broken slide handle. The other one went into our kitchen dining area, next to the den. So glad I opted for the six-pack as the unit cost per switch was closer to $9 each. At my big box stores all the sliders were in the $20+ range, which I felt was just too much. As for the promises of 'reduced flickering', that was one of the problems with our den ceiling lights. I'm running six of them. And with the old dimmer I had problems setting the lowest light level. The dimmer would either shut off or flicker. With the new dimmer, I can slide the switch to the lowest level, get a very low level light from the ceiling, and it holds steady. It's like a 'night light' level. So yes, this switch operates as I've wanted, but didn't have with the old switch. Overall, what with unit cost so low, and performance so high, I can only say that I'm hoping these dimmers last for at least three years. I'm guessing they'll go further, as our old dimmers did have long-life as one feature.",

But they do buzz on the highest setting on 1. Buyer beware. I know have to consider replacement for fear of fire hazard. Edit: the company offered me a refund or replacement. Iâ€™ll give them 3 stars for good customer service.",

I have to regularly remove the face plate and mess around with the switch on a few of these to get them to start dimming again. I have one that has completely stopped working. When I adjust the dimmer switch, it doesn't dim at all. If I remove the plate to test and physically push inward, it works. So there's some sort of defect and it's only been about a year. So I'll be swapping them out with the Home Depot ones from here on out.",
