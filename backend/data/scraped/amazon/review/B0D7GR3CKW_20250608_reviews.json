It works flawlessly in both 3-way and single pole setups, offering a lot of flexibility for different room layouts. The dimming slider is smooth and responsive, allowing for precise control over brightness levels. It supports a range of bulb types—LEDs, CFLs, incandescent, and halogen—which is a huge plus. I especially appreciate that it doesn't require a neutral wire, which made installation in my older home super straightforward. The overall build feels sturdy and the design is clean and modern. For the price, this is a great value and a simple way to enhance lighting ambiance throughout the house.",
