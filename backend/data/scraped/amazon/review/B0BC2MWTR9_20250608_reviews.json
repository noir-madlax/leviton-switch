The product itself tells you if you did the wiring correctly and the switch light confirmed I had it wired it correctly. Then, in order for the switch to work, you have to pair it on your phone using their app. I downloaded the app, followed all instructions, and it wouldn't pair. I tried several times with my Android phone, no luck, then I downloaded the app on my wife's iphone. Still the app would not pair with either phone. Then, as advised I went to the website to troubleshoot, but there is no troubleshooting on the website. Only descriptions of why the product is so wonderful. The problem is there is no option to skip smart installation which I didn't need. So if it doesn't pair with their OWN APPLICATION, the product doesn't work at all. After wasting more than an hour, I had to undo all of the wiring and I repackaged and returned the product. As it says in the title, it doesn't work with either Android or iphone.",

It's not a user issue, I have these throughout my house and set them up originally with issue. But changing the network breaks them. Either will never connect or connect for a short period only. And now I have 2, that I never tried to switch the network on suddenly lose the WiFi connection and won't reconnect. I've tried resetting and every work around, but they never get connected to my home network. I've installed dozens of these and ultimately they're a poorly designed product if you can't change network settings or if they can't stay connected. Don't recommend KASA at all now.",

        "text": "We've used a variety of 'smart devices' throughout our house including smart bulbs. By far, the most reliable method of controlling lights are with these Kasa switches. They're easy to set up, easy to manage, work with Google or Alexa voice commands, operate nicely when using them manually, and are easy to install as long as you have a neutral wire which they require. Our house is older and needed to have neutral wires run to the switches which required we have an electrician assist. Despite the additional cost, it was well worth it. We will have more of these installed shortly so that we can set schedules for when lights should come on when we're out of the house or on vacation, easily dim lights to any desired brightness, and control everything from our phone or tablet from thousands of miles away.",

I hired an electrician to install everything and the first 2 sets of the 3 way switches I had him install didn’t work. I had purchased them more than 30 days beforehand so they were unable to to returned. So I bought two more and hired the electricians for a return visit, and those two kits didn’t work. My home is a new build no there were no wiring issues causing any of these problems and to verify, I had the electrician uninstall one of the Kasa Smart 3 way sets that worked and had them install it on the switches where the repurchased sets were not working. The set worked so we knew the wiring wasn’t at fault. So now I’m needing to try a 3rd time as I don’t want to need multiple apps to control my home’s smart switches! So frustrating and expensive to have to keep hiring electricians because a products is faulty!",

Ordered this Kasa and it came first thing the next morning. Installed both switches in 10 minutes, it automatically connected to Alexa because I already have a Kasa camera connected to Alexa. Renamed it in Alexa and bingo, perfect functionality! Connected switch 1 (main) to the switch that had the line in direct to breaker box.

Instread, I was required to wait on hold on a customer support line for a very long time and then respond to a series of confusing and poorly worded emails. I was not seeking a replacement although I do need one. Since this is the second Kasa device that has failed for these lights, I wanted some technical advice about why this might be happening. I have spent some considerable time on the phone and responding to emails but I have been unable to obtain any technical advice about what might be going on here. Very frustrating and time-wasting. I realize that I am just one customer out of millions and so have no significance to Kasa, But it is not nice to be treated in this way.",

Most require the primary to be on the light side. With the KS230 kit, the opposite is true. The satellite needs to have the load going to the light, and the main has the load going to the main power. Once this is done, installation is simple, and the switches are easy to setup on the KASA app as a single unit. In a bedroom, it is nice having the ring LED's programmable as on or off when the lights are off. When first installed the lights would go off at 40%, but you simply go to Settings and Dimming Calibration, and the entire range is made available for smooth dimming and Alexa can control the entire range. Fade on and fade speed off can be set differently.",

The instructions are very clear and the kit includes labels for the wires as you uninstall the old switches. Really like the slow off of the switch. Also you can control the dimming from either switch. Finally like being able to use the app to control the switches too.",

We have a 4 year old home that we built so all the wiring is updated if how these hook up. Super easy to do. Just follow instructions. And I'm not an electrician. Don't need one.

        "text": "I'm pretty good with electrical stuff and this took a lot of thought. My line and load were in same box but these switches call for them in separate boxes. They don't have a common like traditional 3-ways. My house had a 14-3 running between boxes. I connected black wire between boxes to load on satellite switch and to the black wire from light(load) in main switch box and tucked it to the back of the box. I used white and red wires between boxes as travelers between switches. (Simple to install once I figured out the workaround.)",

        "text": "Installing the Kasa Smart 3-Way Dimmer Switch has been a total game-changer—especially as a parent. If you have kids who constantly leave the lights on, this is a must-have. ✔ Ultimate Convenience – I installed these in the basement, and now I don’t have to trek downstairs every night just to turn off the lights the kids left on. I just tap my phone, and done. ✔ Dimming & Remote Control – Whether I want to set the mood for movie night or just turn the lights off from bed, the app makes it effortless. ✔ Reliable Wi-Fi Connection – No hub required, and they’ve stayed connected without issue. ✔ E-Z setup – It takes just a few minutes per switch and then is typically coupled with an update (switches need firmware updates? What a brave new world..). Then you're good to go. Honestly, once you have one, you’ll want more. These are the kind of smart home upgrades that feel like a superpower. Highly recommend!",
