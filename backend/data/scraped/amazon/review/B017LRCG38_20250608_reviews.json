        "text": "I have many of these throughout my house and I give them all a 5 star. However, in the instance of my last install I had problems controlling a rope light. I replaced a basic on/off switch that controls the alcove rope light in my bedroom. Once installed, it turned the alcove rope light on but when the switch was turned off, it turned the light down to about 50% (not totally off). At first I thought it could have been a faulty manufacture, but when I replaced it with an identical Lutron switch, the same half-off phenomenon occurred. Very peculiar. Replacement of a basic on/off wall switch resulted in a totally off light.",

        "text": "The Lutron Caseta Smart Switch delivers on its promise of seamless smart home integration, and as Apple HomeKit users, we‚Äôre thrilled with its compatibility and rock-solid performance. Setup was straightforward, and it‚Äôs been flawlessly controlling our lights for months without a single hiccup. The app is intuitive, and voice commands via Siri work like a charm. üì±‚ú® That said, the switch‚Äôs design feels a bit dated compared to sleeker, modern Caseta models. The tactile buttons and glossy finish don‚Äôt quite match the minimalist vibe of newer smart switches. However, since it‚Äôs tucked behind furniture or in less visible spots, the aesthetic isn‚Äôt a major issue‚Äîjust a small nitpick for design-conscious users. Build quality is excellent, and we appreciate how it plays nicely with other smart systems. If you prioritize reliability and smart-home synergy over cutting-edge looks, this switch is a winner. Lutron‚Äôs reputation for durability shines here, even if the style isn‚Äôt the latest. **4 stars**‚Äîit‚Äôs a workhorse, not a showpiece! üîåüëç",

XXXXX turn on the kitchen light.... nothing... Oh wait, someone turned the switch off. It seemed like half the time, that was the case. I really didn't want a solution that worked 50%. Then I did some research and found other solutions that people had problems and frequently had to re-boot stuff to get it working again. I'm almost at 3 years and it just works! I use these switches for simple on/off lights, I use the fan switches to control all my ceiling fans and I use the dimmer switches on most of my lights so I can control lighting levels, most using scenes and automation including turning my entrance light on when I get home and a light inside. Then 5 minutes later, turn the entrance light off. If someone physically turns the light off manually, no problem, the assistant can still follow the command and turn it on. These are especially good as an investment since they work with most personal assistants.",

        "text": "WARNING: Bought a 3 USED Lutron CASETA Smart switches for the remodel of our lower level in 2021. Thought I could save a few bucks. I had no idea what a crapshoot it would turn into. Finally got the electrical wrapped up this December 2022. Turns out that 1 switch was the Maestro version (non-smart model), another was dead and the last one worked. My Electrican told me before installing them that dead ones are common with USED switches and Outlets. We found that out the hard way how true that is. Unfortunately, we are well beyond the return date. This part is my fault. The person or company who returned these products should have \"the day they deserve\" and Amazon, at the very least, should have made sure the right product was shipped. I'm positive that Amazon doesn't check returns for functionality, but that might be a good idea for some products. DO NOT BUY USED ELECTRICAL SWITCHES UNLESS THEY HAVE BEEN VERIFIED/TESTED!",

        "text": "I power washed the house several weeks ago and forgot to pull the little mini slider turn off on my switch, anyways the yellow Feit Florescent bulb blew, I tried to replace it with an LED bulb however, it would not work. I knew why, there was no common (white) wire on my existing switch. I bought mine many years ago when they came out. As everyone knows the light bulb industry switched from florescent energy saving in favor of LED bulbs. The old tech without the common (white) wire on the switch will not work with the new LED bulbs, so keep that in mind if your in a similar situation like me. The good news was all three Pico remotes I had programmed to this outdoor switch I was able to re-program and they worked beautifully, thank God. Being able to turn on your outdoor lighting when you drive up to a dark driveway at night is a major safety convenience as well as turning on your lighting from your easy chair without getting up is another nice feature.",

        "text": "I own a 1985 home that I've recently been trying to add some smart functions. I got hooked into smart home tech after solving a few basic quality of life issues through automation. My next project was lighting. I debated between adding smart bulbs or smart switches and after trialing these Lutron's - the smart switches clearly won. These basic on/off switches are great for locations where you don't want dimming functions. Locations such as fans, fluorescent ballasts, outdoor security lights and the like. They provide simple push on-off capabilities, \"smart\" on/off through the Lutron app and in my case, advanced control using an integration with Home Assistant. It's really cool to see and control the status of my lighting/fans, regardless of where I'm at. Pairing the switches with your Lutron hub was quite intuitive and easy to do. Just press a button while you add the switch in the app. Integration into Home Assistant was equally easy, the native Lutron integration is quite slick. For examples of how I use these switches for advanced automation? If I take a shower, I use humidity values to turn on or off my exhaust fans. I also have motion detection triggering the lighting in my bathrooms, entry way and closets. (No more \"turn the lights off\" from me anymore!) For outdoor lighting, I can now control it based on AI-analyzed security cameras. No more security lights turning on because of snowfall, heavy rain or animals - it's for people only! Install of these is generally fairly easy in most cases. If you understand electrical basics, such as the load wire, the neutral wire and the hot wire(s), they are pretty straight forward to install. 3-way applications get a bit more tricky where you have to use a Pico remote, which seems to make sense so you don't have smart things fighting with each other. Installation requires a few very basic hand tools. For the most part, these are fairly slim and fit into their boxes quite well. I did have some challenges in a couple boxes that had a lot going on, but made it work. I definitely recommend using Wago connectors for your retrofit, they make connections a breeze compared to wire nuts. If you're concerned about electricity or think it's beyond your ability, an electrician should be able to install these without any troubles. I think with smart technology, it's very important to define \"rules\" by which the stuff will operate. These are mine. First, everything has to operate intuitively, like a light switch would. Second, it has to operate without any \"fancy\" server side smarts or network capabilities. Three, it has to integrate with my home automation system of choice as I don't want to be beholden to any particular vendor or app. Generally speaking, these Lutron's satisfy my requirements. If you're in the market for smart switches, these are about as good as they get. I've been really happy with the advanced capabilities it offers the home owner. While they are expensive, a full \"smart\" retrofit with a single platform is going to add value to your home, should you go to sell it. I'm glad to be partnered up with Lutron in my home, they are definitely on the \"recommend\" list.",

        "text": "This review is more about the Lutron Caseta system. The switch is OK. It works fine. But the Caseta system includes dimmers that cannot remember the last brightness setting!!!! Even the $120 dimmers can only remember a \"favorite\" default setting, as opposed to the last setting. This renders the complete system useless. The previous Lutron Maestro generation could do more; $20 dimmers from other manufacturers can do much better.",
