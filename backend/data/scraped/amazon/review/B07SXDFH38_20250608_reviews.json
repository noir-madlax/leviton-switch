The automation provided within Google and Feit app is pretty good and not too difficult to set up ie come on at sunset (rather than a fixed time) and off at a fixed time, or X hours after event. I keep the outside lights on at 40% power for looks and power savings, and when motion is detected on one of the three cameras outside the house, the lights come up to 100% for a period of time, then reset to 40%.

When you set a light level, the switch comes back to the same level after you turn it off and back on, unlike some other dimmers.

        "text": "This more about the non-existence of what I want than the functionality of this product. I have a couple dozen Feit smart products throughout my home, mostly color changing lightbulbs. We love them and couldn't be happier with most of them. The problem is with the bathroom lights. I have them set to be a normal white throughout the day and a dim blue at night, but when it comes to turning them on and off we don't want to have to use the app or call out to a voice assistant every time we go in or out of the bathroom, so we just use the switch on the wall. This means that if the bathroom lights aren't on when our day-to-night or vice versa routines are triggered those lights don't get the memo and we're likely to get blinded by bright white light if we have to use the toilet at 2AM unless we remember to turn the lights on, wait for up to a minute for them to get reconnected to Wi-Fi, run the light changing command, and then turn them off again two times everyday. I saw the Lutron Aurora Smart Dimmer and thought my prayers were answered because it just fits over top of the regular switch, keeping it in the on position, and sends its on/off commands to the smart bulbs via Wi-Fi, but, alas, it only works with Philips light bulbs. I thought for sure that Feit would have a similar product because it seems like such an obvious thing but, unfortunately, no such product exists. I figured the next best solution would be to install this switch and set up my routines so that this switch turns on a minute before any change to the bulbs is performed and then turns off again another minute after that. It works fine but having to resort to this inelegant solution is very annoying",

I have always gotten other devices to work but it always seems like they take multiple tries or I have to go through a special step (like browsing to the IP of my smart garage door opener to set it up via my phone). In this case it was super easy. After turning the breaker back on and testing the switches to make sure they work. I just needed to hold the switch for 10s until the indicator flashed quickly. From there the switch popped up in the add device workflow in the app and I was able to push the WiFi settings to the switch and manage it. Super easy!",

Very easy to install ourselves and were a perfect match to the others previously installed in home. One great feature is the small light in the switch that allows you to find the switch in the dark. It has multiple levels of dimmer and can be controlled from the app and set up on a timer for ease of use with outdoor porch lights. Makes for easy dusk to dawn timer. We have several Feit products in our home and they do not disappoint.",

        "text": "First off, I like these switches because they actually have a metal plate instead of a thick plastic plate for mounting in your switch box. This makes it much easier to mount in a two or three Gang Box because the plate is the same thickness as other switches. Secondly, it uses screw terminals instead of wire leads which saves you a lot of space in the switch box. You don't have a bunch of wire nuts in the switch box. If you are wanting to use this in a three-way circuit, you need to read the instructions very carefully. It's not straightforward as you would install a regular three-way. But it works fine. You can use the Feit app, or SmartLife. I had no problem adding them to SmartLife (with my EvaLogik switches) If you have problems setting it up, make sure you do a full reset. I have found that solves most problems.",

However, when I changed my wifi password, there was nothing I could do to update the switches and get them working again. I have about 60 smart home devices and about 12 of them are wifi based. It was the Fiet and Kasa devices that just would not allow me to update. I tried everything, including removing the devices and attempting to add them. I went through all the established procedures of removing and adding, connecting to their device wifi , making sure devices were close to phone and router, making sure devices were set in the correct pairing mode at least 10 time each. It just doesn't work. If you ever plan on changing your wifi password to ensure to maintain some level of security or if you think that you will need to change your router at some point, avoid these wifi devices and stick with zigbee or z-wave.",

        "text": "This would have been great if it continued to function. However, turning off the switch no longer cuts power to the light fixture. It's just permanently on no matter what position the switch is in. I have had to unscrew all the lightbulbs until I replace the switch with something else. I contacted the seller and they have made no response -- apparently unwilling to honor any kind of warranty. Amazon's \"chat with seller\" interface features a button labeled \"Report Seller\", which I would very much like to do, in light of their negligence and failure to stand behind their product, but *that button* doesn't work either. (So now I'm pissed at Amazon in addition to the seller.)",

        "text": "We intended to install this on most of the ceiling lights in our house. We had no problem with our previous house due to the simpler setups. One useful feature is to have it on a three or four way circuit in our hallway. We tend to forget to turn off some hallway lights and don’t realize it until we get upstairs. It would be great to use Alexa to turn all the downstairs lights off. Unfortunately, these switches requires common and for 3 or 4 way switch setup power and common at the end of the chain for this smart dimmer switch to work. Unfortunately, on our 3 and 4 way setup, there is not enough wires to the end to feed the power and common with the control and ground all the way to the end. Oh well, I don’t think there is any smart switch that does. This can as Feit says work but they didn’t state the requirements. The other thing inconsistent is the dimming. For some reason, the lights does not dim much with some Feit LED dimmable lights made by them. It may work sometimes with more or less bulbs is that circuit. It is very strange. I have not tried enough other brands to see if it is isolated to Feit bulbs. We have a number of Feit bulbs from Costco at a good deal with electric company’s rebates. We like the feature of this smart dimmer otherwise. It is also made by a large company sold at a decent price.",

        "text": "I specifically identified this switch as a great-value candidate for my 3-way installation, with one dimmer and one regular toggle switch. That was accurate - for $20, this switch does a great job! BUT I ended up tearing my hair out for half a day trying to get my wiring right after no matter what I did, the other switch WOULD NOT toggle the light! Luckily I read through the reviews, and one or two alluded to faulty units which worked perfectly except for the remote switch. I requested a replacement, and wouldn't you know, the second switch wired in exactly the same worked perfectly the first time! A couple of tips after this experience: The directions are EXTREMELY adamant that in a 3-way installation, the power MUST come from the OTHER junction box and the load MUST be in THIS junction box. That's not really true. Long story short, the switch requires an always-on (not-switched) line and neutral. The load output obviously has to go to the high side of the light you're controlling. The 'other' side, if a dumb switch, simply needs to toggle line voltage to the \"RED/YLW\" traveler terminal of this switch. Any time the traveler input changes between 0 and 120V, the light will toggle state. In my case, the \"remote\" side just had a 14/3 romex running to it, red-white-black+ground. I wired black to hot and red to the switch terminal on the remote side, then red to traveler on the Feit side. That worked perfectly (after getting rid of the faulty unit!). Had the load been on the remote side, I could have just wired that via the unused white wire. Long story short, as long as you have enough wires in your box to correctly wire LOAD to the output, and toggle 0/120V on the traveler terminal with the \"other\" switch, you're good to go.",
