        "text": "My house has paddle switches throughout. I have used the original Caseta dimmers for many locations around the house and never liked the look-and-feel. The new paddle dimmers look just like my existing dimmers and have added features within the Lutron app that allows for setting maximum and minimum light intensity (doesn’t seem like a big deal but it is - who doesn’t have a chandelier that blinds you if the full power is turned on? Or the lights don’t come on when minimum power is set?). Worked well with HomeKit. Downside is the cost and doesn’t support Matter network (have to Lutron bridge).",
