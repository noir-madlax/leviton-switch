        "text": "I wanted to replace my old bedroom hot water circulator timer, which began giving me problems, with a switch to save on electricity. The timer was set to run two hours in the morning and two hours at night to cover the times we got up and went to bed. With the switch we run the circulator only when we need it, which is about 10 minutes a day. Instead of a basic single pole switch I opted for this Leviton PLR 20amp switch with a lighted toggle. It's larger than a normal on/off switch so it takes more room in electrical box and it requires a neutral wire for the light to work. I bought a deep double old construction outlet box because I wanted to keep the existing outlet and install the switch in the same box. It required a little work getting the original outlet box out without much damage to the sheet rock. The deep box provided plenty of room for the outlet, the new switch, and the wires. I love the lighted switch. it's built to last and the bright red light is a great reminder to turn the circulator off. The only con are the directions...the five installation options are printed on a small piece of paper and require a magnifying glass to read. Not a problem if you have basic electrical skills and know how you want to wire it. I used a jumper from the outlet in the same box to provide a neutral for the switch.",

        "text": "The original \"service switch\" on my gas furnace was wearing out, so I'd figured that I'd replace it, with added flare. This Leviton switch has a smooth but affirmative action and glows a lovely share of orangey-red (like smoldering coals). It requires a neutral (white) wire connection to provide a steady glow, but all switches should have them nearby (look deep into the back of the switch box). In my case, I needed to add a little jumper wire (had a spare white wire from a recent Romex job) between the existing neutral bundle in the box and this new pilot light switch. Also pictured here is a 'Morris 83496 Emergency Metal Switch Plate, Gas, 1 Gang, Red' and a 'Clear Light Switch Guards, 3 - Pack | Toggle Style | Child Safety Cover | Light Switch Protection | Two Levels of Security | Home and Office' to help indicate what the purpose of this switch is and to discourage accidental flipping.",

There must be a tiny air leak because it frequently starts somewhat unexpectedly any time of day or night, and it's LOUD ... like meteorite has hit the house. Decided recently to add a pilot light switch so that I can turn it on/off somewhat more conveniently. The handle is bright enough to be noticable when I'm turning all the lights in for the evening. Thought about other options (e.g. motion sensor) but this seems to be the best option for now. I stared at the wiring instructions for a while before I decided to just read the other reviews. The instructions that come with the switch are a bit unclear and the font size is so small anyway it's difficult (for me) to read anyway. A similar Hubble pilot light switch costs a bit less but it was out-of-stock at my local big box so I bought this on Amazon. It's rated 20 amps so definitely adequate for most household applications, including a shop air compressor.",

This switch has made it perfectly simple to look and know immediately, without turning on the lights or even making it all the way down the basement stairs. Much simpler to keep from forgetting to turn it off, too - the light makes a perfectly visible reminder. Can't comment on installation, as I had our electrician do that, though it seemed to go quickly and simply enough. She mentioned that it was nice to have a solid 20-amp switch for just this kind of application, and she plans on keeping it in mind to recommend to others. :)",

        "text": "Installed this to replace my current garage light switch. I wanted a way to know if my garage light was on, without having to open the door. Well made, commercial quality. My only ding for this is... if you want it to light up, you need to connect the neutral/white wire to the upper left of the switch, else it will work but not glow red when on. Also, I was under the impression there was a pilot light in the off position. No matter how I wired it, that never came on. *Leviton - include instructions for the neutral wire/white wire to be installed as well for the switch to glow red when ON.",

Essentially the power feeding the fixture (load), is then connected back the switch at screw 2 to power the lighted switch.",

        "text": "Our RV came with an electric/gas combo water heater. The gas turn on switch is with the control panel for most other things like the water pump, lights, check the fluid levels, slide out, etc. However, the electric switch for it is in side the cabinet under the sink. The water heater would often get left on when we returned home and be wasting energy heating up water when we're not in there using it. So, we purchased this switch, cut a hole in the cabinet to the outside and now we can clearly see when the water heater is on!!! Much easier access, too, rather than bending over to get under the small sink cabinets. I suppose the priciness of this item is more supply and demand...how many people ever need one of these? The opposite switch (lighted when the power to it is off like for a switch in a bathroom for you to see at night is only illuminated when the lights are out so you can find it) is much more popular and all that we were able to find at a local hardware store.",
