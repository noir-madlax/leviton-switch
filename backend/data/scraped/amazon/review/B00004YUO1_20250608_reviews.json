Not completely quiet but doesn’t have that loud pop/click that competitor switches have. I ran out of my first 10-pack box and when I got another one the word “Leviton” was written in raised letters at the bottom of the switch. Searched high and low for switches without the name and thought these were “nameless” but I was wrong. These have the brand name written on the face as well, so I returned them. Don’t give up, there are “clean” face Leviton switches out there on Amazon.",

        "text": "I tested out several switches in stores, because the clicking sound when turning most switches on and off was much too loud for my liking. This 5601, in particular was disappointing, since it is promoted as a quiet switch. It's not, at least to my ear! The video posted in the review here by Stuart Schwartz on 6/30/20 really shows this. What if you are like me and know that every time you flip this switch you will regret buying it due to the loud clicking noise? There is a solution, the Leviton 5621. This switch is as close to quiet as you can imagine! It is more expensive since it is made to handle up to 20 amps of power, vs 15 amps with this model. A 20 amp switch will work fine in a 15 amp circuit. You are just paying for a more beefy switch than you need. Not a problem. In addition, the 5621 does NOT have the company name \"Leviton\" in raised letters on the switch. Many recent 5061 reviews mention this undesirable feature. So, while the 5621 is significantly more expensive, at least you have the option if you desire a near quiet switch without the company name in raised letters on the switch.",
