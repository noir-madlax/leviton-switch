        "text": "I am going to keep this short and simple this 3 way switch is garbage just like their other fan and light dimmer switches. I had 0 problems when first installed. Like it said it can be used with a dumb on off switch. Needing to install just one dimmer. Was working fine for several months and working on app and all. Then all of a sudden it is disconnect from wifi and is red. Tried wifi repair process and it was detected a couple times out of 10x. But app never was able to update the final step of wifi saving. Then the larger issues began. The device would no longer go into wifi paring mode so app cannot find it. No matter removing it from wall, hard reset, nothing worked. I think ok forget it I'll use it as only a dimmer. Works fine for several days. Then the lights started dimming to minimum randomly and maybe shut off. After that, the switch to turn on or off the light had no response, only the dumb switch worked. Following this, the lights started going completely haywire, non stop flickering when it is on for several mins. I was able to turn it off again with dumb switch only. Later that day I was no longer able to turn on or off the light with either switch on the 3 way. This thing is going in the trash! Worked barely for a couple months or so. Only thing from Treatlife are the single pole dimmers worked decently without issues for more than 3 yrs, EVERYTHING ELSE IS GARBAGE!",

Troubleshooting revealed burned-out ESP8266 boards that became very hot when powered. The unit with the failed relay became hot to the touch, which raised safety concerns for me. Unfortunately, these issues occurred outside of the support period. Based on my experience, the durability could be improved, so I recommend considering this when making your purchase.",

        "text": "Ok. I purchased multiple DS02 and DS01C3 switches. And, here are the issues: (1) (Which they now mention) The second switch cannot be a powered switch. (ie no light, smarts, nada). When they say it must be a dumb switch, they are saying it must be a \"poled\" up down switch. If you want a night light switch on both ends ... tough. (2) In the ON state both travelers are powered, in the OFF state both travelers are off. This is actually not code for 3 ways, and is the main cause for the issue in (1). But, it also leads to other issues. Basically, if your homes 3way in not a vanilla wiring, you will have issues. There are so many reasons why this is just a bad design. (3) When the DS02 powers on, it dumps up to 120V with mass current briefly on the neutral line. Depending on the line capacitance of your neutral line, and the proximity to other switches, this will cause voltage to leak into the neutral of other smart switches, causing them to briefly power on. If this switch is a treatlife switch, it may continue to pull current of the neutral, wich I suspect is not good for the DS02's life. (ie. they have started to post you can only have 1 treat life switch per breaker because of this issue.) All 3 of these issues are strong reasons to avoid treatlifes 3way switches. And, depending on your home, each of these reasons could pose hazards for your home. Note: None of their switches are UL or ETL certified. Many electricians won't touch these switches (as I found out). Sadly I spend 550$ in switches, and 1K plus trying to get electricians to help solve the issues. I exceeded my return date while trying to get these switches to work. There customer service was \"responsive\", but not helpful. And, they strung me along until the return date was past, then they just disappeared. There are better alternatives out there (ie. like KASA switches both on Amazon and at Home Depot.)",

        "text": "This smart switch will remain powered on the lowest setting on one of the travelers when the switch restarts either you push the restart button or when there is a power outage and it restarts when the power comes back. I discovered this when without a reason the light was on in the morning. I check my surveillance camera and after a power outage it happens. I am an Electronics Engineer and a certified electrician. I installed this smart switch with a 3 way non smart switch and before installing this switch, both were non smart switches and worked as should. The condition happens when the non smart 3 way switch is on one of the two positions depending on which terminal the faulty traveler is hook to. In the other position it works as intended but this makes this smart switch work as a single pole switch. I then took this smart switch to do a bench test with the same results. I contacted treatlife support and described the issue but got no solution. I was hoping there was a firmware update that could correct this issue. They offered a full refund for my order. Excellent customer service.",

I thought it may have just been a bad unit, so I bought another to replace it, but now just a couple months later the replacement switch has now lost all wireless functionality. I've tried resetting the switch, but this only re-enables the wireless functionality for a few moments. I have dozens of other smart switches from another brand that use the same Tuya backend, and continue to work fine 3+ years after original install - it appears Treatlife switches are of inferior quality since only this switch is troublesome. For those wondering, the switch is not overloaded as it is controlling only 66W of LED lights (6x 11W bulbs). I don't not recommend Treatlife switches.",

        "text": "I spent $850 over the course of a year changing all my switches to Treatlife products to manager dozens of recessed can lights, bathroom fans, ceiling fans, etc. With so many switches and kids, I thought it would be great to be able to dim the massive amount of can lights and also control them to keep lights all over the house from being left on. The theory is great but the switches are not. I have fought several to keep them on the network constantly resetting them. Several have been replaced. Several are not working now and I had to put the old toggle switches back into one fixture. I have a mesh network so signal is never a problem. Every time we have a power outage of any sort, many get messed up and have to be reconnected to the network / app. The newest versions I bought as replacements are even harder to get online since they “automated” the process. I have 2 that cannot be synced and are brand new. 3 out of the 4 fan light combination switches have failed. Naturally some that I have the most trouble with are in the basement and I have to go down to turn off one switch out of 3 that my kids left on even after using the app to turn off ALL basement lights. I contacted Treatlife about some of these issues and they wanted me to go thru all the programming steps and tell them what happens at each step. I explained it is not even turning on so I cannot make it do anything. Then they said I must have made a mistake wiring them. I am an engineer and have wired several houses and barns including fixing others mistakes. This is all run around to avoid warranty claims. They won’t stand behind the high failure rate products. My advice is to limit your installations to only devices that benefit from connectivity and avoid the headache and expense of such a buggy system. Definitely not worth the hype for a whole home install. And definitely not worth a wife being upset the lights or ceiling fan is not working.",

        "text": "We remodeled last year, and I made the mistake of purchasing a bunch of these for our kitchen, dining room and entryway. They look nice, but unfortunately they NEVER stay connected. You can get them to connect to the wifi but within 24 hours or so they disconnect and are no longer 'smart'. Alexa can't find them, and you have to use them like a standard 'dumb' switch. I have reconnected them hundreds of times, and they just disconnect again- to the point where after 18 months I have given up. It's not like I have 1 bad one. They all do it. And before you suggest that it might be the wifi or the wiring or something, I don't believe it is. I have several other brands of smart switches around the house that stay connected without any issue. It's a pain to go around replacing these, but we have slowly. And guess what, the replacement (from another brand) is staying connected without any issues- and Alexa is controlling it fine. Overall, these were a waste of money and time. I feel irritated when I think about how I've lived with them for the last 18 months and how I have to nag my husband every so often to get him to change one out at a time. He doesn't want to do it, so I just bide my time and ask occasionally and sometimes I get lucky and get once changed out. Anyway, my advice is try something else.",

Only need one Smart 3-way switch for one night, the other switch can be a dumb switch. Sometimes, the dimmer may cause the light to flicker. I have these installed for over 1 year, but lately a few switches started to \"disconnect\". Alexa would say the switch is not responding. Checking the app, said device disconnected and had to re-connect. While the re-connect is successful, it requires the device to be added to Alexa and Google Home again.

Three of them have significant problems with operation. They flicker and come on unexpectedly if any other switch on the circuit is used (see video). In this video you can see that this one just won’t come on at all. Customer support blames the installation but I’ve had it checked by two electricians and verified the connections myself. In all of the circuits it works fine with a mechanical switch and even occasionally works with this TreatLife switch. There seems to be a problem with their relay design. I wouldn’t recommend this brand, unless you like flickering and darkness. It’s not worth your time to troubleshoot.",
