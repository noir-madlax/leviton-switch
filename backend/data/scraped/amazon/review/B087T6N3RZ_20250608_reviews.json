The light does NOT illuminate the space above in a wide angle; at best it is simply a switch locator light. I'm replacing it with the original Leviton paddle switch that has a built in LED as the switch locator (when the switch was off, the fuller upper portion of the switch was lit with the soft glow from LEDs). The switch is also cheaply made, your only choice is to screw in the electrical wires, instead of just pushing them in, and I don't want to take a chance with such a cheaply made product.",

        "text": "The vendor we bought this same product from is no longer available. However, this is the same product, just a different quantity. This is a very dangerous product—somebody better listen! I installed these switches, and it never even occurred to me to look for the European approval mark or the Underwriters Listed or Unlisted label. There are no approvals for this device of any kind, which means it has never been tested, or if it was tested, it did not receive any approvals for installation or use in the USA, Canada, or the EU. All four of the switches we received are leaking voltage. This means that even when the switch is off, there will be power at the light or fan. If the switch is used to turn a fan on or off, the fan is always powered on. However, it cannot pull enough current to rotate. Throughout the night, the motor will continuously increase in temperature and may burst into flames in the middle of the night while you're asleep! Ours did not burst into flames, but we could definitely feel the heat radiating from a still fan. I'm not just a home DIY guy; I did my 10,080 hours to become a journeyman electrician, so please keep this message in the context it’s meant to be delivered. The attached picture is of another bedroom with a different fan and light using the same switches. The fan motor has a different switch leg than the light circuit. The picture shows the light are on. Please note that the lights switch is off.",

        "text": "These are overall really nice switches because of the unique LED’s up top. These actually provide subtle lighting for a small room which looks nice without being distracting if you want total darkness and also provides some visibility in complete darkness. The cons are- the switch itself sounds a little cheap when flipping. Best described it sounds empty inside as compared to a regular home depot rocker switch which feels more “full”. Not a huge deal but something to note. Second one of the two I got the LED’s have a very subtle flicker to them. Not enough for me to have to return it or for it to be noticeable unless you stare at it up close. Fit is perfect for switch panels I bought from different brands, and they are very inexpensive. Would buy again but would also be happy to pay a little more for a “fuller” more robust sounding and feeling switch actuation. Overall would still buy again. It’s great in my bathroom as it provides enough light to see what you’re doing during a mid night bathroom visit without having to turn on the light and blind yourself/wake yourself more with bright lights",

        "text": "Review for: SOZULAMP 2 Pack Illuminated Light Switch, Decora Paddle Rocker Light Switch with LED Night Light, Automatic On/Off Sensor, Single Pole, 15Amp 120/277Volt, White - $17.88 One of the switches failed soon after installation. Had it professionally installed in the day, flipped it on and off several times to test, went to bed overnight, got up 8 hours later, happened to notice that the light this switch was installed on seemed to be, on! It had broken sometime during the night in the on (closed) position - Huh? The switch was in the 'off' position (open) but somehow closed on its own which let the current through & turned the light on. The switch wouldn't shut off the current no matter which position the paddle was in - the power to the light could not be shut off via the switch had to unscrew the bulb which was burning hot so the light had been on for some time. How it all went: First off I got two of these switches had only wanted one but they're sold in pairs. Installed one of them in a dark hallway to add a bit of light and to locate the switch, worked great. Been flipping it off/on in normal operation. Had no planned use for the second switch so figured an extra for a rainy day. The one switch worked well and looked quite modern. A few days later figured that hallway could use a bit more light and decided to have the second of the pair installed. Both worked just fine then & was really impressed with the look and the amount of light in the once dark hallway. Then - the above occurred. Failed overnight in the permanently 'on' position. One is still working and one crapped out hours after install. I would regard this is a serious design issue and am glad it only operated a single light and not a more hefty such as a fan. Was only a 19watt bulb and not a 100w, 200w or greater. Throughout my lifetime I have never had any switch fail in any position off or on. Pros: Modern look & sleek design White switch color went well with decor & cover plate Tiny lights help to locate switch Indifferent: Did not find UL mark Too sensitive slight dimness can activate night light No way to shut off nightlight like some others Cons: Clicking sound is a bit louder than some others At least one was not as solidly built as initially thought - so far Can only partially recommend",

        "text": "I bought these 2 singles switches, a 2-gang box and an oversize wall plate on Amazon for a small bathroom that needed a night light to be flat against the wall and the light emitting downward. Installed the 1st switch upside down as a night light only but not turning on any other lights. So, I had to add a very small 120vac instrument pilot lamp inside the box, behind the switch, so the LEDs would have a resistive path to the neutral to illuminate. The pictures show the assembly with a fan timer next to this switch. The overhead light is switched on another wall and not ideal for where I needed the night light at the commode. When the overhead light is on or it's daylight, the sensor turns off the night light... perfect. The 2nd switch was installed in a bedroom and the nightlight is too bright for sleeping. These LEDs are turned upward to operate like a normal push top =on, push bottom =off like a normal rocker switch should be. They light up the ceiling and broadcasts everywhere. I got a small artist brush and very carefully painted black over the 4 of the 5 Led's. It's perfect now and can find the switch in the dark easily.",

I needed light down, plus who wants light to shine up into your dark-adapted eyes???! I dont, so in my install, up is off so the lever bottom can illuminate downward. Made in China, they may not pay attention to down is off, but to be honest, a Decora switch is sort of ok this way, where a standard toggle would not be. It gives very little light BUT, in our bathroom at night, we can navigate just fine and avoid turning on a bright overhead and waking everyone. I also put one in my garage, also upside down, so it lights your path, and doesnt blind you.",
