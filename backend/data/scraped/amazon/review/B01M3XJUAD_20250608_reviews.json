        "text": "The system works well. Unfortunately, the kit is frustratingly incomplete, and the instructions are flawed. This kit contains a Pico remote, which, in most cases, will replace a switch in a separate location as part of a 3-way installation. However, the kit lacks a bracket required to mount the included Pico remote where the other switch was removed. It's not something found in any local hardware store in my town. It very frustrating to finish installation to discover that all the parts needed were not included. You need the Lutron Caseta Smart Lighting Wall Plate Bracket for the Pico Smart Remote, Directly Mount Pico Remote To The Wall, 3-Way (No Wires Required), PICO-WBX-ADAPT a simple plastic part for a ridiculous $7.34. OK, the instruction are oversimplified to the point of being questionable. The instructions describe removing the old switch to replace it with the new Caseta switch and using included (cheap) wire nuts to attach the old wires to the new wires from the Caseta. As described, that's an unsafe practice. The old wires should have the bent ends removed and then have 1/2\" stripped off before using wire nuts or any other connector. They also need to describe the proper technique of using wire nuts. I suggest using 3M Performance Plus Wire Connectors, or better yet, if you're unfamiliar with how to best use wire nuts, consider something like the Ideal Electric Lever connectors.",

The hub is easy and the switches are easy to connect. What I hate about these switches are the 4 buttons. Good luck hitting the right one at night. Top one goes full bright and does NOT remember last dim level like a Zwave switch. There is no way to program this. You must hit the middle dim button and hold to the level you want. Zwave was one tap and done. After searching for this problem people have been complaining of it for 5 years. Only the switch with the middle round button can be programmed with pre set dim.

        "text": "In 2020 I lived in an older house with no neutral wires. I wanted to upgraded the lights in the living room and kitchen to smart lights, but most of the available options were expensive smart bulbs or systems that only work with neutral wires. Like everything else I purchase, I do TONS of research first. I eventually found this system and it matched my needs exactly. I purchased this kit plus a single additional dimmer to use in a 3-way switch setup. It was very easy to install, even for the 3-way switch. The included plate covers hide the screw holes giving it a more modern and clean look. It even comes with a remote. After installing the hub and switches I downloaded and installed the free mobile app. With the app you have complete control of every switch individually, thanks to the tiny hub that ties them all together using its own wireless network. The hub plugs into your wireless router so you can control your switches from anywhere over the internet. You can also create scenes and schedules to control them separately or together in groups for different scenarios. For example, sometimes I wanted to turn off the kitchen and living rooms at the same time with a single action, or turn on/off the kitchen without affecting the living room. That same year we were gifted a Google home mini. After getting that setup I was able to easily integrate the Lutron system with it. I could now says \"Hey Google, turn off all lights\", or \"set living room lights to 30 percent\". It really was a game changer not having to jump up and run across the room just to adjust the lighting. It may sound like the next step in laziness, but I saw it as the next step in productivity, as I work from home and having to stop working for a simply task was a distraction I was happy to no longer be burdened with. Other times you just want to raise the lights to find something or to clean up a spill quickly or turn the lights off for a quick nap without having to move at all. We moved into a newer home in early 2022. After my previous experience with the Lutron products I installed the existing system in the new home and expanded it, making nearly all of the switches smart Lutron switches. I even have smart outlets outside over 100 feet away from the hub to turn on and off exterior lighting as the sun rises and sets. Adding new switches and outlets is a breeze. You just install them, select them in the mobile app and push a button to pair them to the hub. I have seen a lot of newcomers to the smart switch arena in the past three years, but most still have the same limitations as in the past, such the the neutral wire requirement. Even my newer home has some switches that lack neutral wires, so Lutron is still the best option. Lutron does of course also offer many switches that do work with neutral wires, such as where you only want on/off switching without the need to dim. For those switches you do wish to use as a dimmer, make sure the bulbs you use are compatible. Incandescent as dimmable. Most newer LED bulbs are NOT dimmable, so be sure to read the box to make sure they will work with your switch. This has been a solid and outstanding system with zero issues that I have used to run my homes for the past three years. Anyone with light switches will love this system as much as I have.",

We removed all the receptacle switches and tied the wires in the box together. The. Put the pico in that spot. Now, I have the ability to control individual lamps thanks to the programming. We now have Caseta throughout the whole house, garage, and outside lights. I will recommend this product to anyone who had an older house but wants a light system. 5 stars!!!!",

        "text": "I really wanted these switches for my living room light and foyer light during my irrational \"nesting phase\" of pregnancy and I'm so glad they worked out like I thought they did! Smart switches turned out to be a better fit for us because they don't die like smart bulbs so you shouldn't have to replace them, and they still turn on with voice control or scheduled routines even if the switch accidentally gets flipped down. For installation, definitely read the instructions and follow the video. My husband and father in law tried to wing it and it took them a few hours to figure out until they followed the instructions and then it was much smoother going. Also, we incorrectly assumed that if we didn't have dimmable bulbs then that feature just wouldn't work and the switches would be limited to just on and off. We were wrong; you must have dimmable bulbs for these to work properly. With regular bulbs, they were stuck at about 25% brightness. Once we changed the bulbs, everything worked as it should. Now it is GREAT to have our lights turn on in the morning so we can see as we pack our baby up for daycare and great to have the lights on when we get home in the evenings. I set these 2 routines up with Alexa, but the Lutron app seems like it could schedule this easily as well. Being able to tell Alexa to dim, brighten, turn on/off the lights when your hands are full with a baby is a God send and I truly think this is something that should be on the radar of more parents to be. I can already see upgrading bedroom and hall and bathroom lights on for when my baby is older so everything turns on to get her up at put of bed in the morning and yet I never have to worry about lights accidentally being left on all day. I also love how the look of these has modernized the look of my 90s home.",
