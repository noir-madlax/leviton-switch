But unfortunately, there is a bright green LED below the switch rocker that illuminates when the fixture is turned off. I can literally read by unwanted glow I tried to mask this with carefully placed electric tape, but the entire ring around the switch rocker still glows bright enough to interfere with normal night-time sleep. By resorting to reading the fine print on the backside of the installation guide, i learned the programming steps to make all the LEDs, including my bright green nemesis, to turn off after 5 seconds. I have made peace with the control and bumped my rating to 5-star.",

It is really cool to say \"Hey Siri, set dining room light to half brightness\" and it happens instantly. Be sure to read the instructions carefully when installing, especially if you have a 3-way situation. I have a number of Leviton smart switches and they all work flawlessly. A couple of them shipped with old firmware and would not respond to an iPhone running ios 14 to perform the setup. Using an ipad instead worked fine. Once enrolled with the ipad, the firmware was updated and then it worked with the iphone and the rest of the Apple smart home.",

        "text": "This dimmer works very well with LED bulbs, and the coordinating remotes are great. If you have older Levition Vizia dimmers/remotes, this product is a direct replacement and solves the problem of ghosting LEDs with the older product. There is one minor flaw, however: the rocker arm toggle on the right side of the switch frequently pops out of position into \"air gap\" mode, however I have found a workaround. You need to tweak the wallplate so it buts up tightly against the right hand side of the switch, leaving a slight gap on the left hand side (see my photo). This provides support for the toggle assembly and helps prevents the plastic from flexing outwards and popping out of position during use. This is a design flaw on Leviton's part, as they designed the switch face about a millimeter too narrow. They should design a modified switch face that addresses this issue.",

The dimmer works very well with retrofitted LED lights. Unfortunately the screw terminals were not designed with ease of attachment in mind. The wires I attached them to were heavy gauge and it was difficult to attach them to the terminals. In addition, the wiring directions were not designed for use by the amateur electrician in mind. As a result it took far longer to install this than I had hoped.",

        "text": "One hour later, after what I *thought* would be a trivial install... I love the operation of this switch. The fade on effect is very nice. The \"locator\" light doubles as an intensity indicator. Typically installation should be trivial. Overall the instructions are well written. What caught me was my house wiring was \"wrong\". Quickly reading the instructions (who *critically* *studies* instructions?) it seemed obvious to screw the black wire into the black terminal and the white wire into the other (red) terminal. Oops! What they should clearly label is the black terminal should be connected to the hot wire (you should have a multi meter to test your wiring). To further compound the problem the trouble shooting section does NOT cover this situation. They give four possible causes for the problem I encountered, but failed to include the fifth possible case of the hot and neutral wires being reversed. The problem was confusing for me because a light would light up and operate if you unscrewed the light bulb and screwed it back in. (first I was using the original incandescent bulb (brain dead simple, should always work) then I switched to a new LED bulb (which is how I discovered it would light up upon initially screwing in the light bulb), then tried yet another LED bulb (which was clearly marked as compatible with dimmer switches) at that point I realized something was messed up with the switch and used my multi meter to check which wire was *actually* the hot wire. Swap the wires and presto it works perfectly. After all the hassle of getting it to work, it's tempting to only rate this three stars. But most people won't encounter this issue (most house wiring is correct, right?). Note: this switch is programmable! Programming modes A and B allow you to alter all kinds of things like fade on / off rate, maximum brightness, minimum brightness and other settings.",

        "text": "I have an older home with no real ground. Circuits are instead protected with GFCI/AFCI outlets. This has never been an issue for dimmers or switches. Traditional analog switches only require the line/load wires (black from circuit breaker and black to lighting). Digital dimmers have always used the white neutral wire for power, which allows them to be on even when the lights are not in use. This provides power for the dimming on/off animations and any \"smart\" features like Wifi or Bluetooth. This Leviton switch actually used the ground instead, which I guess is compatible with code requirements because it is low voltage. Regardless of the reason, this means that a true ground is needed. I had to use these in another home. They have now made this clearer in the description, but it is still easy to miss because it is such an odd choice, and one that I hope is not a trend. Otherwise, this is decent dimmer that works well for LED lighting. There are some basic settings to tune to dimming range, and the dimming animation makes turning on the lights less jarring.",

The DDL06-1LZ Decora Digital Dimmer features a separate On/Off switch that preserves the selected brightness setting and offers the flexibility to modify the dimming range to optimize low light level performance when required on certain LED or CFL bulbs. Its slim, compact housing fits easily into a standard wallbox and is suitable for multi-gang installations with other Decora products. Screw terminals with back wire capability add to the ease of installation. The Decora Digital Dimmer comes packaged in White with Ivory and Light Almond color change kits. Additional color change kits are available in Black, Brown and Gray. Digital Technology for Advanced Operation The DDL06-1LZ Decora Digital Dimmer has been designed to control a wide range of dimmable LED, dimmable CFL and incandescent bulbs. Users have the ability to adjust the setting for any dimmable CFL and LED bulbs requiring fine-tuning. Selectable fade rates and minimum brightness levels that let you enjoy the ideal light level day or night. Digital circuitry provides a pleasing light level, as well as 'soft on' and 'fade off' for transitions that are gentle to the eyes. For added convenience, the dimmer recalls the last set brightness level every time you push the pad to turn it on. It also features an ergonomic design, innovative contoured geometry, and a high-gloss finish. An optional LED locator light makes it easy to find the device in the dark. Save Energy and Create Ambiance For a quick, low-cost, energy-saving upgrade to your home, simply replace any standard light switch with the Decora Digital Dimmer. Dimming the lights by 25 percent reduces energy consumption by 20 percent and extends the life by four times. Energy Save Mode allows you to program a decreased maximum brightness level, so you automatically save energy every time you turn the lights on. The ability to control the light level also means you can get the perfect ambiance for any activity.",

This is a soft-touch switch, which means it doesn't have to be pushed down hard to operate. The switch will remember where you set the dimmer level, so turning it back on it will keep it at the same setting unless the user changes it. Big plus! A little green light is illuminated on the side to show what the light density is. Highly recommend.",
