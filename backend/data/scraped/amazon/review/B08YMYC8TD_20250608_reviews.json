Prior to converting the switches, we had to open the door into the laundry room and reach around the corner to flip on the lights.

I was expecting a pretty nice light to be emitted from it, with how cheap and bright LEDs are getting these days but Leviton is still stuck in the past century and only wants to rip people off. This is no brighter than the incandescent bulbs they had in some switches decades ago. I bet the bean counters at Leviton figured they'll save 2-3 cents per switch by going with the most underpowered LED they can, when sending specs to China for manufacturing these. That's why I try to avoid this company. Thanks Leviton, for letting me down once again!",

        "text": "I installed these 3-way switches at the top and bottom the the stairway to control the LED light for the stairway. As you can see from the photos, the switches work correctly, even when controlling an LED light. The light in the switch is bright and white, not a dim yellow like older types. The light in the switch does flicker a tiny bit, but it's not objectionable (at least to me) and well worth it for a switch that works correctly with LED lights.",
