        "text": "How could it be this easy... I spent way too much money on a new patio. And then at night when I flipped on my outdoor floodlights you would think I was on a nighttime airstrip. Too bright for comfort when lounging on the patio. Ahhh... I need a dimmer that I can control with my phone I said to myself. So I ordered the FEIT dimmer as can be controlled by their phone AP. or at the actual new FEIT switch. Easy install of the switch. Easy download of the phone AP. It works ! Two tips for users: Tip 1) With my first attempt to dim either at the switch or with the phone AP half of my 6 LED Floodlights flickered like crazy. I checked the bulbs and they were stamped \"dimmable\" I was suspicious though and ordered new LED FEIT (brand) floodlight bulbs. Everything works great now. Tip 2) The phone AP dims the lights with a slide bar that moves up and down. Slide down and the lights dim. Up they brighten. I had it in my head that when I fully dimmed the lights the lights would go out. Wrong. On that same phone AP slide bar image is a blue button that turns the lights on or off with a push of the button At this stage I'm trying to find more uses for this great switch.",

        "text": "Was able to complete a 4 way install with this switch pack. Basically the same way as a 3 way, the red wire in your home often the traveler is sent between the dimmers as a signal wire. So 2 of the switches are dummy \"remotes\" that tell the third switch to actually do the controlling. The Third switch in the setup has the actual load in this configuration. The manual doesn't describe how to do this but the middle switch has 2 red travelers on one side of the switch 2 black wires on the other side (hot) and of course the neutral wire. I've had these switches for years from Costco and they never gave me an issue. They're not the prettiest but they are specifically cool due to the signal wire used.",

Starting with the Z-wave/Zigbee/Smartthings mess to the much better wifi versions that everyone uses now. These are the best I have used. No wires coming out of the back and they aren't too deep, so they fit in your box. They also have dedicated dimming functions and LEDs showing how bright the dimmer is set. Easy to connect to wifi. These are the best smart switches in have used. If I was going to design the perfect smart switch, I would use this back side design with the treatlife dimmer front. (The back side of the treatlife is huge and often won't fit in the box with the wires.)",
