Dimming is smooth and there’s no blinking, but there is a decided lapse between throwing the switch and light. I’ve tested a single lamp with a simple on-off switch and there is no delay. I can’t test 7 lamps in parallel, but I suspect that the delay is due to the dimmer switch itself and not to the number being turned on.",

        "text": "if you have a home (or old wiring) built before the 80s, you probably don't have a neutral wire in your light switch box. I can confirm this switch works fine without a neutral wire and since the entire box is metal and grounded, we didn't have to connect the green ground wire either. It was as simple as connecting the two black wires on the previous switch and pushing them into this new dimmer switch (it also has screws but this is easier) I just bought the first dimmer switch that came along and see that you're pretty much paying 2x for the Lutron brand (compared to Chinese knockoffs) and that they are pretty much king of the dimmer business. If I had to do it again, I might have opted for a rotary switch but they look pretty wide in the photo - even this switch barely fit next to our existing switches (this is something to look into - open up your switch box first and see how much clearance you have on each side esp if you have 3 super skinny type switches like we did!) at end end of the day, it was easy to install, it works and have peace of mind it is going to be reliable and backed up by a reputable company!",

They have added a QR code to watch an install video to make sure you can wire it in. You should have basic electrical skills before doing this; if you do not have such skills, I would strongly recommend you search out some youtube videos on household wiring and installing switches prior to purchasing this. There is also a small blue adjustment range toggle to adjust the \"range\" of dimming on the main face of the switch. Be sure to use this prior to putting a faceplate back on the switch to see the trigger point where your LED bulbs will activate; some don't come on if the voltage is too low. Also, if dimming LED bulbs, be sure they are \"dimmer rated\", or you could have negative effects like visible strobing or overheating. If you are unsure if the bulbs are dimmer rated, then perhaps consider getting new ones that you know are, and moving the old bulbs to a fixture that will never use a dimmer.",

I also like that it fits in the existing cover and is not obtrusive. If I need another, I'll get one of these. If you have difficulty with small switches though, it's not for you. Ex. I wouldn't get these for someone with arthritis. The sliding switch is small and probably would be hard for them if they had to move it a lot.",

Sometimes with LED bulbs, especially low wattage, the brass fixture has .5w bulbs, 6 of them, the bulbs will flicker when you dim them down, but Lutron has perfected there dimmers much better now for LED bulbs, plus getting the right quality of bulbs helps as well. Both dimmers are working fantastic, well worth the $20 or so they cost. it is great to be able to dim the dining light when you want a much more comforting and romantic evening, especially without a strobe show from the bulbs flickering.",

I’m not sure why some people are complaining about the dimmer switch as if they weren’t expecting it to be as small as it is. This was my main concern before buying because my hands and fingers are fairly large. But as you can see in the video, I can work it just fine. The build quality and look and feel of the switch is about what you’d expect for $20. Dimming speed is as fast as you move it and the brightness will go to the max of your bulbs. Very happy with this purchase and will buy another one in the near future.",

As several reviews have had problems with the switch seeming to only function with the switch mounted upside down. There is a fix for that problem. For a single switch application, The solution is to properly connect the 2 wires. With the switch oriented in the up position. The power wire coming in is connected to the side of the switch with one screw. Being a 3 way design switch there are 2 output contact screws. Connect the wire going to the light fixture to the lower screw on the side with 2 screws. So if you find your having trouble with the switch functioning like it is upside down switch the wire to the light fixture to the other screw on the switch.",

        "text": "This dimmer worked fine. Some reviewers complained that it worked upside down, i.e., that the \"on\" position of the switch was down instead of up. They didn't follow the directions. They probably attached both electric wires to the same side of the switch. For a standard hook-up, not a 3-way, you are supposed to attach one electric wire to each side of the switch. Also, don't forget to adjust the little dimmer adjustment screw on the face of the switch. One morning the switch mysteriously stopped working. I eventually figured out that it was because I hadn't adjusted the screw when I installed the switch. I turned the screw clockwise a little bit and now everything is fine. Finally, note that there are some kinds of lights that the dimmer won’t work with. The dimmer did not work well with my integrated LED light. It worked well on my other lights.",
