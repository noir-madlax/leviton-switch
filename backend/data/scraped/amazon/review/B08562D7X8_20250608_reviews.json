Just remember this thing is ZWave (needed to connect to Ring Alarm) and it is a switch, not a dimmer. You want a switch that opens and closes with a relay.",

Apparently I am wrong because although I purchased a “new” unit, what I received could only be described as “open box.” To get to the point regarding the switch, the directions are clear and I had it integrated into my home Zwave network in a few minutes - and it works. It identified as a GE brand during installation (on my hub). No issues yet. I probably would have rated it 5-stars if the packaging was factory-sealed. I completely overlooked this in the description - this switch doesn’t illuminate when it’s in the off position like some others that I own do. So if this is important to you, consider a different make possibly.",

A couple of notes: 1) The model I bought is not a dimmer - just on and off - I knew that when I ordered them and they do just that 2) They are supposed to be able to sense the \"in\" and \"out\" - I had to fiddle with the wires and swap the \"in\" and \"out\" connections - it took 5 minutes. They fit in the switch box - keep in mind that ALL smart switches are bigger than a simple switch - you might have to push the wires around to make it fit. To be clear, neither of these caused any issue and are quickly handled.",

Only complaint I have that it doesn't have any status LED which I would find very useful. Also pairing was a bit problematic, I had to reset, pair, reset, pair, but eventually it went nicely with S2 security. (It may be fault of Home Assistant or unit, can't tell)",
