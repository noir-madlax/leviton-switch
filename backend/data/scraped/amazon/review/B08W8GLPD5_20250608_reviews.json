Firstly, there is another (more expensive) listing that makes it look like there is another version of this device (dimmer switch) that does work without a Hue bridge while this one must be used with a bridge. Both of these are untrue. I can attest that this device can indeed control Hue lights directly via bluetooth. The control might be a bit more limiting than with the bridge, but I haven't found it to be a problem at all. Additionally, from my research, there is only one version of this device so you might as well buy it off the cheaper listing. The Philips documentation could definitely be better as to pairing without a bridge, but I think most people will be able to get there. Once paired, I've been quite pleased with the set in operation.",

Also, it seems to only remember the default light settings where I'm not able to program my custom color settings that are in the HUE software. If it does allow this, it is just hard to get it to work. Again, having the switch is great, I just with Phillips would debug there software, plus make it easier to program the themes easier.",

It would be nice to have double presses, and I wish Alexa routines would allow for lowering and raising brightness by a certain amount instead of changing to a set amount, one of which I hope Philips sees as feedback and changes and the other I hope for Amazon to see. That small critique aside, it's great to have a generic switch that can be used for anything! I'm not a big fan of having to have a hub, but of all hubs to get Philips Hue is probably the most well-known to go for anyway. 10/10 recommend this product for triggering Alexa Routines using matter!",

I highly recommend this product if you are in the market for a simpler, more practical location for a light switch. It is very light weight and easy to install.",

        "text": "I have four version 1 Philips Hue dimmer switches. They work great and come with a magnet backed base plate. This version 2 dimmer has a couple of design changes. The V1 on switch now functions as an on/off switch. The V1 off swith is now designated for Scenes and will cycle through them with each press. The base plate is slightly larger on this version than the V1 ( New swith also has rounded corners - which means you can't use old V1 wallplates with V2 switches ). Even though the Philips website claims the wallplates will connect to magnetic surfaces e.g. fridges. The V2 does not have magnets. It only has peel off adhesive strips. If it still had magnets it would get 5 stars. Devices is great. The design is lacking.",

        "text": "After using numerous smart lighting options from different manufacturers it's clear that Philips Hue is above & beyond all others for ease & reliability. Aside from the outrageous cost of the sync box, almost everything is worth paying a little more for. Then I got this V2 dimmer switch. Works well like all other hue devices except for one glaring issue. Apparently Philips thought it would be a good idea to remap the buttons with no apparent way to change that. So now when I want to turn off my dimmed lights I press the bottom button like on my other 4 switches & I'm drowning in lighting at it's brightest setting. Trying to remember which version switch I'm using is annoying to the point that I will try to find an old V1 switch and return this. My question to Philips - is this a ploy to frustrate your customers into upgrading all their dimmer switches? Please fix this.",

It works reliably but sometimes you need to double press the button for it to register, which is a mild nuisance. I like that it magnetizes to its wall holder so you can pick it up off the wall, but overall I would expect a more polished experience on the software and function side given how expensive this product and Phillips Hue are as a whole.",

That said, after using them for a few months, the user experience is one of the worst I've ever seen in a tech product. Together with the app, they were clearly designed by someone who has never used a standard light switch before. One example, when configuring the \"on/off\" button on the top, you can either have it so a button press turns the lights on, OR turns the lights off. ***there's no way to do both!!*** The whole reason I bought these was to avoid having to fumble with my phone all the time to manage lights, but so far I've spent just as much time trying to force their square peg into a round hole. Altogether an endlessly frustrating product, but unfortunately still pretty much the only option.",
