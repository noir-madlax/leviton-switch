Who buys a bulb and decides that they never want the bulb to actually display full brightness? Why not just buy a lower lumen output bulb and save some money. The engineer that did this should have a forced career change and clean streets (of course then the hard working people that do that would have to put up with this persons ineptitude.)",

        "text": "I installed this to control a new set of four overhead 4ft LED fixtures with 0-10V dimming. Wiring them up was pretty simple... normal hot/neutral/ground wires, plus daisy chaining the 0-10V wires between the switch and each fixture. Two complaints though... first, the price seems too high, in my opinion. I wanted the dimming, so I paid the price, but something tells me it shouldn't be as high as it is just for that dimming feature. Then again, something is worth as much as people are willing to pay, so... The other complaint was that until I put the cover plate on, the replaceable faceplate on it kept popping off. I had installed the switch in a double-gang box and until I hooked up the other switch, I didn't have the Decora plate installed. Meanwhile, I was running some other wires in nearby locations, and everytime I'd hammer a wire staple into a stud, the smallest vibrations would make that cover pop right off. It's just not held on very well. It's plastic so it didn't break when it fell to the floor, but still, it seemed chintzy for such an expensive switch. Of course once the cover is installed over the switch, that holds it in place just fine so it's not ultimately a big deal, but it sure was frustrating until then. The dimming itself works well. It's fairly smooth, and the full brightness matched the brightness of the fixtures when I tested them out with a non-dimming switch, as best I could tell. The lowest dim level will depend on your specific fixtures, and I have nothing to compare on that front, but it dims pretty low so I'm satisfied. I have this wired in a 3-way configuration (to a non-dimming switch) so that part of the switch works fine too - it does support 3-way just fine with the traveler wires.",

My only bump against it is that it comes with 3 different pop on face plates for different colors (white, beige and cream). Ordinarily I would say choice is good, but I would have preferred to buy the color I need and not pay the extra for the unused faced plates. I know why they do it, just think it would be more efficient to sell 1 dimmer and select what face plate you need.",

        "text": "It has been a month long battle trying to get a Leviton 0-10V dimmer that works, but after the fourth try we have success. The first two were the new Renoir II version that had no response. I have used this dimmer in the past, but wanted to have the nicer Renoir II. Well I guess Leviton needs to go back to the design board on that. I received my first Illumatech and installed to find that it only dimmed from about 10% to 30% on the fixture. Got the voltmeter out and found that it only went from .5V to 3.5V. Got a third return from Amazon which has been quick and excellent on taking care of these problem dimmers. I received my fourth one today, installed and finally success. Major kudos to Amazon for their great handling of problems, big complaints for Leviton either not designing or building products that work consistently.",
