        "text": "Our church remodel doesn't have a common at the switches so these Lutron's were required for automation. Wired up the porch light specifically to use the Dawn to Dusk program. Wired the chapel lights to separate switches for East & West walls, ceilings, and foyer. We programed them all for Away mode while we traveled to New Zealand and Australia for three weeks. Our friends and neighbors never knew we were out of town. Controlling individual switches from my phone is great... Even when away. I bought two kits that included a hub so there would be a spare. Hub works great. Happy the frequency is not on the wifi. Haven't upgraded switches upstairs yet so can't say how the hub will perform through floors. All our bulbs are LED with at least two per circuit and they all work great including the dimming feature.",

I installed the app on my phone as well as the bridge at home on my desk (room where I have the dimmer). The pico remote is working only 35-40% of the time. Lots of time, when the lights are off and you wish to turn them on, when I press the pico remote to turn them on, nothing happen. I see the small LED on the side of the dimmer switch on the wall going up to say it is on, and in the Lutron app, it says the lights are on, but in reality, lights are off. The only way to turn the lights on is to go to the wall switch and turn on from there which defy the purpose of a remote. Don't know if it has interferences with my computer system on the desk but the remote is useless. Loss of money.",

With this kit you get the dimmer and remote that by themselves work independently from the caseta app. The wireless hub is included in this kit and if used allows you to control the lights from anywhere in the world via the app. The user interface is simple to setup and easy to use. This allows you to setup schedules, scenes and events. It also allows the light switch to be integrated with alexa, the ring doorbell and a handful of other thermostats. I have 6 other caseta switches on the hub with no connection issues what so ever. Another great feature of the caseta dimmer is that it also acts as a signal repeater for the hub. Lutron sells a repeater as well if you're having connection issues due to distance.",

I used a self tapping screw in the metal junction box and ran the ground wire to it. I used it to replace my C by GE which was plagued with issues. I only dock one star as the C by GE had less buttons but a much better switch interface that allowed you to turn on the light to the brightest, lowest or last setting depending on which of the big and easily visible buttons. There are 4 buttons on the Lutron and you only have the option to turn on the brightest or lowest settings. Only the Pico remote with 5 buttons allow you to return to a preset setting. There is no reason for a separate on and off button in my opinion.",

        "text": "I have a mix of traditional Maestro Lutron switches when we remodeled our home some 20 years ago. Over the years, the Lutron switch mechanism started failing so has been looking for a replacement. Few years ago started switching some of the switches to GE Zwave switches and integrated them with Samsung SmartThings and/or ADT Pulse; and added them to Alexa via SmartThings integration. I am now planning to replace the legacy Maestro switches to a new smart switch technology and also replace the GE Zwave siwtches as well. I considered various WIFI based switches, but ended up settling on Lutron Caseta technology because WIFI switches were a pain and not very responsive. Almost all other smart switches needed a neutral switch and most of them didn't support SmartThings, Apple Homekit, etc. I was looking for a technology that could work with all major smart hubs and wouldn't require a neutral wire. Lutron Caseta works great. The price is high, but it works like a charm. I just received my Lutron Caseta hub+dimmer+pico and took me a total of 15 minutes to install the dimmer and configure the Lutron IOS App. I added the new devices to Lutron, linked to my SmartThings and scanned the AppleKit label and everything got added automatically to my existing room grouping. But Lutron Caseta pricing is just too expensive considering the upcoming technology which is a major downside.",

The install experience via the iOS Lutron app is probably the worst I have ever experienced for ANY smart home or internet connected device, showing me countless errors (the attached screenshot is just one of them) and providing zero real guidance on how to resolve any of them.

The fans are located on our back patio and we hardly use them so we don’t use the switches too often. However, I got them so that I could turn on the fan/light from anywhere (more so for when we are outside and I don’t want to go inside to hit the switch). The app responds quickly and it is a great alternative to having remote controls for every switch in the house. Instead, it’s all in one app in one place. Also, I set up our Alexa to control these which is a neat feature. Side note on the included bridge: The instructions say to plug this directly into the router. I have a network switch and have this bridge plugged into the switch, which then is routed to my wireless router. I have had zero problems so it appears being plugged into the switch is just fine.

I had internet near the garage so we just installed a 2nd bridge. Thus far the entire system has worked well. Just make sure you want Caseta and not the Radio RA or RA2 systems . I started with Caseta because that's what I saw in the local hardware store and it wasn't until I was well into this system that I leared more about alternative \"higher end\" Lutron systems. With that said. I've been pleased with the Caseta system as a whole as it currently meets my needs. Unclear if I would have gone RadioRA2 or Caseta if I learned about them at the same time.",

Good news, this Was my first official electrical project, including mounting and connecting this to the Edison light fixture to which this controls - and, didn’t burn the complex down or get jolted with electricity! Go team! Seriously though, it’s pretty simple and super effective. Thanks",

        "text": "Installation: Installation was a breeze for the most part, however for working with a 3way implementation the directions did not come with this packaging and I did have to get on Lutron website to find them. Found that the directions were vastly similar, but not identical, to the majestro product line which these Caseta switches were replacing. Also NO COMMON WIRE NEEDED, oh this is so nice for a smart switch product line! Lutron, I tip my hat to you! Bravo!!! General Impression: After trying several brands and having mixed to horrible results I decided to try the Lutron Caseta line. Well now my house is filled with the line. Absolutely wonderful product line with awesome Alexa integration. The integration was seamless once enabling the skill via the Alexa app. I do recommend this system. Since the installation it has been ROCK SOLID. No major issues with firmware upgrade, there has been zero lost connectivity issues and/or switches not responding. The product is absolutely prime time ready unlike so many of the competitors out there. Initially I was on the fence against having another smart home product that required a hub but at the same time this tech isn't impeding on my WIFI coverage and also has a very surprising range in my 2,200 sq ft home. The hub itself is sleek and looks nice sitting my shelf o tech things. I Cannot Break It: I've done rigorous testing with the product trying to cause a failure and have had no issues. Testing has including loss of power and ETH connection several times over. It always comes back online. The only thing that I can kinda gripe but not really, is the time the hub takes to come back online with the app when power is hard lost. It can be upwards of 5 minutes, but all in all. That is the only thing I can truly find wrong with the hub. Compared to previous experiences with other vendors this is by far the most well construed smart switch ecosystem I've ever had the joy of playing with. The App: The App is very well designed and works perfectly. It easy to add custom schedules and the switches to the hub via the app. Overall a 5 star experience there. Other competitors have some of the most awful apps that I've ever used. However Lutron has set the bar! It is fast, it is responsive and most importantly it is STABLE! Wish List! The only thing that I would want out of the product line is an all in one fan/light smart switch. This type of switch is truly lacking from the smart switch market and living in the southern states of the United States there are ceiling fans in all rooms. This is my last great hurdle for an all in one smart switch ecosystem. Currently this product line, as of 08/23/2019, does offer a fan control switch but it does not control the light. You have to have a dual gang box and install two switches, one for the fan and one for the light. This is less than ideal for my situation. Overall I highly recommend this product line, it has been headache and frustration free since installing and I've been adding to the lutron ecosystem gradually and now have 8 switches working like a smart home dream come true.",
