Now can turn on/off all of my lights in house via Alexa while sitting in my easy chair, or light up my house over the internet while I'm away. Great system. BUT, don't be fooled with their propaganda that light switches are \"easy to install\". Even if you're knowledgeably about \"neutral wires\", etc, the instructions will NOT really help you if you've got anything other than a plain vanilla install. The instructions for the wall switch are really for the Pico remote. And in my case, I had 5 wires coming into my old swtch, but the instructions only are relevant for 4 wires. And don't expect their YouTube videos to help much either. They are redundant and not relevant. But after spending 3 hours, I was able to install the new dimmer switch and add it and two Pico remotes to my existing Lutron Caseta system. And I love it!!!!",

We planned on using this so we could switch a door swing and have the remote on the other side of the door, because I’ve been told by multiple electricians there isn’t enough room to put a box on the other side of the door. Mostly bummed because I spaced returning it before we went out of town. So now I’m out money with a switch that doesn’t work.",

We had an electrician install a new ceiling fan and had the neutral wire run at the time so was able to do the fan and light separately. Works great and looks great. Different colors so I wouldn’t have to look too closely.",

        "text": "Just recently switch to Lutron product line, and my fan switch install went flawless. I installed this switch on my outdoor lights and learned a lot along the way. Hopefully this will help someone else. - When I installed the switch, I have neutral wires in my gangboxes (house built in 2000), and was shocked that this switch didn't have a neutral connection. You don't need it for this switch, which is great for those that don't have the wire, but it was a first for me as my Zwave switches always needed it - Switch was installed correctly, but had no lights on the switch itself, and while I noticed my outdoor porch lights were showing a dimly lit bulb, hitting the on or off on the switch did nothing. I was convinced initially it was wiring, but lo and behold, the true issue was the bulbs that I installed. I had purchased some cheap no-name brand LED bulbs and they were not dimmable (I think). Upon changing the bulb, the switch showed operational lights, and everything worked fine. In my two fixtures, I initially only changed one, and that was all it took to get it working. I confirmed the same issue when I installed another switch for my 3 deck post lights. Changing a bulb to a dimmable bulb (while I wait for matching replacements) was all I needed to do to get it to work! - Pico remotes are amazing, and can be used for many different things. Love that I don't need hardwired Z-wave accessory switches anymore, and these make it so less crowded in a multi-gangbox! Highly recommend those looking to make the switch from Zwave, WiFi and other lower quality switches. I will say my Zwave installation was flawless in operation, but ultimately got sick of the low quality and frequent failures. Anyone considering a \"WiFi\" switch should not do so, but I'm not going to gain much in functionality over my Zwave switches, the reliability and Picos are the big pluses.",

        "text": "I have used these on remodels for customers but first in my own home. Our dining room light should have been wired with a 3-way switch, I even had the wall opened at one point on one side, but where the switch was on the other side, I would have had to tear that wall open too, in order to feed 14 3-wire to it. With this dimmer and Pico dimmer problem solved in 20 minutes if replacing a one gang switch with the dimmer and mounting the remote on a wall by itself. My set up took longer because I changed out 3 toggle switches for all deco switches. So had to install all deco wall plates; one a 2 gang the other a 4gang (Pico) remote. Pricing was good as well Box stores sell this kit in store for the same price, but it does not include the wall bracket. They charge an addition 8 for it. Shipping incredibly fast, ordered it in the box store late afternoon was at my door by 10:54 am. the next day. I COULD NOT find in the included instruction sheets how to pair it. But simple Press and hold off button on wired switch till lights blink, release. Press and hold off button on remote till lights blink 3 times on wired unit, release done. You can add a hub so you can have voice activation I don't need that just glad we now have switches on both sides of the dining room.",

        "text": "I used to use the Maestro switches (with remote), but they didn’t work once I changed to LED bulbs. I don’t always have neutrals available (power runs to the light and then to the switch instead of vice versa), so I can’t use the smart switches. I put one in my husband’s office; he likes to be able to dim the lights remotely. I have another in the bedroom (with two remotes). This allows us to turn off (or on) the bedroom light from bed without having things rewired to install four-way switches. I have a third in the laundry room; the room is inconveniently designed because it’s under the stairs, and my storage shelf covered the light switch— so, I installed a Caseta switch and put a remote on an uncovered wall area. This is a much cheaper solution than having someone custom-build a cabinet for my under-stair storage wall, and, so far, it’s been great. There are probably other places I could put this, but, if I don’t need a remote, I prefer the slider on the Diva dimmer switch.",
