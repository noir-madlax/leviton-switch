Hooked it up and switched it quickly on and off. didn't seem to work. Then I realized there must be some built-in electronics because there is a one second delay between switching it on and the lights turning on. Used incandescent lights. Once one gets used to that it works fine otherwise. Maybe electronics is the way they all are nowadays. That's probably why they are all more pricy that 2-way switches. My old switch has stranded pigtails that made it easy to hook up with wire nuts, This one has holes to insert the wires and screws to tighten them down. The wires come loose very easily so you really need to tighten those screws EXTREMELY tight.",

        "text": "I bought this to replace a worn-out dimmer switch of the same type. But this one has a 1 to 2 second delay when turning on the light. Long enough to question if it actually clicked on or not. For the first couple days after installing it, I would click it on, pause, then click it again, thinking maybe it didn't work the first time (which would switch it off again). Now I just click it and stand by it shaking my head in anger in the poor craftsmanship of the switch until it finally comes on. It's very aggravating. But it turns off instantly. It's only an issue when turning it on. The old switch didn't do that. The old switch also had a lot more dimming range too. I already knew to never buy a GE appliance, because they only last 4 years tops, but I figured General ELECTRIC would be an ok brand for electric components. It is substantially an all around lesser quality craftsmanship than Leviton dimmer switches. I don't expect it to last even a year (the Leviton switch that it replaced was 12 years old). Plus the knobs that were included were totally different than the ones in the picture, which isn't a big deal, but worth mentioning. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it is a semi-functional device, but it is a very cheaply made switch that I would not recommend wasting your money on. Spend the extra few dollars and get the far superior Leviton switch instead.",

There are slots in the back that also can be used to fasten the wires, but there is no way to lock the wires into the slots. The face is also not recessed, so the cover plate sits proud of the wall. I was disappointed in the design and engineering of this switch. When I turned it on, the bulbs began blinking. I don't know if I got a defect or if this is the way they all are.

Apparently, this was a cost reduction design. First this was advertised as a 3-way, multiple switch design. It turned out you can use it also for single-switch application. Just have one wire less. It does not come with the wires shown in photo's nor wire nuts. This is where it gets complicated. You have to use the wires you have in the wall and directly connect them to the new dimmer. They actually are pushed into holes and clamped in by tightening the screw terminals. In my case I only have 3 wires and different colors than shown on the dimmer switch. Didn't have a ground wire. I was able to figure out which wires go where, by looking how they were connected to old dimmer switch that had wire nuts. My house is 50 y/o so you might have a different setup. Somone has to change the pictures on posting as they will be different than the old design. Good Luck.",

The lights are dimmable led and the sounds comes from the switch, not the lights. The 3 way switches cannot dim less than 50% or else the lights start to strobe. Also, if you dim the one switch and go to the second switch you cannot increase the light past where the first switch is set to. Basically making the concept of a 3 way dimmer unless. I guess it's a classic case of you get what you pay for. BTW, I'm a professional maintenance worker who's train in the electrical trade. In my professional opinion these switches are junk.",
