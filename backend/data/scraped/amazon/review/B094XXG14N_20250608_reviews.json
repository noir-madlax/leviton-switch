        "text": "At roughly $9 bucks each these are a very good value. They dim the lights. They are no harder to install than any other switch. I've installed about a dozen in my new (used) home, both single and double pole. Cons - 1. There is a bit of delay in both on/off and the response to changes. You get used to that easily. 2. The sensitivity is not fully linear, nor particularly good. Controlling the dim at a specific level other than min and max takes some effort. The above mentioned delay does not help. 3. One of my switches does have a slight buzz to it - this switch serves 320 watts of incandescent bulb in an archaic light bar in my master bath. A trivial annoyance. 4. A couple of my switches have a bit of flickering at certain levels of brightness. One example is my pantry. Not a problem as this is a min/max application - min for late night snack searches. max otherwise. 5. I'm not particularly fond of the tiny white lights, but that's just my opinion. Notes - 1. I can't address whether the minor buzz or flickering is a result of cheap/defective switch or the nature of the load. 2. There is a very simple method of assigning the minimum dim level. Use it. Otherwise you will often find the lights appear 'off' when they are in fact 'on' but the minimum dim level does not illuminate them. Conclusion - Installing $30+ name brands would have cost me about $400. This job cost me about 1/4 that. I'll probably replace a couple of mine with higher quality switches where it matters. The master bath and dining room are are good examples. The rest serve their purpose quite well and are a bargain.",

First I thought it could be my 125 amp breaker for my sub panel was bad because it make the buzzing noise (kind of disturbing, you can hear the noise clearly even the ceiling fan is on). So I replace my 125 amp breaker. But, it didn't fix the problem. I then turn off both first dimmer switches that I installed, then the buzzing noise stopped at the dimmer switches and the breaker. It's very much the dimmer is defected. Another issue is when you turn the dimmer low, the light started flickering and very disturbing. Now I am stuck with eight more dimmer switches which are useless. Should I waste my time to try out the rest of dimmer switches? More likely they all bad.",

They replaced the cost within two days. I was impressed. I will give them another shot down the road when they improved their product.",

I have the locator lights turned on in hallways and living spaces, but keep them turned off for bedrooms. The electrical connections are my preferred design where a two straight conductors can be inserted and the internal clamp holds onto them. The line and load terminals take 2 conductors. The ground terminal only takes one conductor. It supports installation in a three-way circuit.",
