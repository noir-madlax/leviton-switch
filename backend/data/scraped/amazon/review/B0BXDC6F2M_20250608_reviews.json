        "text": "Having recently purchased a new house, I have been making some updates and wanted to replace the standard light switches with paddle switches. With a three switch staircase setup, I was looking for a 4-way switch, I was given the chance to try this one from ThunderWay. At first appearance, these switches look great. Installing was super easy and I found that they controlled the lights perfectly. They respond quickly turning on and off and the switch is very smooth with a definitive click into place when turning on and off. My only small criticism, as demonstrated in my video, is that the switch doesn't sit flush on the bottom. There is a little wiggle room that I have not had with other switches that I have installed in my house. It is a very small thing and not something that people would generally notice but it is something that should be improved. (Note: the crooked seating in the video is not due to the switch but rather the electrical box). All-in-all, I think this is a great option if you are in need of a double pole / 4-way switch, especially given the fact you are given 2 switches for under $20. I will probably replace the face plate with a more stylish, screwless option. But for the price and with its functionality, this is a great option.",

A 4-way switch connects or disconnects two pairs of terminals. 4-way switch is needed if more than two switches control one light: two switches should be 3-way and all additional ones should be 4-way. Good switches test no continuity between terminals when disconnected and almost 0 ohms when connected. The 4-way switches looks like good quality upon physical examination. They test perfect functionally, as expected. Overall price is reasonable for two switches with cover plates.",

It helped that these were the exact same color as well. The difference now is that the old ones had dirt and grime as well as being loose when turning the switch on and off. The new switch very audibly \"clicks\" and is very is also very crisp in its action of pushing the switch on and off. These seem decent for the price they're asking. I woke recommend.",

These oddly named units from China look and feel much like the lower cost tier ones you can find at local building supply stores. So far they are working fine, but in the future I honestly will stick to buying premium grade units from well-known brands. The labor of changing these things out is more consequential than the purchase cost, so take that into account in your decision.",

        "text": "I quickly replaced my old ivory colored toggle style 4 way switches with these nice-looking decorator style switches. Wiring is simple, just pay attention to which terminals are marked in and out as they may have a different orientation to your existing switches. You can clamp your wire ends pushed in straight under the screw terminal, which I must believe is safer than the stab in kind, or you can secure them wrapped under the screw head in the traditional way. The switch has a nice positive click to it, and the cover plate is of good quality, though I prefer the kind with the hidden screws. Easily comparable to the big box store offerings.",

It is possible to leave it in a partially-on position, which is not good. I don't like how it feels and it doesn't give me confidence, but it does work. It is UL listed.",

I am used to a 4 way being labeled as in and out as either the top two terminals are in and bottom out or one side is in and the other out. I didn't see these as being labeled but interestingly enough as I am looking at the pictures for this review, I now see on the back way at the bottom it say IN on one side and Out on the other. As for the switch. It is a good switch. Seems well made. It isn't a silent switch but not really loud either. Just a normal switch sound when you push it. Getting two for the price is a good deal. Comes with basic plates that work but nothing special.",
