They're expensive, so you can do the math in terms of what makes more sense to you: replacing LED bulbs more often, or buying a reverse-phase dimmer one time so that the bulbs last longer.",

        "text": "If you have low voltage under the counter led lights that buzz when you dim them, this EL dimmer may solve the problem. This dimmer is design to be used with led lights that use an \"electronic\" transformer to step down the voltage from 120 volts to 12-24 volts. These under the counter lights are often daisy chained with snap out wires. If you use the standard box store TRIAC dimmers they will buzz. TRIAC dimmers are \"leading edge chopping\" dimmers that chop up the leading edge of the AC sine wave. They do not play well with electronic transformers. This is a more expensive dimmer that cuts out the trailing edge of the sine wave and is better tolerated by electronic transformers. This dimmer requires a neutral wire in your switch box unlike the TRIAC dimmer. This dimmer does not play well with old school \"magnetic\" transformers that use a pair of wire coils to lower the voltage. You need to confirm that your switch box has a neutral wire so I give this product three stars for ease of install. This dimmer is also much more expensive than its CL cousin so I give it three stars for value. If you just want to get rid of the hum, you should be able to remove your TRIAC dimmer and replace it with a standard on off switch.",

        "text": "I’ve gone through three or four different digital dimmers to control a stairway LED can light that draws a max of 9 volts at full power. Every other dimmer flickered irritatingly or did not turn off the fixture completely in the off position, since the small trickle of voltage used to operate the fancy dimmer switch was also enough to cause the fixture to glow at night. This model is not digital and it DOES require a neutral wire. You will also need sufficient depth in your wall box, this switch is as deep as standard digital dimmers, about 1 1/2” deep into the wall. Also important, if using in a 3-way (or 4-way) configuration, the dimmer MUST be installed on the load side (I.e., the outlet closest in the circuit to the light fixture, not the end that has the hot wire). Luckily, my wall box had a neutral wire. Unluckily, I would have preferred the dimmer to be on the other end of the 3-way circuit. But it turns out the location was not an issue once it was installed. I’ve done (too much) research on low voltage LED dimmers, and apparently this is the only model currently on the market (early 2021) that reliably works with LED lights of all voltages. I concede that some smart dimmers will also work with low voltage LEDs, but you’ll still need a neutral wire, and as for me, I didn’t need Alexa to control a side staircase light 😛. Yes, it’s expensive. But I just sucked it up; it works where other models failed. Thanks, Lutron! Now lower your prices!",

This was for a dining room fixture that hangs low and would kill the mood. So here I am spending 2.5x the cost of the first switch to get this second one but I am happy to report this fixes the humming problem! Honestly a $75 switch is insane, but cheaper than trying 6 new good looking LED bulbs. If you are in an older place, be forewarned that you need 5 wires to make this work in a 3-way (2 switch) configuration. Lucky for me there was a neutral wire jammed all the way in the back. I have no idea how the wires work, I have never installed a complicated switch like this one before, but if you read the instructions it should go easy enough. I also found it helpful to take pictures of everything before I started helping me keep the wiring straight since everyone likes to color code things differently... Took a star off for price, but the product is great.",

After a number of very expensive LED fixtures failed (fortunately under warranty) the lighting store told me to get this type. Now the fixtures dim properly and don't hum at all. They cost more but actually work right for low power LED fixtures. All dimmers seem to clip the sine wave (PWM), but these clip the trailing side, not the leading side so the fixture does not get a high voltage surge. Instead it comes on smooth and cuts off at the end. Had to do a lot of reading to figure this out. Even the Lutron site is vague about what is going on so I may be missing some details. Works with the PIXE panels that HD used to carry. I suspect they had too many returns from use with the wrong dimmer type. Now that fixture dims properly without humming too.",

Anyways, there weren't very many options at the time, so I just went with HD's 75W ecosmart bulbs in bright white. The original dimmer at that location was an incandescent Diva, so I thought the Diva C.L. was all I needed since it says it's for LED's. The dimming worked fine but there was a very noticeable buzzing (at least to me, the significant other told me I was going crazy). I thought maybe it was just the bulbs. HD recently started carrying Feit bright white bulbs so I tried those in 75W and there was still a bit of buzzing but a little less than the ecosmarts. I finally decided to try out this dimmer as a last resort, but it should have been first. The ecosmart bulbs did indeed still buzz like another reviewer said, but when I changed them to the Feits I couldn't believe my ears. I could actually hear myself think while sitting directly under the bulbs. I don't even know why the other dimmers say they're LED compatible. Do yourself a huge favor and start off with the ELV version,",

        "text": "After reading several articles as well as many Amazon reviews, I decided the steep price tag on this switch would be worth it to fix the buzz from my LED bulbs (EcoSmart 11W from HD). I had very high hopes, but unfortunately it did not help the buzz one bit. The switch and dimmer function just fine, but I do think it has somewhat of a cheap feel as has been noted in some reviews. Install was easy, but it does take up a lot of space in the box so you have to be very efficient with getting wires situated properly. The switch itself is very deep and it has 5 pre-installed wires rather than screws to attach to (all are used for a 3-way). A neutral is required so make sure you have one in the box where you are installing before you buy.",

I love the lights and the design is superior, but I hated the buzz/ hum that I was getting from the lights with my original 15 year old dimmer switch. I didn't want to give up my lights (yet), so I ordered another new dimmer that stated it was for LED lights, the Lutron model: DVWCL-153PH-WH, White. It still buzzed, so I called FEIT Electric directly and they were so kind to send me one of their own dimmer switches for free. I installed the FEIT dimmer switch, and it was a bit better, but still buzzed. I still wasn't ready to give up the great lights, so I tried this last and most expensive switch, because I had read a post somewhere that an Electronic Low Voltage (ELV) switch almost always solved the light buzzing problems... it did! I highly recommend this switch to eliminate LED light buzz. Just keep in mind you need a Neutral wire (white in my case) in the electrical box to connect to.",

Nothing like what I was getting before. I'm using EcoSmart brand in-ceiling LED can lights. The dimming is much more fine tuned and predictable compared to the cheaper CL models. No flicker at low voltage. Highly recommend. Note that you will need a neutral wire with this dimmer, so check your outlet first!.",

Reviews of the lights warned using cheaper dimmers would cause this. Tried two 150w $30/each dimmers which helped but still had some buzzing. This Lutron 300w dimmer did the trick. No buzz or flicker. It is a little deeper and wider than most others so if you have a shallow wall box or have a lot of wires inside the box it may be a little tough to fit this dimmer all the way in. I had to trim all excess wire lengths to give enough depth for this switch. A deeper box would also have worked fine.",

These dimmers do require that your house be wired with a white neutral cable. I opened up the wall panel before ordering to make sure we had the white wires. Everything worked out fine, except that I did get two of my blacks crossed on the dimmer's red and yellow cables. I did read that if you cross them, your lights might flicker. As it turns out, the lights weren't flickering but the dimmer's amber night light was. The other dimmer was fine, so on a hunch I switched the blacks and the flickering stopped. Nice product and decent instructions (they made sense to someone with zero electrical experience).",

It does not completely, silently dim LED fixtures, except at the lowest setting, hums at all other settings. Go to Lutron's site, and it's very difficult to determine from the information present whether or not this device is correct for LEDs -- if not, what the hell should one use to silently dim LED fixtures? I'm basically OK with it, but at the price paid, it should work PERFECTLY.",

        "text": "Works exactly as needed to dim my fixtures. 08-07-2023 Updated comments: I have used Lutron dimmers for 50 years, most recently, LED dimming needs as the technology has evolved. I've received several e-mail queries from other Amazon members regarding if this dimmer will work with their light fixture and/or LED bulb. I highly recommend that if you're wondering if this dimmer (or any other Lutron dimmer) will work for your lighting project, that you call Lutron customer service before buying. They are very helpful, and will ask you what dimmer model you're buying, what light fixture you're installing, what LED/incandescent/flourescent light bulb manufacturer and product number you're thinking of using, whether it's line or low voltage installation, and then they'll tell you if it will work. If they think you should use a different dimmer model or light bulb, they will tell you the exact model number of Lutron dimmer you need to purchase to ensure 100% compatibility. Leviton also has a similar customer service department (or did when I was actively installing dimmers). One other suggestion I strongly suggest you follow when installing low-voltage rated dimmers: TURN OFF THE CIRCUIT BREAKER that controls the line voltage feed to the wall switch/junction box you're installing the switch. Unfortunately, it's very easy to burn out the dimmer while installing it if all power feed to it isn't turned off first. While prices have come down over the years for these low-voltage rated dimmers, they're still quite expensive compared to the ordinary ones you're used to using around your house. Thanks for reading, and I hope my updated comments help you.",
