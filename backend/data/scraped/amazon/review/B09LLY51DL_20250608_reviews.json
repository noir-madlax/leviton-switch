        "text": "Everything is cool except a few small changes Iâ€™d recommend to the manufacturer. 1. The switch base is really big which makes the connections difficult to put in the electrical box. Hopefully technology improves and the switch box will get smaller in later models. 2. Itâ€™s difficult to see which switches are on or off when multiple switches in 1 box. Make the light brighter on the switch symbol when the light is on. 3. The timer doesnâ€™t allow dimming.",

Plus, the dimming portion of the switch can be a bit finicky to set desired brightness, but they are used primarily through the app for automation purposes. Installation is what you'd expect from this kind of product. There is a bit of an issue with room in the box because of the extra pigtails and wire nuts, but doable.",

        "text": "The touch plate for dimming seems like a good idea, but it's not. When you first enter a room the light switch is, typically, not visible and you reach over to flip/press the switch to turn on the lights. Well, with this dimmer, if you don't press the very bottom of the switch you are going to just get whatever random dimming level you happen to be touching. At night this is annoying because I don't want the bathroom to come on full-intensity if I get up in the middle of the night. It's a design that just doesn't work in the practical world. Other than that, it works fine.",

One stopped working completely, and the other still functions manually, but no longer has any Wi-Fi connection. In both cases, yes, I have disconnected from power and reconnected to attempt to reset it completely but they simply don't work anymore. With two of them going bad so quick. I'm confident the other two will soon as well. Dropping my rating to one star for something so short-lived. Original Review: See my quick video review. I use these in four different rooms in my basement - all four working great. Dimming capacity and effectiveness will depend on your lights as much or more than this dimmer. That said, I don't get super dim light at the lowest setting with any of the lights I have (and I'm using this dimming switch with 3 different manufactures of lights). Super easy to add a switch, name it, and control it form the Smart Life app on Android, and easy to add to Google Home once you've done that. Hope it's obvious if you're here reading reviews that you'll need some electrical knowledge, tools, and experience - or need to hire an electrician to install this for you. Highly recommended.",

        "text": "With my house being built in 1990 and having done previous wiring projects, I ordered these with confidence knowing that I had a neutral wire. These came well packaged and upon opening saw there was a well made complete set for fully replacing existing switches including cover plates and new wire nuts. I cut power and went to the first switch I wanted to replace. Upon opening the cover and pulling the switch I saw that there was only one wire coming in to the box. This can't be right, normally there is a power feed wire coming from the bottom of the box and a distribution wire going to the light at the top of the box. What weird set-up was this? Turns out several of my switches are \"end of run\". This means that power goes to the light fixture first instead of the switch and what should be your neutral wire is now a hot return wire. This set-up will NOT work with these dimmers as they rely on the neutral to supply power to the switch itself so it can stay in contact with Alexa and the phone app/router. Sadly, I was not able to connect these to all of the lights I had intended. This was in no way the fault of the product and I will be using two of the four dimmers in switches that do have the two wire configuration. Be sure to check the switches you intend to replace before purchasing this set. Make sure you have two wires coming in to the box and not one! The dimmers themselves are very nice and work manually by sliding your finger up and down the switch to dim/brighten your lights. Very easy to use manually or with the app. Of course the real benefit is connecting these to Alexa and voice controlling your dimmers. This was easy to do and to rename the switches to what you would like. This is a terrific set of dimmers and I highly recommend, just wished I had checked my existing switches before ordering these.",

        "text": "I installed three of these side-by-side to replace a single dimmer switch that was on the fritz and two regular switches. One thing I was not prepared for (although it makes perfect sense now) is that unlike a regular witch, you MUST have the neutral, hot-in, and hot-out connected (a normal switch is just hot in and hot out). This wasn't a huge deal, but it did require extra labor to unbundle the neutral wires in the conduit box (and replace the conduit box entirely, but that isn't the fault of this product). The app works well enough, and the Alexa integration is very nice - especially when building routines (I now have a good morning route that will turn the kitchen light on to minimum brightness so I can get my day started at 4am). My two complaints against this product are both fairly minor. The first is a minor annoyance, not really a big deal: there is a delay before turning on or off the light when pressing the physical button. The second issue I have is the physical dimmer feature. I still don't know if you're meant to tap where you want the dimmer to be set (i.e., just tap the top portion of the lights) or if you're meant to slide your finger, but regardless which way I try, sometimes it registers my touch, other times it doesn't. And other times it'll just make it max brightness regardless where I tap. All in all, at about $17 per switch at the time of writing, it is really hard to beat the value. If you can rely on the app/Alexa integration for setting the dim or be patient with the physical dimmer, it's really not that bad. Again: For the price, they're fully functional, look nice, and work well enough.",
