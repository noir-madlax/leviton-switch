I'd ordered the TAPO TP/Link no-neutral switches first because they were less expensive, but they won't work in this situation. Even though my M3 Hub is downstairs, the switch connected quickly and easily. Yes, this switch is more expensive than others, but if you already have an Aqara ecosystem, this is the way to go for smart wall switches. Next time, I might try a matter-enabled switch.

Aqara makes some fantastic products, and I have bought several over the last few months, but I was very disappointed in this one. This switch did not include the small screws needed to attach the cover plate. I reached out to Aqara support and found they have no process for missing parts / defective products other than returning them to Amazon. I didn’t discover the missing screws until I had the switch installed. As such, I’m not going to pull it out of the wall for a replacement. I’ll just make a trip to the hardware store.

This does not use a neutral wire which was necessary for me as my house is older and does not have a neutral in the switch wiring box. Three wires to hook up. Line, load and ground. It is necessary to use an Aqara hub. I bought an E1 from Amazon as well, which was the least expensive option. Just follow the setup instructions in each box. The setup was a little clunky as I had to repeat steps a couple of times. You don’t have to turn off your 5G network, just make sure your phone is on a 2.5 during setup. All in all not a bad experience. The switch was packaged well and protected in the box. Very good build quality. I added Aqara Home skill to Alexa and now have voice control with my Echo dot. I’ve tried other less expensive smart switches that didn’t require neutral wires but couldn’t get any others to work with my fixture which has 4 bipin LED tubes. Highly recommended.",

        "text": "I had some old light switches that controlled my dining table light, and ceiling lights in the lounge that I wanted to incorporate into my smart home. Instead of adding unnecessary traffic on my WiFi network by adding a bunch of WiFi light bulbs, I added a paid of these to the light switches instead. These were easy to swap out, look amazing and operate flawlessly. The pros of doing it this way: * Much lower cost that replacing all the light bulbs with smart light bulbs * Doesn't add unnecessary load on a crowded WiFi network * Maintains the light switch functionality as before - toggles the lights on and off as normal * Avoids issues that might occur if you turned off a light switch with smart bulbs - you'd lose control over them. This problem doesn't exist in this case The cons: * Zigbee device and requires an Aqara Hub - I would recommend the M3, although anything from them will work. You can also use third party Zigbee hubs, and integrate into Home Assistant for example * No neutral comes with a price premium. Ouch!",

I had this switch with a light switch with a lamp with smart bulb. Controlling the smart bulb off meant no power to the aqara switch. The solution was to plug in a mesh network hub in the shared outlet. Any device that doesn't power off will work. Power is now completed in the circuit and the aqara won't lose power.",

        "text": "Some switches in my 1960s house have no neutral and no ground (switch loop wiring). This switch works perfectly fine and I was able to add this to Alexa directly and didn’t need the aqare hub or app. I hope this helps anyone that is in the same situation. I did ground mine to metal electrical boxes even though I didn’t have a ground. ---UPDATE--- After using these switches for a couple days, I've realized if you pair these directly to the Echo Zigbee hub, the switch eventually flashes red meaning it lost connection. This red light flashes until its controlled via Alexa voice again and then it eventually times out and will flash red again. To fix this I tried ordering the M2 Hub which fixed the red light issues but also created another issue. If these are connected to the Aqara hub, Alexa doesn't recognize the devices in routines to use them as triggers. They do appear if it is not being used as a trigger. Unfortunately in my case I am using my switches as triggers to turn on other switches/plugs of other brands. It seems like these devices are locked down to keep you in their ecosystem. If you don't mind them blinking red when on, they still work perfectly fine paired directly to the Echo hubs via Zigbee. UPDATE 3———- I was able to figure out how to get this to work correctly the way I wanted. Do not connect directly to Alexa skill, setup your hub and add all your devices and then add the hub into Alexa by the matter code. This always everything to work correctly in routines!! When I linked to Alexa skill and everything was imported 1 by 1 it was causing errors when trying to make certain routines.",

Here is how to get it done. Install the switch per instuctions. Simply wiring as it is shown. The switch should operate manually. I had red light flashing and wasted time trying to install via Aqara App and Alexa. Both run you thru the needing Aqara hub. Push and hold the switch until it turns on blue pairing mode. Now go to your Alexa Dot or other that supports Zigbee and tell it \"Alexa Discover Devices\". Alexa will find It and will pair up with it and give it a name like \"First Light Swith\". Test it in Alexa app and by voice. No where was this mentioned in all the stuff I looked at. I just knew that it had to be put into pairing mode so I held the switch till it happened. Hope this saves someone some time and cuts down on the returns to Aqara for people who are connecting this to Alexa eco-system.",

UPDATE: After rewiring to make sure the current has somewhere to go even when \"off\", and re-pairing a couple of times, it is now working well. UPDATE2: Worked for 16 months then suddenly bricked. Reset methods did not work. Some switches can fail and still work as a dumb physical switch, but not this one. (Single Rocker No Neutral)",

Having Zigbee is really nice but in the end, not worth the extra pairing I have to do every few weeks now with this switch in particular. Also, be aware that if you order the 'no neutral' model and plan to use it with LED lights, it is still sending energy to the fixture even when switched off and some LED fixtures will thus receive enough power to become energized and flicker.",

Since installing the light switches I've discovered that Aqaras non standard zigbee implementation will cause the light switches to disconnect every few weeks. It's not an issue that is isolated to a single switch, and the rest of my zigbee mesh works fine. The only way to reconnect the switch is to reset it. This issue means that it's a bigger headache than using manual switches and I wouldn't recommend these to HA users.",
