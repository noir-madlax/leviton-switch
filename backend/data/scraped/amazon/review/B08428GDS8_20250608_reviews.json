        "text": "I bought the Zigbee version if this dimmer switch because I have a large Zigbee network of devices. So far it's working well but it has one glaring omission compared to the same dimmer from the same company in the ZWave version. On the positive side this dimmer (and it's non-dimmer sibling) with the added remote switch(es) do a really good job of handling 3-way, 4-way etc. wiring configurations. Strangely there are few Zigbee options on the market that do well at this. I'm still buying these to handle that use case in my home and if you don't care about the missing automation feature then I highly recommend it. As an added bonus they come with a light almond paddle you can swap with the white which matches my decor. As to the negative side I don't know why the developers chose to do this but the Zigbee version of this switch only exposes on/off events and does not expose tap events like the ZWave version does. (Note: I do not have the ZWave version so I'm going off forum discussions that say the ZWave version exposes tap events). The lack of tap events means no automation events (scenes etc.) can be triggered on double tap etc. The switch firmware itself also does not go to 100% brightness on a double tap from a previously dimmed setting which many dimmer switches will do. This is what I had hoped to automate in my HA server with tap events but nope, can't do it. This could have been a 5 star product but I have to knock off a star for this omission in home automation support. I don't know if it's possible but I hope the developers add this in a future firmware update and would gladly revise my review if they did.",

This switch has 2 \"Line/Load\" terminals, 1 traveler, 1 neutral (which is required by the way), plus a ground. I haven't found a way to turn off the blue \"locator\" light, it should in theory be possible but I haven't found a way. It's only illuminated when the lighting is off, not an issue in my application but I can see that being less than ideal in a bedroom. Edit: You can change the locator light options from on (when switch is on or when it's off) to off by pressing up 3 times and down 1 time quickly and cycling through the options.",

Once I got them un-twisted and firmly seated in the neutral connector of the Enbrighten Zigbee Dimmer, connecting the two travelers and the ground to their sockets was easy. Connecting to my Home Assistant with a Sonoff Zigbee dongle was also easy. Then, a quick check of the dimmer manual to see how to set the blue indicator LED on the dimmer to my liking and I was done. Note that this switch doe not send a second \"off\" signal via zigbee if already off, nor a second \"on\" if already on, which prevents it from triggering double-tap automations.",

Not too deep, great back-connect screw-type connections (work fine with 12 gauge wire) with the ability to daisy chain, and even a rear-screw ground! But I bought it hoping that I could integrate it with my Philips Hue setup, and have the Hue Hub recognize it so I could use HUE multi-tap remotes to control the bathroom Vanity light that's on this circuit. No Can Do. Even though it's Zigbee 3.0, the Hue Hub just would not recognize it. I also tried using the Zigbee Hub in an EERO 6E with an Amazon Alexa smart hub, but the EERO couldn't seem to find it either. I could probably get something like a Hubitat to connect to it, but I just don't want to change over my whole system. I just want a wired wall switch that Philips Hue will recognize semi-natively so I can control the light over the vanity. I did not knock any stars off for not connecting to the Hue Hub, because they never promised it would. Otherwise, it's a great product. Net-Net: I ended up going with some Matter based TP-Link switches and connected them to the Alexa hub, and used the Amazon hub to connect a Hue remote through the Hue Hub to control the bathroom lights. A kludge, but it works.",

If you're looking for a switch to set the dimming/lights on/off it'll work well. Sadly, there's no way to read back the state of the switch. So if someone manually turns the light on/off/dims, you won't be notified that anything changes. As such, it's a write-only switch. I've since bought the Inoveli switch and would HIGHLY recommend that switch in terms of features and quality instead. It's more expensive, but it properly supports read & write, 3-way switches with dumb switches too and hosts a bunch of small configurable tweaks. At the time of writing, it's about $10 more on their website.",

        "text": "Edit Dec-2024: The switch failed after six months. Completely dead. Was 5 stars, now 2 stars. ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW ===================== I had success pairing the dimmer with my Tuya Zigbee hub and the Smart Life App. With power disabled, I installed the switch. Then I turned on the breaker to the lighting circuit and immediately started Smart Life's Zigbee device search. The switch was discovered within a few seconds. On/Off and dimming works fine through the App as well as locally. The Smart Life app correctly updates the reported on/off state when it is controlled locally at the wall switch. But local dimming does not update the dimmer brightness graphic in the app. This is not a deal killer for me, just a nuisance. My existing lighting circuit was controlled by two hallway light switches (typical \"3-way\" installation). So I also installed Enbrighten's optional Add-On Switch #46199, which provides a second location to control the light. Keep in mind that both devices require a neutral wire in the electrical junction boxes. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RQ8K25S",

They even come with a little neutral pigtail for adding to the wire nut that's almost certainly already in the box. Pairing to my Home Assistant was a breeze, and the controls work as expected. My only complaints are that it doesn't support anything beyond on, off, and dimming. There's no way to configure actions for double-tap, tap-and-hold, etc. (Tap-and-hold changes the brightness, but you can't change that.) They're not my favorites (I would rather use Inovelli switches instead) but they're great for blending in with existing paddle-style switches. So if you're looking for some simple smarts without all the bells and whistles, that looks like a normal switch, these are a good bet.",

        "text": "I installed this in a non traditional way. So your mileage may vary. But I have had no issues as of yet. Home assistant found it quickly. And after binding it to the LED controller that is also connected to home assistant. I now have the ability to dim/brighten, on/off. I do wish I had a way to change the color temperature. But I didnt want to spend $50-$60 per light switch. So I just added a wireless button to the setup that controls different scenes. But all in all. I am very happy with this purchase. Next will be to purchase one more and the add on for 3 way control. For the price. Its a great way to get into smart switches without spending a ton of money.",

Not nearly prominent enough considering that these switches have a standard 3-way switch design. They should put a plastic tab in the traveler lug that warns the user that a $22 add on switch is required. The third I installed is not compatible with my lights. They flash when dimmer is set between 5 and 25 percent. The part of the range that is best for mood lighting. Two stars because it is technically my own fault for not thoroughly reading the instructions. Ordered zooz zwave replacements.",

I also wish Enbrighten had a 'switch' model without the dimmer ability for a cheaper solution. I like that you get both paddle colors, thats a big + , another gripe is the confusion of 'addon' vs basic unit. When you search Amazon you get the Addons offered which do NOT work as a standalone.",

        "text": "My house has about 40 of these installed, I use 'home assistant' and these will also pair with Alexa 4gen. However the issue is durability, After a while, and this could be anywhere from 3 months to a year the ZigBee will fail and it will not pair up again. This requires me to have 'quick connect' in the box to replace them and spend 30 min to get the automation to work again. I have replaced about half of them over 2 years. I have several that have never given an issue, and others that need to be replaced in weeks/months. I used to run Zwave, and I do have several Zwave items on my network and they never fail. It seems the older Zigbee worked better when GE owned the company, but I am thinking the quality has gone down since ENbrighten has taken over. I would suggest that if you are going to use them, use quick connectors so replacing them is fairly quick. I would also look for cheaper switches, there are several out there that might work better for your specific need if you don't have a huge deployment as I have.",

Within a few days Alexa can no longer communicate with any of the switches. The physical dimmer switch also isn't great. My previous Wi-Fi dimmer switches have dedicated \"dim up\" or \"dim down\" buttons that you can click as many times as needed to reach the desired brightness. This switch requires you to hold the on button to brighten or hold the off button to dim. The problem is you get about 0.001 nanoseconds between the time you press down on the button and when you need to take you finger off. If you miss that window you end up at either maximum brightness or off.",

        "text": "Avoid these smart switches at all cost!! First and foremost Jasco Products / GE is the manufacturer of these switches then throws a handful of brand names on them. From my research these switches seemed like a great option for submitting Zigbee 3.0 to go along with my Home Assistant setup. The specifications described on both Amazon and Jasco’s site are inaccurate. The 600w rating is for your standard incandescent lights where as LEDs only having a rating of 300w. I installed 5 of these switches with the max circuit supporting a max of 6 recessed ceiling LEDs with a max wattage of 8w each. The lights would flicker aggressively on dimming, brightening, and just regular use at a dimmed percentage. This only happened on circuits containing 4 or more LEDs. I swapped the switches around, got replacement units, and reached out to Jasco support for firmware updates all with no success. I ended up switching back to some basic dimmer switches in the mean time with zero issues.",

        "text": "I really wanted these to work as they match other rocker switches, have a working dimmer function, and are supposed to connect to a smart hub for Alexa integration. The first one I order worked without the smart features, despite me have a neutral wire. I could manually turn on the switch, but the switch would not go into pair mode whether I reset it manually or disconnected the power to re-cycle it. I even got on the phone with tech support and they confirmed the switch was faulty as it would not enter pairing to make contact with the Enbrighten App or Alexa. I submitted a return and received an exchange two days later...and it's the exact same issue. The light switch will turn the lights on and off, dim them, but will not enter pairing mode when first connecting the switch to power so therefore is not discoverable by bluetooth, the Enbrighten App or Alexa. The led on the switch is supposed to blink indicating it's in pairing mode, and neither switch would start blinking, just three blinks every couple minutes. I wanted to like it, but I've apparently gotten two faulty switches in a row and I'm done with trying their products.",

Unfortunately, it causes some of the worst flickering (strobing, really) I've ever seen in popular LED fixtures. From the top of the range to ~50% or so, my lights just blink and strobe. I tested with a string of six Feit LEDR56/927CA retrofit lights, as well as a string of four in another room. The dimmer was horrible with both. When swapped for a known trustworthy dimmer (Lutron Diva), the lights dim smoothly and beautifully. Finally, I tested in a room with traditional halogen lighting. This dimmer still causes strobing and weird flickering during brightness changes. Disappointed, and sending it back.",
