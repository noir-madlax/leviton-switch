        "text": "This is my experience. How else can I rate a product except by personal experience? For many years, replacing a light switch was a no-brainer. Not in terms of being careless; one does not fool around with electricity (or plumbing). I mean in terms of going to the store and buying a Leviton light switch. Good quality and highly dependable. Well, I am sorry but I think something bad has happened in recent years at Leviton. In a nutshell, my experience is this: I have Leviton light switches that probably go back to when my house was new (circa 1980) and they go on and on, no problem. Never need replacing. However, with a handful of switches that did need replacing in recent years, I have needed to replace them more than once. Especially, in one case, a bathroom light switch. FOUR TIMES IN THE PAST TWO OR THREE YEARS. This is not a high-traffic area and there are no children playing with or abusing this switch. My wife and I are consciously taking it easy with this one, knowing that it keeps breaking. There is nothing in the way that it is installed that would account for it being fragile. Yet, here I was the other night, with my wife informing me that the bathroom light switch was broken again. This necessitated a trip to Home Depot which fortunately stays open until 10pm. And get this: A Home Depot employee approached me while I was looking for alternatives, offering me assistance. I asked him what in the heck is wrong with this type of Leviton light switch. \"It keeps breaking?\" he said. \"Yes,\" I said. He did not say anything else in response but he did nod his head in agreement, like it's not the first time he has heard this. My theory is, some time in the past few years, Leviton decided to go with a lower-grade of plastic in order to save money. What else would account for this repeated failure? And it's not just a bad batch; I have gone to both Ace Hardware and Home Depot over a long enough period of time with the same bad results for replacing Leviton light switches in the bathroom and two other locations in my house. Unasked, the Home Depot guy recommended that I go with a rocker type of switch instead. \"Better quality,\" was his advice. I hope so because it, too, is made by Leviton. For one thing is true: Leviton sure as heck has the local retail market sewn up. We may see alternatives here on Amazon but in places like Home Depot, Leviton is all that is available.",

What does necessitate me purchasing in bulk is that ants get into the work boxes and cause the switches to short circuit. I put medicated cattle ear tags in the industrial type boxes where the problem occurs, but the solution eventually evaporates, and the tags lose their effectiveness. When the switch fails to turn a light on or off, I already know the cause of the problem and go for one of these replacements and my tools. I'm old school. I still like the screw terminals rather than the plug and play. Highly recommended.",

        "text": "I have been using Leviton products since the mid 1990s. The box I received today has a positive feel (click) switching on, but more slike a sliding dimmer switch turning off. If they didn't arrive in a sealed box, then I would think that it was worn out. My house was built in 1976 and several of the switches that appeared to be original to the house had this amount of wear. The previous owner's didn't take very good care of the house and whoever wired it took short cuts. I recently purchased Leviton hospital grade recepticles and commercial grade switches and they are outstanding. The switches I received today are defective and will not be installed. Now a rant. There are nine recpticles on one circuit down stairs. I haven't checked if they used 14-2 Romex or 12-2. That sounds like too many to me the wall is drywall on one side, but open on the other. They have 14-2 Romex out of the breaker panel hooked up to more 14-2 going into 1/2\" EMT to a recepticle then back up and over to another EMT to another recepticle back up and then upstairs to a switched recepticle to power the garbage disposal then back down to the basement to power a third recepticle. Both instances sound wrong to me. The plumbing is worse. The three stooges did better. Two of the three toilets won't flush. The one that does flows counter-clock wise. The other two flow clock wise.",
