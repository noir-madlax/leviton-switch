I first purchased a Leviton 3-way dimmer switch from Home Depot with a rated capacity of 300W. That unit caused my lights to flicker. Then I purchased this Lutron Dimmer with a capacity of 250W hoping that the dimming feature would work better. The installation was easy but the lights continue to flicker, not continually, but occasionally. Other rooms that have dimmers but a fewer number of LED tubes and lower load do not flicker...so I must assume the cause is the dimmer unit. I would not recommend purchasing this unit.",

        "text": "I installed 12 Aspect LED ultra-thin in my basement several years back when finishing it into a home office. I purchased an 'approved' dimmer from Aspect LED at the time and have spent years annoyed with the horrible screeching whine that it made every time it was dimmed. In late 2019 I finally decided to do something about it. I tried ordering a new dimmer of the same type but it was defective and wouldn't dim. I tried a different brand and its hum was half as loud, but present even when at full intensity. I tried another one and it hummed louder than the first. After five failed attempts with five different switch models I was getting extremely frustrated, and decided to give it one more attempt; this time with a more expensive dimmer. This Lutron was 2x the price of my others, but ended up being worth every penny. It does not whine when at full. It does not whine when dimmed. And I am enjoying finally having my sanity back. It would have been worth 10x that price just to have the whine gone. So for that, I wanted to give this 5 stars. However, I have to take a star away for the fact that flipping the switch to on does not turn on my lights. Sometimes after a second or two they will begin to softly pulse (about once per second). However, to get the lights actually on I need to turn the dimmer to low, flip the switch on, and then turn the dimmer to full. I'm relatively sure the switch is wired correctly; even sent a photo to an electrician for a quick verification. I tried reseating all the wires and reconnecting; nothing helped. I even switched it out for the old dimmer just to verify nothing broke during the install, but the old dimmer worked perfect (though with a whine). No other dimmer switch had this problem. In the end I decided that a little annoyance when I turn it on each day is worth not having a high pitched whine constantly eating away at my sanity for 12+ hours every work day and kept it.",

        "text": "I’m a big fan of these dimmers because they fit right into a normal switch spot. I used this dimmer to dim 6 LED drivers for outdoor eave lights. These lights have a separate driver that controls the light so I needed this specific switch and it turned out to work great. I was so happy with this dimmer that I ordered another one for my back patio lights and if I end up wanting to dim some of my lights indoors I will probably use the same dimmer. My only gripe was that I ordered an amazon warehouse deal and the switch they sent me had paint on it and did not work right out of the box. I returned that switch and ordered a brand new one which worked out great. Great dimmer with clear instructions on how to wire it up.",

        "text": "Perfect. Especially like the fine-tuning dimming adjustment. I replaced 14 BR30 incandescent 65w bulbs in my great room and was using a 1000w Lutron dimmer for them. With the lower power demand of the LEDs, them would not dim low enough (too much power being sent through even at lowest setting). This dimmer is perfect and was able to adjust the fine-tuning dimmer so that the external dimmer slide would make the lights very dim. Highly recommend!",
