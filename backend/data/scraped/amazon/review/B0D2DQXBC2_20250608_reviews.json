        "text": "I have about 150 Leviton Z-Wave devices in my home that have been functioning for over 3 years. I have Leviton Z-Wave 15-amp outlets, 15-amp switches, 3-way dimmers, companion switches, fan speed controllers, plug-in dimmers and plug-in outlets. I haven't had a single failure - this includes 18 switches/dimmers/plug-in dimmers/plug-in outlets that are exposed to extreme temperatures in garages or an attic and 2 that are outside under an eve. Once I figured out the Z-Wave network (this was NOT an issue with the Leviton equipment), I ended up meshing 4 Hubitat Elevation hubs. Since then, the Leviton equipment has been virtually flawless. Every now and then (very, very rarely) it is necessary to reset a dimmer switch by air-gapping the power via lifting the dimming rocker (see photo). This takes about 3 seconds and everything is back to normal. *Note: In the photo, you will notice that the fan speed controller switches have a slightly brighter indicator light. Most find this useful for differentiation. However, it does detract from the uniformity. In my experience, I would consider Leviton + Z-Wave + Hubitat = commercial grade reliability. Truely set it and forget it.",

        "text": "I have installed eight ZW6HD dimmers, and every single one has reliability issues. Most of them give me grief daily, and they're only sometimes resolved by cutting power with the air-gap lever. I chose these because, for some reason, they're the *only* recent Z-Wave dimmer on the market that has dedicated dimming buttons. Numerous family members and guests were confused by my old switches and often dimmed them to 0% instead of turning them off. These were the only ones I could find that resolved that by reserving the primary paddle only for on/off control, which is what they were familiar with. Unfortunately, their reliability has left much to be desired. Here are some of the issues I've had with these dimmers: - Unresponsive to both paddle presses or Z-Wave commands until the power was reset. - Fails to turn on via Z-Wave command but the dimmer reports via Z-Wave that it did turn on. Upon requesting an updated status, the wrong status was reported again. - Fails to turn off but the dimmer reports via Z-Wave that it did turn off. Likewise, an update request returned the same incorrect status. - The dimmers not remembering their last brightness (i.e., turning on to full brightness when the were turned off while at 20%). - The dimmers failing to report an updated status when turned on or off with the paddle. To top it all off, Leviton support has been unresponsive to my requests. Unless and until Leviton can fix the hardware and/or firmware issues with these dimmers, I can't recommend them.",

        "text": "The good: - Pairing was easy with z-wave smart start - z-wave responded reliably and quickly The neutral: - I didn't think it's any bigger than other dimmers, fit in a really old box just fine - Pigtails - in my case, it actually worked out better since someone before me had cut the wires in the box very short The bad: - Hardware quality is very poor. I thought buying from an established electrical device company like Leviton would at least have benefits in that regard, but not so. The switch feels extremely cheap. There is a lot of slop in the mechanism and the materials just feel cheap plastic and seem like they would break easily. Pushing the paddles only seems to work every other time or so, or you have to push really hard. - Buggy. Every time you turn it off via z-wave, and then turn back on at the switch, it comes on at the very lowest dim level, regardless of the settings configured for this. It also does this randomly sometimes when turning off from the switch itself. - Green LEDs are configurable, but can't change the color. Would be much better if that could be adjusted to match other devices in the same box.",

        "text": "Update 4 months later: What we thought was an isolated issue regarding Amazon’s inventory of these dimmers turned out to be an issue with all Leviton dimmers - even those purchased directly from Leviton. The dimmers OFF button is unresponsive every 1 out of 20 times, which is actually pretty frustrating. Some of the dimmers had a worse ratio of 1 out of every 4 button presses does nothing. Furthermore we noticed an interesting quality issue with the dimmer when used with a fan/light combo (fan connected to always hot, light connected to the dimmer). The lights on the fan flash when the fan pull chain is pulled, telling me a power spike or draw is getting back into the dimmer. We did not have this issue when we wired up a Lutron dimmer in the same configuration. Sadly we returned the Leviton dimmers and went back to Lutron Caseta. I hated to give up the Vivint Z-Wave integration but reliability is more important. Now that we are back with Lutron, wow! I forgot how smooth and refined their stuff was. I guess you get what you pay for. Update 3 months later: I still highly recommend this switch but don’t recommend purchasing them from Amazon. After ordering a couple directly from Leviton we’ve seen a noticeable quality difference. The switches ordered from Amazon tend to be finicky about where you press the On/Off paddle, leading to 1 out of 20 times the switch doesn’t respond. The Amazon purchased switches have plastic inside packaging vs cardboard on Leviton, telling me there definitely is a difference in the products (same model but maybe a different batch or version). The LED status light is also not as bright on the Amazon switches either. They cost $10 more from Leviton, but I highly recommend purchasing directly from the manufacturer. Original review: These Leviton Z-Wave Dimmers perform well and are one of the best Z-Wave options out there, especially if you want to integrate into a Vivint alarm system. We previously had Lutron Sunnata dimmers which we loved, but they didn’t integrate with our alarm panel so we decided to switch. The build quality is on par with the price (not as good as Lutron but better than Enbrighten/GE). Adding them to our Z-Wave compatible alarm panel was easy via the instructions and YES you can change Z-Wave parameters per dimmer (we turned off the green dimmer status indicator, changed ramp ON time to 1s, and set default value to full brightness vs last used level). Respond time is quick for the dimmer and installation in the electrical box is pretty easy. Some users complain about the new wire pigtails (vs terminal screws); coming from Lutron we were used to this so no complaints from me and the dimmer fits in “most” existing electrical boxes. We upgraded some 2- and 3-gang boxes to deep versions. Overall we are pleased with the Leviton dimmer (and switch) and would recommend it to anyone looking for a Z-Wave compatible dimmer.",

        "text": "I've had no issues with the older Leviton DZ6HD z-wave dimmer switches, but these are no longer available. Their replacement model, the ZW6HD-1RW (though more expensive than other z-wave dimmers), has a separate light level adjustment rocker, like the DZ6HD, which is why I purchased it. I installed two ZW6HD-1RWs. Both of them showed the same functional failure: if you turn the light off via the controller and then turn it on via the physical switch, the switch's previous light level setting gets reset to 1% (and, depending on the type of light, it can look like it's off). You then have to increase the illumination either through the physical switch or the controller, to return it to the setting you previously had. This made the switch unusable for me. For reference, the Leviton ZW6HD-1RW firmware versions were 1.1.0 and at factor default settings. I'm running the lasted version of Home Assistant and it's libraries, and my z-wave controller is a Nortek HUSBZB-1. I was able to contact Leviton support, but they were unable to identify or resolve the problem. I ended up returning the Leviton switches and purchasing some UltraPro z-wave dimmer switches, at a significantly lower cost, that performed perfectly.",

        "text": "Got this to replace a GE/Jasco dimmer smart switch. Connected fine to SmartThings after following the instructions. Definitely more lag than the GE’s to a point where I’m unsure if it’s working. Then a few seconds later it works. The GE smart switch that was in the same location worked with no lag. Also another bothersome thing is the dimmer function. When adjusting from the switch and then manually turning it off and on it works. But then when I turn it off and on using SmartThings, the dimmer setting changes Sometimes it’s 1% other times some random level. Moreover sometimes when manually turning on the switch, SmartThings shows it as off. How am I supposed to reliably know the on/off status unless I physically go to the location and check the light! Worthless if I’m remote. Luckily it’s not in a high-use location and since it’s already wired in and installed I’m not about to disconnect the wires for return and to set up and reinstall another model. I do not recommend this unless you’re okay with the dimmer control and on/off status issue or have found a solution for it. It’s definitely a 1 star rating for me.",

        "text": "We had half a house full of the 600 series Leviton devices, which worked well enough. The have the interchangeable face plates so we can match the gray plates our builder used. The 600 series had a problem with Homeseer hubs that the devices would stop sending live events (e.g. if someone presses the switch, it sends an event to the hub that the switch was pressed). These devices appear to finally fix that issue, and so far have been sending events successfully. They also work with the existing generation of dimmer remote companions, which were common across a lot of Leviton products. This was a nice consistency to maintain. Most importantly, from outware appearances they look and function just like their predecessors. Green LED when powered off, green LED to show dimming action, and amber LED when in inclusion mode. From the casual user, there is no difference, and no risk in mix and matching old and new devices. I'm grateful Leviton didn't go to a white or blue LED, for example. Most frustratingly, while other manufacturers are slimming down the fixture depth, Leviton went backwards and are using an old-school encloses device, with pre-wired, braided copper pigtails. Which means on a dimmer, you have five wire nuts and leads to make fit in your box. It gets tight, but fortunately I only needed these on boxes that are pretty empty. It might get busy with multiple dimmers/switches involved. This is the only reason I took a star away.",
