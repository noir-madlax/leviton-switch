    "prompt": "You are an aspect categorization specialist.\n\n**YOUR TASK:** Categorize physical aspects into the most appropriate categories from the provided taxonomy.\n\n**UNDERSTANDING THE DATA:**\n- Each aspect represents customer feedback about different physical product characteristics and attributes\n- Categorize each aspect into the most appropriate category\n- Use \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\" for aspects that don't fit well into any category\n- Focus on business value and customer impact when making assignments\n\n**AVAILABLE CATEGORIES:**\n**AVAILABLE CATEGORIES:**\n[C_0] Button Interface: Physical button controls, layouts, and activation methods including touch-activated interfaces, e.g. button layout changes, on/off buttons, scene selection buttons, touch-activated interfaces\n[C_1] Slider Controls: Physical sliding mechanisms for dimming and control adjustment, e.g. smooth responsive sliders, stiff slider movement, slide bar operation\n[C_2] Visual Indicators: LED lights, status indicators, and visual feedback elements on the device, e.g. blue LED indicator lights, green status lights, brightness of indicator symbols\n[C_3] Physical Mounting: Installation hardware and mounting mechanisms including wall mounts and magnetic attachments, e.g. wall mount with screw or adhesive options, magnetic mounting strength, stick-on plates\n[C_4] Electrical Connections: Wire connections, terminals, and electrical interface components, e.g. load wire marking, ground terminals, hot wire connections, push-in connections, wire routing difficulties\n[C_5] Cover Components: Removable covers, face plates, and protective housing elements, e.g. cover plates that snap on, face plates breaking off, screw-secured covers, included wall plates\n[C_6] Physical Dimensions: Size, depth, and spatial fit characteristics within electrical installations, e.g. optimal depth for wall box, compact form factor, fitting in electrical boxes\n[C_7] Material Construction: Build materials, structural integrity, and manufacturing quality, e.g. polycarbonate construction, plastic quality, sturdy vs flimsy materials, solid construction\n[C_8] Aesthetic Design: Visual appearance, color, and styling characteristics, e.g. modern sleek look, color matching issues, slim profile, clean design\n[C_9] Mechanical Operation: Physical switch mechanisms, tactile feedback, and operational feel, e.g. rocker switch clicks, smooth quiet operation, squeaking sounds, satisfying click feedback\n[C_10] Internal Mechanisms: Internal moving parts and adjustment components, e.g. rocker pivots breaking, toggle switches falling apart, thumbwheel dials, internal adjustment wheels\n[C_11] Power Management: Battery life and power-related physical characteristics, e.g. battery lasting upwards of a year, power capacity specifications\n[C_12] Magnetic Systems: Magnetic attachment and holding mechanisms, e.g. magnets holding remote to mount, magnetic strength between versions\n[C_13] OUT_OF_SCOPE: Aspects that are too vague, generic, or unclear to categorize meaningfully\n\n\n**CATEGORIZATION GUIDELINES:**\n1. **Business Focus**: Think about what categories would be most valuable for business teams\n2. **Customer Impact**: Consider how these aspects affect customer experience and satisfaction\n3. **Strategic Value**: Choose categories that help prioritize product improvements and business decisions\n4. **Clear Boundaries**: Each aspect should fit clearly into one category with no ambiguity\n5. **OUT_OF_SCOPE Usage**: Use only for aspects that are truly unclear, too generic, or don't fit any meaningful category\n\n**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**\nReturn pure JSON mapping each aspect ID to its category ID:\n{\n  \"1\": \"C_0\",\n  \"2\": \"C_1\", \n  \"3\": \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\",\n  \"4\": \"C_2\",\n  ...\n}\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n- **Complete Coverage**: Every aspect ID from the input must appear exactly once in the output\n- **Valid Category IDs**: Use only the category IDs provided (C_0, C_1, etc.) or \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\"\n- **Pure JSON**: Return only the JSON object - no explanations or formatting\n- **No Duplicates**: Each aspect ID should appear exactly once\n- **Strategic Thinking**: Consider business and customer value when making assignments\n\n\n\n**PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN DATASET:** Dimmer Switches, Light Switches\nConsider how physical aspects relate to customer needs across these 2 product categories.\n\n**INPUT:**\n[0] buttons: button layout changed between v1 and v2 versions\n[1] buttons: top button for on/off\n[2] buttons: bottom button changed from off to hue function\n[3] buttons: one button for on/off\n[4] buttons: center rocker for dimming\n[5] buttons: button for scene selection\n[6] magnets: magnets hold remote to mount with perfect strength\n[7] magnets: magnet holding to housing not as good as v1\n[8] design: slim profile\n[9] design: new design looks awesome\n[10] design: design puts features before usability\n[11] design: shape not compatible between versions\n[12] wall_mount: wall mount with screw option or 3M adhesive\n[13] wall_mount: stick on plate for convenient install\n[14] battery: battery lasts very long time upwards of a year\n[15] build_quality: seems well-made\n[16] appearance: modern and sleek design\n[17] appearance: clean design\n[18] build_quality: well made and sturdy construction\n[19] build_quality: not flimsy\n[20] build_quality: good quality material\n[21] build_quality: high end appearance\n[22] slider: smooth and responsive slider\n[23] slider: easy to move slide bar\n[24] slider: stiff slider movement\n[25] buttons: big buttons\n[26] wiring: load wires same color without proper marking\n[27] cover_plate: cover plate difficult to snap on\n[28] cover_plate: enclosed cover wouldn't stay on\n[29] cover_plate: screw-secured cover\n[30] screw_design: hidden screws\n[31] size: optimal depth for wall box\n[32] size: fits existing box easily\n[33] Material: Made of cheap plastic\n[34] Material: Made of polycarbonate that cracks\n[35] Color: Off-white color instead of white\n[36] Color: Gloss ivory color instead of gloss white\n[37] Design: Lightweight\n[38] Design: Compact size that doesn't take much space in electrical box\n[39] Design: Has holes on the back for hookup\n[40] Design: Has satisfying click\n[41] Design: Has gaps at the top of the switch\n[42] Ground Terminal: Ground terminal is hard to work with\n[43] Paddle/Switch Cover: Tab on switch cover breaks off\n[44] size: compact and small form factor\n[45] button: touch-activated button interface\n[46] button: blue LED indicator light on button\n[47] wiring: 4-wire configuration\n[48] wiring: stiff and hard to route wires\n[49] wiring: heat shrink wrapper that is bulky\n[50] wiring: disconnected wire upon arrival\n[51] construction: appears nicely made\n[52] construction: packaged properly\n[53] specifications: 12V max 36 watt capacity\n[54] specifications: cannot handle 2 amps or higher current\n[55] Design: Single gang design for dual functions\n[56] Design: Modern appearance\n[57] Design: Deeper than regular switch\n[58] Design: No cover included\n[59] Design: Small LED indicators for each control\n[60] Wiring: Hot wire connection difficulty\n[61] Wiring: Requires specific electrical wiring\n[62] Wiring: Supplied wire nuts and screws\n[63] Components: Rocker switches for on/off\n[64] Components: Side controls for fan speed and dimmer\n[65] Components: Pull tab cutoff at bottom\n[66] construction: solidly made and not flimsy\n[67] connections: both screws and push-in connections on the back\n[68] compatibility: use standard screws and decora plates\n[69] tactile_feedback: good \"click\" as they switch\n[70] Construction Quality: Poor build quality with gaps developing\n[71] Construction Quality: Feels very low quality\n[72] Construction Quality: High quality feel\n[73] Construction Quality: Feels solid\n[74] Construction Quality: Cheaply made\n[75] Construction Quality: Physically coming apart\n[76] Switch Design: Nice looking switch\n[77] Switch Design: Neat look\n[78] Switch Design: Nice simple design\n[79] Switch Design: Perfect size and matches white color\n[80] Switch Design: Looks off to the rear of the switches\n[81] Wiring: Has red and one black wire that does not conform to residential wiring\n[82] Internal Components: Pivot of the rocker broke on one side\n[83] Internal Components: Toggle switch fell apart when tried to use\n[84] Internal Components: Has thumbwheel dial under cover for adjustment\n[85] Internal Components: Has wheel adjustment on inside to help adjust lowest dimmer setting\n[86] Size: Switch base is really big making connections difficult to fit in electrical box\n[87] Appearance: Simple, modern sleek look\n[88] Appearance: Look nice\n[89] Appearance: Well made complete set with cover plates and wire nuts\n[90] Appearance: Beautiful instrument and well manufactured\n[91] Face plate: Face plate has broken off from the switch\n[92] Touch interface: Touch plate for dimming seems awkward -
