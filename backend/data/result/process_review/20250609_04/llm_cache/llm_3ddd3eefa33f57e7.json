    "prompt": "You are a review aspect categorization specialist.\n\nYou are tasked with categorizing performance aspects extracted from customer reviews into meaningful subcategories.\n\n**PRODUCT CONTEXT:**\nThese aspects come from various product categories and should be categorized considering the business context and customer needs across different product types.\n\n**INPUT FORMAT:**\nLines showing performance aspects in format: [ID] category: detail\n\n**UNDERSTANDING THE DATA:**\n- Each aspect represents customer feedback about different product functionality and operational characteristics\n- The goal is to create NEW, business-focused categories that group similar customer concerns\n- Approach this with fresh thinking - don't be constrained by any existing groupings\n- Consider: What categories would help prioritize product improvements?\n- Think about customer journey impact rather than technical specifications\n- Create categories that marketing, product, and operations teams would find actionable\n\n**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**\nReturn **pure JSON only** (no explanations, no markdown, no code blocks):\n{\n  \"Meaningful Subcategory 1\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Clear description of what this subcategory represents, e.g. specific examples\"\n  },\n  \"Meaningful Subcategory 2\": {\n    \"definition\": \"...\"\n  },\n  \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Aspects that are unclear, too generic, or don't fit into meaningful performance categories\",\n    \"ids\": [...]\n  }\n}\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n\n**Data Integrity & Completeness:**\n1. **OUT_OF_SCOPE IDs**: Only include \"ids\" field for OUT_OF_SCOPE category with aspects that don't fit any meaningful category\n2. **Category Definitions Only**: Regular categories only need clear definitions - no \"ids\" field required\n\n**Output Format:**\n3. **Format**: Pure JSON object only - no surrounding text or formatting\n4. **Definitions**: Each category must have a \"definition\" field describing what the subcategory represents, ending with \"e.g.\" and specific examples\n5. **No IDs for Regular Categories**: Regular categories should only have definitions - do not include \"ids\" field\n\n**Categorization Logic:**\n6. **Categories & Mutual Exclusivity**: Create meaningful subcategories (words separated by spaces) for legitimate performance aspects; each subcategory must represent a SINGULAR, SPECIFIC concept with NO OVERLAP between categories - each aspect can only belong to ONE subcategory with clear boundaries\n7. **OUT_OF_SCOPE Usage**: Use this special category for aspects that are too vague, generic, or unclear to categorize meaningfully - use \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\" as the last resort for truly uncategorizable items\n8. **Categorization Basis**: Group similar performance aspects by their core meaning and customer impact, considering both positive and negative sentiment patterns\n\n**Category Quality:**\n9. **Consistent Granularity**: All subcategories must be at the same level of specificity - avoid mixing broad categories with narrow ones\n10. **Precise Terminology**: Use precise, specific terms that reflect the nature of customer concerns - avoid generic words like \"specialty\", \"miscellaneous\", \"other\"\n11. **Category Atomicity**: Avoid conjunctions and compound categories - create separate distinct categories instead\n12. **Customer-Centric Focus**: Categories should reflect meaningful customer experience dimensions rather than technical product features\n13. **Sentiment Awareness**: Consider both positive and negative feedback patterns when grouping aspects, as they often reveal the same underlying customer concern\n\n**PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN DATASET:** Dimmer Switches, Light Switches\nConsider how performance aspects relate to customer needs across these 2 product categories.\n\n**INPUT:**\n[150] Electrical Safety: Switch exploded\n[151] Electrical Safety: Switch causes internal arcing\n[152] Functionality: No longer switches\n[153] Functionality: On off switch does not work\n[154] Functionality: Did not work when installed\n[155] Functionality: Works perfectly\n[156] Functionality: Works smoothly and as intended\n[157] Functionality: Works as intended\n[158] Dimming capability: Not 1-100 percent dimming as advertised - LED light still insanely bright at lowest setting\n[159] Dimming capability: Dimmest setting not particularly dim - still quite bright\n[160] Dimming capability: Don't dim lights far enough down\n[161] Dimming capability: Allows dimming to 6% which is excellent\n[162] Dimming capability: Very adjustable - can turn brightness up or down by as little as 1%\n[163] Dimming capability: Will not dim by voice command - only manually\n[164] Dimming capability: Dimmer wouldn't dim with existing non-dimmable lightbulbs\n[165] Reliability: Stopped functioning after 1 month\n[166] Reliability: 3 out of 4 will not re-pair in less than a year\n[167] Reliability: One switch stops working after couple of days\n[168] Reliability: Dies within months - had 3 die in a year\n[169] Reliability: Failed in less than 6 months\n[170] Reliability: Keep failing - switches stop working\n[171] Reliability: Several failed within 6 months, 50% gone in 20 months\n[172] Reliability: Two of four switches failed in less than a year\n[173] Overheating: Keeps turning off after 15 min when dimmed 100% due to overheating\n[174] Connectivity: Easy to connect to Alexa\n[175] Connectivity: Works well with Google\n[176] Connectivity: None would program to work remotely\n[177] Connectivity: No longer works with Alexa as of 2023\n[178] Connectivity: Lost Wi-Fi connection\n[179] Connectivity: Had trouble registering to simultaneous dual band wifi until using dedicated 2.4GHz band\n[180] Response time: Delay before turning on or off when pressing physical button\n[181] Timer function: Timer doesn't allow dimming\n[182] Switch function: Switch function is super easygoing\n[183] Switch function: Works great\n[184] Switch function: Functions well\n[185] functionality: stopped working after a year\n[186] functionality: defective unit\n[187] functionality: works as expected\n[188] functionality: works fine\n[189] functionality: just works\n[190] functionality: two switches didn't work and caused power outage\n[191] durability: so far so good\n[192] durability: works great so far\n[193] value: worth the money\n[194] value: worth the price\n[195] value: great value\n[196] value: good value for money\n[197] value: good value",
