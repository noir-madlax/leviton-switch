    "prompt": "You are a review aspect categorization specialist.\n\nYou are tasked with categorizing performance aspects extracted from customer reviews into meaningful subcategories.\n\n**PRODUCT CONTEXT:**\nThese aspects come from various product categories and should be categorized considering the business context and customer needs across different product types.\n\n**INPUT FORMAT:**\nLines showing performance aspects in format: [ID] category: detail\n\n**UNDERSTANDING THE DATA:**\n- Each aspect represents customer feedback about different product functionality and operational characteristics\n- The goal is to create NEW, business-focused categories that group similar customer concerns\n- Approach this with fresh thinking - don't be constrained by any existing groupings\n- Consider: What categories would help prioritize product improvements?\n- Think about customer journey impact rather than technical specifications\n- Create categories that marketing, product, and operations teams would find actionable\n\n**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**\nReturn **pure JSON only** (no explanations, no markdown, no code blocks):\n{\n  \"Meaningful Subcategory 1\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Clear description of what this subcategory represents, e.g. specific examples\"\n  },\n  \"Meaningful Subcategory 2\": {\n    \"definition\": \"...\"\n  },\n  \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Aspects that are unclear, too generic, or don't fit into meaningful performance categories\",\n    \"ids\": [...]\n  }\n}\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n\n**Data Integrity & Completeness:**\n1. **OUT_OF_SCOPE IDs**: Only include \"ids\" field for OUT_OF_SCOPE category with aspects that don't fit any meaningful category\n2. **Category Definitions Only**: Regular categories only need clear definitions - no \"ids\" field required\n\n**Output Format:**\n3. **Format**: Pure JSON object only - no surrounding text or formatting\n4. **Definitions**: Each category must have a \"definition\" field describing what the subcategory represents, ending with \"e.g.\" and specific examples\n5. **No IDs for Regular Categories**: Regular categories should only have definitions - do not include \"ids\" field\n\n**Categorization Logic:**\n6. **Categories & Mutual Exclusivity**: Create meaningful subcategories (words separated by spaces) for legitimate performance aspects; each subcategory must represent a SINGULAR, SPECIFIC concept with NO OVERLAP between categories - each aspect can only belong to ONE subcategory with clear boundaries\n7. **OUT_OF_SCOPE Usage**: Use this special category for aspects that are too vague, generic, or unclear to categorize meaningfully - use \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\" as the last resort for truly uncategorizable items\n8. **Categorization Basis**: Group similar performance aspects by their core meaning and customer impact, considering both positive and negative sentiment patterns\n\n**Category Quality:**\n9. **Consistent Granularity**: All subcategories must be at the same level of specificity - avoid mixing broad categories with narrow ones\n10. **Precise Terminology**: Use precise, specific terms that reflect the nature of customer concerns - avoid generic words like \"specialty\", \"miscellaneous\", \"other\"\n11. **Category Atomicity**: Avoid conjunctions and compound categories - create separate distinct categories instead\n12. **Customer-Centric Focus**: Categories should reflect meaningful customer experience dimensions rather than technical product features\n13. **Sentiment Awareness**: Consider both positive and negative feedback patterns when grouping aspects, as they often reveal the same underlying customer concern\n\n**PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN DATASET:** Dimmer Switches, Light Switches\nConsider how performance aspects relate to customer needs across these 2 product categories.\n\n**INPUT:**\n[2265] compatibility: works with single-pole or 3-way configuration\n[2266] compatibility: works when light fixture calls for 0-10v dimmer\n[2267] compatibility: works great with 0-10V lights\n[2268] compatibility: works perfectly with on/off switch built in\n[2269] compatibility: works exactly like it should\n[2270] compatibility: mostly works with Metalux 2x2' troffer lights\n[2271] compatibility: works well with three 8 foot LED lights\n[2272] compatibility: didn't work with installed lights\n[2273] compatibility: couldn't get to work despite electrical experience\n[2274] functionality: do the job\n[2275] functionality: no issues with the product\n[2276] durability: super buenos (very good durability)\n[2277] durability: will last for years to come\n[2278] heat_dissipation: handles 900w well in terms of dissipating heat\n[2279] heat_dissipation: heat up with high wattage loads\n[2280] heat_dissipation: overheating with lesser wattage dimmer\n[2281] heat_dissipation: no longer have overheating problem\n[2282] heat_dissipation: very little heat problem\n[2283] functionality: could not handle 480 watts despite 600w rating\n[2284] functionality: dimmer feature burned out in 9 months\n[2285] functionality: could only be used as off or on switch\n[2286] functionality: did not work out of the box\n[2287] functionality: does the job as expected\n[2288] installation: change out was quick and easy\n[2289] pricing: reasonably priced\n[2290] pricing: 1000w was pricey compared to 600w\n[2291] operation: works perfectly\n[2292] operation: works great\n[2293] operation: works very well\n[2294] operation: working flawlessly\n[2295] operation: works fine as expected\n[2296] operation: would not work with any lamps\n[2297] operation: didn't work straight out of the box\n[2298] operation: stopped working after couple months\n[2299] operation: electrical short in both units\n[2300] dimming: easy tap operation for on/off\n[2301] dimming: touch control for dimming adjustment\n[2302] dimming: remembers last dimming state\n[2303] dimming: does not dim down very far\n[2304] dimming: could not change intensity high or low\n[2305] dimming: constantly flicker with LED bulbs\n[2306] dimming: only three settings with flickering\n[2307] convenience: very convenient\n[2308] convenience: easy to use\n[2309] convenience: super convenient for hard to reach lamps\n[2310] compatibility: restricts to single type bulb\n[2311] compatibility: does not work with LED bulbs\n[2312] durability: potential reliability concerns\n[2313] operation: works as expected\n[2314] operation: works like it should\n[2315] operation: working light switch\n[2316] operation: turn lights on and off properly\n[2317] operation: one did not work\n[2318] operation: worked perfectly\n[2319] operation: fit and worked fine\n[2320] operation: work as they should\n[2321] operation: work very well\n[2322] operation: got lights working again\n[2323] noise: quiet operation\n[2324] noise: noiselessly\n[2325] durability: made sturdy to last\n[2326] durability: screw stripped with almost no pressure\n[2327] installation: simple enough to install\n[2328] installation: takes good push to get wire in\n[2329] installation: extra time to relocate ground wires\n[2330] Reliability: Device failure after nine months\n[2331] Reliability: Very durable with no failures after 2 years\n[2332] Reliability: Severe reliability issues with 800 series -
