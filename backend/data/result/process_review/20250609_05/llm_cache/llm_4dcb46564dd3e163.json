    "prompt": "You are a review aspect categorization specialist.\n\nYou are tasked with categorizing performance aspects extracted from customer reviews into meaningful subcategories.\n\n**PRODUCT CONTEXT:**\nThese aspects come from various product categories and should be categorized considering the business context and customer needs across different product types.\n\n**INPUT FORMAT:**\nLines showing performance aspects in format: [ID] category: detail\n\n**UNDERSTANDING THE DATA:**\n- Each aspect represents customer feedback about different product functionality and operational characteristics\n- The goal is to create NEW, business-focused categories that group similar customer concerns\n- Approach this with fresh thinking - don't be constrained by any existing groupings\n- Consider: What categories would help prioritize product improvements?\n- Think about customer journey impact rather than technical specifications\n- Create categories that marketing, product, and operations teams would find actionable\n\n**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**\nReturn **pure JSON only** (no explanations, no markdown, no code blocks):\n{\n  \"Meaningful Subcategory 1\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Clear description of what this subcategory represents, e.g. specific examples\"\n  },\n  \"Meaningful Subcategory 2\": {\n    \"definition\": \"...\"\n  },\n  \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\": {\n    \"definition\": \"Aspects that are unclear, too generic, or don't fit into meaningful performance categories\",\n    \"ids\": [...]\n  }\n}\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n\n**Data Integrity & Completeness:**\n1. **OUT_OF_SCOPE IDs**: Only include \"ids\" field for OUT_OF_SCOPE category with aspects that don't fit any meaningful category\n2. **Category Definitions Only**: Regular categories only need clear definitions - no \"ids\" field required\n\n**Output Format:**\n3. **Format**: Pure JSON object only - no surrounding text or formatting\n4. **Definitions**: Each category must have a \"definition\" field describing what the subcategory represents, ending with \"e.g.\" and specific examples\n5. **No IDs for Regular Categories**: Regular categories should only have definitions - do not include \"ids\" field\n\n**Categorization Logic:**\n6. **Categories & Mutual Exclusivity**: Create meaningful subcategories (words separated by spaces) for legitimate performance aspects; each subcategory must represent a SINGULAR, SPECIFIC concept with NO OVERLAP between categories - each aspect can only belong to ONE subcategory with clear boundaries\n7. **OUT_OF_SCOPE Usage**: Use this special category for aspects that are too vague, generic, or unclear to categorize meaningfully - use \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\" as the last resort for truly uncategorizable items\n8. **Categorization Basis**: Group similar performance aspects by their core meaning and customer impact, considering both positive and negative sentiment patterns\n\n**Category Quality:**\n9. **Consistent Granularity**: All subcategories must be at the same level of specificity - avoid mixing broad categories with narrow ones\n10. **Precise Terminology**: Use precise, specific terms that reflect the nature of customer concerns - avoid generic words like \"specialty\", \"miscellaneous\", \"other\"\n11. **Category Atomicity**: Avoid conjunctions and compound categories - create separate distinct categories instead\n12. **Customer-Centric Focus**: Categories should reflect meaningful customer experience dimensions rather than technical product features\n13. **Sentiment Awareness**: Consider both positive and negative feedback patterns when grouping aspects, as they often reveal the same underlying customer concern\n\n**PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN DATASET:** Dimmer Switches, Light Switches\nConsider how performance aspects relate to customer needs across these 2 product categories.\n\n**INPUT:**\n[2416] durability: constant on/off switching without failure\n[2417] durability: reduced risk of damage
