    "prompt": "You are an aspect categorization specialist.\n\n**YOUR TASK:** Categorize performance aspects into the most appropriate categories from the provided taxonomy.\n\n**UNDERSTANDING THE DATA:**\n- Each aspect represents customer feedback about different product functionality and operational characteristics\n- Categorize each aspect into the most appropriate category\n- Use \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\" for aspects that don't fit well into any category\n- Focus on business value and customer impact when making assignments\n\n**AVAILABLE CATEGORIES:**\n**AVAILABLE CATEGORIES:**\n[C_0] Smart Home Integration: Aspects related to connecting and working with smart home ecosystems, apps, and voice assistants, e.g. Philips Hue app connectivity, HomeKit pairing, Alexa integration, WiFi connection issues\n[C_1] Operational Reliability: Aspects concerning consistent day-to-day performance and dependability over time, e.g. always works when activated, requires multiple button presses, stops working after months, consistent performance\n[C_2] Dimming Performance: Aspects specifically about brightness control capabilities and quality, e.g. smooth dimming operation, precise brightness control, limited dimming range, flickering at low settings\n[C_3] Installation Experience: Aspects related to the setup and wiring process during initial installation, e.g. easy installation, confusing wiring diagrams, no neutral wire required, tough installation process\n[C_4] Physical Durability: Aspects concerning the physical robustness and longevity of hardware components, e.g. paddles cracking, tabs breaking off, switches breaking easily, well-built construction\n[C_5] Device Compatibility: Aspects about working effectively with different bulb types, electrical systems, and equipment, e.g. LED bulb compatibility, works with ceiling fans, voltage requirements, multi-way setups\n[C_6] User Interface Experience: Aspects related to ease of use, control methods, and interaction design, e.g. intuitive button controls, customizable scenes, difficult to aim in dark, user-friendly operation\n[C_7] Electrical Performance: Aspects concerning electrical safety, power handling, and circuit behavior, e.g. overheating issues, electrical arcing, power outages, proper load handling\n[C_8] Audio and Visual Feedback: Aspects about sounds, lights, and other sensory feedback from the device, e.g. buzzing noise, quiet operation, indicator lights, flickering issues\n[C_9] Response Timing: Aspects related to how quickly the device reacts to user inputs and commands, e.g. delay when pressing buttons, responsive activation, lag in voice commands\n[C_10] Aesthetic Integration: Aspects concerning visual appearance and how well the device fits with home decor, e.g. looks identical to brand-name switches, matches wall plates, visual appeal\n[C_11] Purchase Value: Aspects related to cost-effectiveness and overall value proposition, e.g. worth the money, good value for price, expensive for features offered\n[C_12] OUT_OF_SCOPE: Aspects that are too generic, vague, or don't provide specific actionable feedback about product performance\n\n\n**CATEGORIZATION GUIDELINES:**\n1. **Business Focus**: Think about what categories would be most valuable for business teams\n2. **Customer Impact**: Consider how these aspects affect customer experience and satisfaction\n3. **Strategic Value**: Choose categories that help prioritize product improvements and business decisions\n4. **Clear Boundaries**: Each aspect should fit clearly into one category with no ambiguity\n5. **OUT_OF_SCOPE Usage**: Use only for aspects that are truly unclear, too generic, or don't fit any meaningful category\n\n**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**\nReturn pure JSON mapping each aspect ID to its category ID:\n{\n  \"1\": \"C_0\",\n  \"2\": \"C_1\", \n  \"3\": \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\",\n  \"4\": \"C_2\",\n  ...\n}\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n- **Complete Coverage**: Every aspect ID from the input must appear exactly once in the output\n- **Valid Category IDs**: Use only the category IDs provided (C_0, C_1, etc.) or \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\"\n- **Pure JSON**: Return only the JSON object - no explanations or formatting\n- **No Duplicates**: Each aspect ID should appear exactly once\n- **Strategic Thinking**: Consider business and customer value when making assignments\n\n\n\n**PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN DATASET:** Dimmer Switches, Light Switches\nConsider how performance aspects relate to customer needs across these 2 product categories.\n\n**INPUT:**\n[0] connectivity: easy to connect
