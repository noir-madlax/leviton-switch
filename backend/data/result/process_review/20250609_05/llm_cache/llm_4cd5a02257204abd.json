    "prompt": "You are an aspect categorization specialist.\n\n**YOUR TASK:** Categorize performance aspects into the most appropriate categories from the provided taxonomy.\n\n**UNDERSTANDING THE DATA:**\n- Each aspect represents customer feedback about different product functionality and operational characteristics\n- Categorize each aspect into the most appropriate category\n- Use \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\" for aspects that don't fit well into any category\n- Focus on business value and customer impact when making assignments\n\n**AVAILABLE CATEGORIES:**\n**AVAILABLE CATEGORIES:**\n[C_0] Smart Home Integration: Aspects related to connecting and syncing switches with smart home systems, apps, and wireless protocols, e.g. Philips Hue app connectivity, HomeKit pairing, Zigbee bridge compatibility\n[C_1] Operational Reliability: Aspects concerning consistent day-to-day performance and dependability of switch operation, e.g. always working when activated, consistent response, no operational problems\n[C_2] Dimming Performance: Aspects specifically about the quality and effectiveness of brightness adjustment capabilities, e.g. smooth dimming operation, precise brightness control, full dimming range\n[C_3] Customization Capabilities: Aspects related to personalizing switch functions, scenes, and automation features, e.g. button programming, scene creation, automation setup\n[C_4] Installation Process: Aspects concerning the ease and complexity of physical switch installation and wiring, e.g. easy installation, wiring diagram clarity, neutral wire requirements\n[C_5] Build Quality: Aspects related to the physical construction quality and materials of the switch, e.g. well-built construction, high quality materials, sturdy design\n[C_6] Physical Durability: Aspects concerning the switch's ability to withstand wear and maintain structural integrity over time, e.g. paddle cracking, tab breaking, physical robustness\n[C_7] Product Longevity: Aspects related to how long the switch continues to function before failure or degradation, e.g. short lifespan, working for years, early failure patterns\n[C_8] Bulb Compatibility: Aspects concerning how well switches work with different types of lighting, e.g. LED bulb compatibility, multi-colored LED support, flickering prevention\n[C_9] Visual Appearance: Aspects related to the aesthetic design and visual integration of switches, e.g. matching wall plates, looking identical to brand-name switches, visual appeal\n[C_10] Light Flickering: Aspects specifically about unwanted light flickering behavior and stability, e.g. flickering on low settings, constant flickering issues, flicker-free operation\n[C_11] Noise Generation: Aspects concerning audible sounds produced by switches during operation, e.g. buzzing noise, humming sounds, quiet operation\n[C_12] Response Speed: Aspects related to how quickly switches respond to user input and activate lighting, e.g. activation delay, immediate response, lag time\n[C_13] Fan Control: Aspects specifically about controlling ceiling fan speed and operation, e.g. fan speed adjustment, fan motor control, fan-specific functionality\n[C_14] Feature Richness: Aspects concerning additional capabilities and advanced functions beyond basic switching, e.g. remembering settings, timed shutoff, brightness range\n[C_15] OUT_OF_SCOPE: Aspects that are too vague, generic, or unclear to categorize meaningfully\n[C_16] Basic Operation: Core switching functionality including turning lights on/off and basic operational performance, e.g. switch not working, functions well, works as expected\n[C_17] Smart Connectivity: Wireless connection stability and compatibility with smart home systems and voice assistants, e.g. works with Alexa, lost Wi-Fi connection, pairing issues\n[C_18] Safety Hazards: Dangerous electrical malfunctions that pose safety risks to users and property, e.g. switch exploded, internal arcing, causing power outages\n[C_19] Thermal Management: Heat-related performance issues that affect normal operation of the switch, e.g. overheating causing automatic shutoff when dimmed to maximum\n[C_20] Advanced Features: Specialized functions beyond basic switching such as timer operations and voice control limitations, e.g. timer doesn't allow dimming, won't dim by voice command\n[C_21] Purchase Value: Customer assessment of product worth relative to price paid, e.g. worth the money, great value, good value for money\n\n\n**CATEGORIZATION GUIDELINES:**\n1. **Business Focus**: Think about what categories would be most valuable for business teams\n2. **Customer Impact**: Consider how these aspects affect customer experience and satisfaction\n3. **Strategic Value**: Choose categories that help prioritize product improvements and business decisions\n4. **Clear Boundaries**: Each aspect should fit clearly into one category with no ambiguity\n5. **OUT_OF_SCOPE Usage**: Use only for aspects that are truly unclear, too generic, or don't fit any meaningful category\n\n**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**\nReturn pure JSON mapping each aspect ID to its category ID:\n{\n  \"1\": \"C_0\",\n  \"2\": \"C_1\", \n  \"3\": \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\",\n  \"4\": \"C_2\",\n  ...\n}\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n- **Complete Coverage**: Every aspect ID from the input must appear exactly once in the output\n- **Valid Category IDs**: Use only the category IDs provided (C_0, C_1, etc.) or \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\"\n- **Pure JSON**: Return only the JSON object - no explanations or formatting\n- **No Duplicates**: Each aspect ID should appear exactly once\n- **Strategic Thinking**: Consider business and customer value when making assignments\n\n\n\n**PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN DATASET:** Dimmer Switches, Light Switches\nConsider how performance aspects relate to customer needs across these 2 product categories.\n\n**INPUT:**\n[150] Electrical Safety: Switch exploded\n[151] Electrical Safety: Switch causes
