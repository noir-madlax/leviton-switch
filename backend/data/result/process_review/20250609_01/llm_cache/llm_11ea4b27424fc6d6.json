The dimmer worked fine, it was small enough to fit into electrical housing that was out dated. Thank You....\n1#Unit unable to stop LEDs from flickering. This item worked for a few weeks but then the dimmable LEDs started to flicker and no matter how one adjusted the little adjustment wheel it would not stop flickering and I tried a few different LEDs. Also the adjustment wheel can only be accessed after taking the cover plate off and it is sort of hard to move anyway. I would not recommend this item and would have returned it but it was past the return window.\n2#Reasonable price. Wonderful item üëå ‚ù§Ô∏è\n3#Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Works perfectly well in dimming my overhead LED lights. It also is slimmer than most dimmable switches so it was easier to put into the switch box\n4#Not the best. Unfortunately these are not good with LED drivers for puck lights. Fine with wafer LED's. Probably harmonics with cheap solid state electronics in the switch. Lots of flickering no matter how much it's adjusted. However, it's the only dimmer I found that could fit in a shallow old work box backed up to a column. I had no room whatsoever and these fit. Kudos on install, quality has a lot to be desired.\n5#Best LED Dimmer I've Tried! Bought four of these to dim down 27 LED lamps in a yoga studio (two rooms): 9 x 22W LED bulbs / 8 x 22W / 6 x 22W / 4 x 22W. This is the 3rd LED dimmer I bought / installed, and the only one to work as advertised. The little adjustment wheel does a great job of letting us dim the bulbs quite low for savasana with no flicker. We've been paying for incandescent light (and putting up with warm to the touch dimmers, overheating / failure prone bulbs) for too many years - LED tech (bulb color and rating) and dimmer tech has finally evolved to the point where we're not compromising on light quality. Nicely packaged, easy to install, very happy! Thank-you!\n6#Good & Easy. Nothing to dislike. Works great with 4 led lights on ceiling fan. Really helps. Zero noise/buzz.\n7#Fits as advertised! I was so happy when it actually fit into the very crowded box. I had been wanting to put a dimmer switch in the kitchen, but the box was way too full of wires. If your flip switch fits then so will these slim ones. Good looking and smooth action across the dimming range.",
