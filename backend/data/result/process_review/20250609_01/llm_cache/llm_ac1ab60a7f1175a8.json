This was an easy and inexpensive fix for a flickering lights caused by a dimmer switch issue for the LED light bulb replacements in my kitchen. It was a straight forward change and works well.\n1#Light flickered. Light flickered. Avoid.\n2#Good quality. Works perfectly.\n3#Great switch. Searched and searched for a rotary dimmer switch that would fit in the shallow switch box. Most were about an inch and a half deep. I only had a one inch box. This switch fit and worked great. Took about 5 minutes to change out.\n4#No está completo y está manipulado. El producto llegó incompleto, no trae el plato correcto, el que trae está incompleto o es el incorrecto\n5#Slim. Works great\n6#Quality of product. Product was easy to install, and worked perfectly.\n7#Item Defective - Failed To Work. Item installed by an electrician and failed to work. Item tested and found to be not working - completely non-functional.\n8#They don’t work. Unfortunately the return window closed on these before I could get someone to come install them. They are inconsistent in lowering the amount if light and flicker. Not a quality product, in fact they are useless.\n9#Prevents flickering. I had inverter air conditioner and it caused the LED lights to flicker. This DC controller stops some of that. I gave it a four because it is not an instant on. There is a slight delay when you turn the light on.\n10#Oky. The switches are good and easy to use\n11#Easy. Works like a champ I installed two of them\n12#JUNK, Partial, 20%, Dimmer only. Cheap, recessed, loose connectors, JUNK. This is a partial, 20% dimmer only, not a real 100% to zero Dimmer. Made cheaply, recessed loose connectors, Junk. Other 200 in facility dim 100%. This unit is Chinese Junk, waste of install time, removed ordered real dimmer.\n13#Going to return. The left-handed screws on the side of the switch do not come out far enough to allow me to get the wire under them. Very poor design. Cannot believe they sell them this way. Unsuable.\n14#Solid and works well. Easy to install, works well with the installed lights. Cycling works well, switch seems solid. Thanks!\n15#I wanted to love it, but just can't get used to the delay. Below is my original review. It works well, but it has a long delay when turning on the light, and it's just not something I can get used to. Will have to replace it with something else. ======================= It works like you'd expect any dimmer to, but it adds a great feature that most of the leading brands don't: an adjustment button that sets the minimum brightness level. Most dimmers let the lights go completely off when you go to minimum. This switch allows you to set a minimum so that the lowest setting doesn't completely turn the lights off. When you actually want the lights off, you push the switch. It's UL listed, so you can be confident in the safety level. Highly recommended.\n16#Works well. Works great and it can be easily adjusted if its output doesn't completely shut off your LED lights when placed at minimum brightness by pushing and holding a single button for a few seconds one time.\n17#He likes it dim, I like it bright. Put this dimmer in the kitchen and my wife loves it. Wife likes things bright for cooking. Super easy to install, very good quality and is aesthetically pleasing. It performs very well. Now we have the best of both worlds because I like them and she likes it bright. Happy wife happy life!\n18#Excellent control. Very smooth dimming, absolutely NO flicker. I only wish it were available in more than white.\n19#As expected. Switch was easy to install, dims well with no flicker.\n20#works great. switch was easy to install and works great\n21#New dimmer switch. Had it installed today, seems to be working fine.\n22#Saved me a trip to store. Needed a new dimmer for my bedroom. Saved me a trip to the store and worked perfectly. Instillation was easy. Thank you Amazon.\n23#Worked well for 3 weeks - now flickers on medium-brightness. This appeared to work flawlessly for around 3 weeks and all of a sudden it now causes my LED lights to flicker when on a medium-brightness. Unfortunately, I'll have to return it. Hopefully my LED lights are not damaged. UPDATE: Seller has been responsive and has promised to issue a refund. I will update when the refund is processed. UPDATE: Seller refunded in full. Dimmers still don't work with our dimmable LED lights (Progress Lighting P810013-028-30.) I'm updating to 3-stars. Although these dimmers do not work for us, they might work for you. Just be careful they don't break your LED lights.\n24#Firs perfect ! Like the product does what its supposed to do !\n25#Needs longer return policy. Purchased may1st it lasted for 2 months switch is bad . Return window was closed June 12\n26#It killed my LED bulbs. A few days later after installation, the two LED bulbs (dimmerable) connected to the switch died. Also, the bulbs do not turn on untill 2 or 3 seconds later after you push the switch on.\n27#Good quality, great features. This is a great dimmer and in a size that fits well in the junction box. I like the gradual on feature.\n28#Perfect for my dimmable led light bulb of my ceiling fan. No more flickering and easy to fix it\n29#Perfect. easy to assemble\n30#Works like any dimmer should. I have an older home and one of my walls is much thinner than the standard width. My old dimmer switch went bad. I had no luck in finding a replacement in any of the big box stores or even local hardware stores that usually stock stuff for older communities. Amazon had exactly what I needed, a low profile switch, and I received it in less than 24 hours. Perfect.\n31#Full Range dimming. It looks good and provides full range smooth dimming adjustment. One little thing is that there is subtle delay to turning on and adjusting.\n32#Works Exactly As It Should With A Bit Larger Knobby-Looking Dial Than I Was Used To. It works like a charm, exactly as pictured/described. The knob sticks out pretty far and is pretty big compared to what I'm used to, but it's white, clean, and works well. 10/10 Would buy again. Take a good look at the picture before you take the plunge. We like it.\n33#Gets rid of led light flicker. A digital dimmer that completley got rid of my flickering from the 10 led lights I installed in my ceiling. I replaced this dimmer from one I bought from wallmart that claimed it would work with all bulbs. A quality product with great documentation. Fast shipping and I will buy more in the future. It has a feature that allows you to lower the starting light level.\n34#An electrician may be helpful. This worked great to dim bright kitchen can lights. We use it after dinner is done to dim lighting in kitchen which is open to living room.\n35#Great idea, but maximum brightness is 75%, returned. Wired it in with dimmable LED fixtures - dims fine but maximum brightness is seriously dim - measured 27V drop (with true RMS meter) returned\n36#does not work on dimmable LED bulbs. it specifically is advertised to work on LED bulbs but its does NOT. I ended up purchasing a LUTRON LED dimmer which worked fine but was considerably more expensive.\n37#Easy to install as advertised. It’s a little flimsy compared to the ones from the 80s but it does the trick great combination with my dimmable LED kitchen light.\n38#Let there be light. Works great and easy to use will recommend\n39#Smooth adjustment. This is a nice switch. The dimming transitions are smooth. It's push on / off. I'm pleased. Installation was a breeze.\n40#Very satisfied! Very satisfied!\n41#Quality. Easy to connect, works great!\n42#Great dimmer switch. I was totally surprised to see it could be a 3 way switch. And another was I can pre set how dim I like the lite to come on. A little off of full blast or just barely going it’s made for the led light bulb so don’t have that little to low or to high just right every time. It’s UL listed built to last I would think a switch like that would be a lot higher price. But no complaints here!",
