    "prompt": "Extract comprehensive customer insights from reviews about Single Pole Rocker Switches.\nThe output format is JSON in English:\n{\n\"phy\": {\n\"<PHYSICAL>\": {\n\"<PID>@<DETAIL>\": {\n\"<SENT>\": [ID, …]\n}\n}\n},\n\"perf\": {\n\"<PERF>\": {\n\"<perf_id>@<DETAIL>\": {\n\"<SENT>\": {<PERF_REASON>: [ID, …]}\n}\n}\n},\n\"use\": {\n\"<USE>\": {\n\"<SENT>\": {<USE_REASON>: [ID, …]}\n}\n}\n}\n\nDefinitions:\n- <PID>: Unique ID for physical aspect (\"phy\"), starting from A. After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Single Pole Rocker Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Single Pole Rocker Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment. Include all mentioned reasons, or \"?\" if none can be inferred. <USE_REASON> and <USE> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- <PHYSICAL>/<PERF> and <DETAIL> MUST NOT include:\n  * Generic statements without details (e.g., \"good\", \"bad quality\")\n  * Issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., \"fast shipping\", \"delivery time\")\n- If a review mentions any physical aspect, related performance, or use together, extract them as separate entries under \"phy,\" \"perf,\" and \"use,\" with no overlap.\n- Make sure each <DETAIL> is under the most relevant <PHYSICAL> or <PERF> in the context of Single Pole Rocker Switches\n- Preserve negations\n\nKey Instructions:\n- Break down reviews with multiple aspects, performances, or uses into individual entries.\n- Escape special characters with backslash that could cause JSON syntax errors.\n- Include only explicitly mentioned reasons, and use \"?\" where no reason is mentioned.\n\nFinal Checklist:\n- Go through all reviews and ensure that no aspect, performance, use, or reason is omitted, even if only mentioned once.\n- Review all entries to ensure proper separation between aspects, performances, and uses.\n\nPrint the JSON result only.\nInput format:\n<ID>#<review>\n\n[[INPUT]]\n0#Worked great. Needed something quick without going to town. This worked wonderfully.\n1#Easy install and works great! Easy to install and works great!\n2#Comes in multiple colors to match any decor. Love that these are available in multiple colors!\n3#Would buy 10 pack of levitons instead. After buying one of these, I bought two 10 packs of leviton light almond decora switches. They feel the same quality, and the levitons are far cheaper. The only real difference is that the lutrons have slightly narrower buttons.\n4#Need to get correct item (as what's labled in box & in the order!). The actual priduct is great! However, this us the secind time ive had this order shipoed to my house, and it's becuase it keeps coming in\"white\" & not the Light Almond I've orderd. The outside of the box says light almond, but the actual switch inside is white. Arrgghhhh!\n5#Great value. Like Lutron products. See other lutron reviews.\n6#Can't go wrong with Lutron. High quality paddle switch ... Can't go wrong with Lutron. High quality paddle switch to pair with a screwless plate to spiff up a room.\n7#Servicable. Nice change from toggles.\n8#One Star. Color white, not light almond. Returned.\n9#replacement switch. Fits into existing space. Looks great!\n10#Five Stars. Very solid, well-made switch. Lutron is top quality.\n11#Great Switch. Bought this to control the garbage disposal ... Great Switch. Bought this to control the garbage disposal in the kitchen. Switch works well turning off and on. Bought to match other dimmer & timer switches from Lutron. The screw-less bezel gives these switches a very modern cool look. I Will continue to buy more to replace other switches in the house.",
