It’s great but the cover for the switch didn’t come as shown so I had to go and get covers for them\n2#Great product! These were simple to install and work exactly how they were intended. Would recommend to anyone doing some switch upgrades.\n3#Not bright. Don't expect much light from these. It only makes the switch visible , doesn't work as a night light.\n4#Great price and the illumination is very sufficient. We recently moved and needed these placed throughout the house. We're more secluded and light switches aren't all located in typical spots, so having them illuminated is much safer!\n5#Not a good buy and potentially dangerous. I guess it works as a switch but the night lights flicker and I'm going to have to pull them out. This makes me worry about underlying circuitry and mechanism. I will be pulling them out and at this point they are not returnable. I don't recommend buying these.\n6#Yes Definitely. These are great for my new home. It helps to navigate making it easier to find the switches\n7#Work as advertised. Work well so far. Kids love them for our hallway. Not very bright, but more than enough to find the switch and see where you are walking.\n8#You never knew you needed these. Awesome light switches love love love the night light aesthetic never knew I needed it as much as I do. Great for your kitchen or your bathroom and a great price.\n9#Bad quality. Bottom light doesn't work\n10#PICTURE IS DECEIVING! No cover plates!! DOES NOT COME WITH THE COVER PLATE!\n11#fantastic upgrade for my home. These switches have been a fantastic upgrade for my home, both in terms of functionality and appearance. love the motion sensor mode\n12#Cool lights but buy extra because they don't all work. We added a few of these to our new home because we couldn't find the light switches in the dark. We installed them with the light down. Out of the 4 lights, one of them has a slight flickering effect. The other three work great. The one that flickers still works but I will have to replace it. These have a nice modern look and help our guests find the light when using the bathroom and provide a little light to help navigate. I would recommend to others but be ready to deal with some of them not functioning and either prepare for return or buy additional. You might want to test these prior to installation to not get in the trap that I did.\n13#Blinding light not useful illumination. The light on this contraption shines UP against the wall as if illuminating a painting and blinds you as you pass by it at 3am on the way to the toilet, squinting from its burning glare and raising your hands in front of your face protectively like a vampire accidentally waking during the day. It should be pointed DOWN to illuminate your path. You might comment \"Well then why not install it upside down so the light indeed faces the way you wish?\" To which I would reply \"Are you mad? A switch must toggle up for on and down for off... to do otherwise would be chaos unbound!\"\n14#Sparks. After a few months of use and 2 of 4 installed one had to be removed due to malfunction. Turned on randomly and sparking when switching off. The other switch seems to be ok. Just beware of possible issues.\n15#Easy. Not very bright, but it was super easy to install and looks so much better than the old light switches\n16#Easy to install it. It is very practical and everyone is impressed with the night light. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is that I bought 4 of these, but one didn’t work. The problem is that I missed the return date, so if you buy it, install it as soon as possible just in case. Note: The one that didn’t work properly has a faulty night light. It turns on and off but the little night light doesn't work.\n17#Easy and efficient!! Yes, the insulation is easy. Shut off the power remove the old one and install the new one close it turn back on the power and flip the switch. It’s easy and no longer needing night lights around the house. Great idea thanks.!!\n18#Great for when you need a night light and no outlet. Sets a nice mood\n19#bought during our remodel to add night lights. highly recommend. We bought a home to remodel and wanted some night lights in the halls and bathroom etc. These have held up to the description and have worked flawlessly\n20#Great. Works great now I can find the switch\n21#Very dim, only points up. This light is very dim. The light only points up unless you want your switch to be upside down (ie you push the switch down to turn it on) so if that will bother you especially of next to another switch to not match (ex the bathroom fan) get the switch plate style of light. If my return window hadn't have already closed I could return these.\n22#dave your money. buy from anpther seller..we are remodeling home we have installed these and within 2 weeks need to replace them with other ones we buy at local hardware store and now no issues\n23#Cover plates not included. Product photos are misleading. The necessary cover plates are NOT included and must be purchased separately.\n24#Cool. Easy to install. Love the night light.\n25#These light switches are nice. I would have been happier if they were a little brighter.\n26#Cover was not included. The picture showed that it had a cover but I did not receive the cover. I wanted to order again but not sure if the order will include cover. Other items i ordered also showed pictures if covers but also were nit included.\n27#Break easy. They work great at night for seeing but don’t bump them the break easily\n28#Order arrived incomplete. Only the switches arrived. Cover plates are missing. Returning this order.\n29#CHECAR. ME LLEGARON SIN LAS TAPAS , SOLO LLEGO EL INTERRUPTOR, THEY ARRIVED WITHOUT THE COVERS, ONLY THE SWITCH ARRIVED,\n30#Led lamps do not light up at all. All 4 were defective. Not worth the time and effort to return\n31#Pass. This automatically turns on the night light when it is in the dark I used the bottom facing option but hate that the switch is upside down as in I push up for off and down for on. I will replace these and just use wall outlet covers with built in night light.\n32#Doesn’t come with the cover plates. Disappointed it showed up without new cover plates\n33#1 of the switches won't light up. Love the product but got 1 out of the bunch that won't light up, switch works fine little lights must be burnt out.\n34#Defective. I tried these switches twice and two of them my electrician advised me were defective. Returned them a month ago thr ups but never received my refund for this returned defective item.\n35#NOT AT ALL LIKE THE PHOTS STATES ON THIS PRODUCT. This item is not at all as bright as it says it is. I am very disappointed I would not buy this item but kinda stuck until I can find better replacement I bought 4 of these. I hope I can get my money back\n36#NIce Night light. Used this one in the garage that has no windows and gets very dark at night. Now it is easy to find the switch at night.\n37#Really cool. The wife can safely go to the bathroom at midnight without kicking anything. They are bright, but not so bright that it hurts your eyes as you are waking up\n38#A whole 20 minutes. The lights don't turn on. Paid $130 to get it installed\n39#No surround/cover included. The switch feels good in the hand, but now I need to buy 4 covers to finish the look.\n40#Awesome switches! These switches are a must have for areas where light switches are hard to find at night. Garages and bathrooms are typically areas that could benefit.\n41#perfect fit. replacing old light fixture\n42#Good for dark locations. Switch with a night light is great to direct you to the switch in a dark location.\n43#This is ONLY the switch. There is no face plate. It's just the switch. So unless you already have a face plate that this would fit into, you'll be caught out buying those.\n44#Little pricey for what they are. DOES NOT COME WITH THE COVER PLATE AS SHOWN IN THE PHOTO'S. DOES NOT COME WITH THE COVER PLASTE AS SHOWN IN ALL THE PHOTO'S...\n45#Safety first. Instead of having a bunch of night lights plugged in around the house, there switches provide an integrated solution at a reasonable price.\n46#Easy install. These are perfect to light up our hallways. Quick install\n47#Works as it should. The areas I used the switch for was a area dark at night & this switch made locating the switch location easy. The way the light only illuminates the area above the switch is attractive. 😊 The downside is the switch is stark white & most decor’s switches are a off white. The Chinese manufacturer should have known this.😱\n48#Very bad Quality. Selling three ways switch than works as a single pole switch.",
