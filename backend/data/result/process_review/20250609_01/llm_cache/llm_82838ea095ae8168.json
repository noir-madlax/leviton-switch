Not good. I'm certain the lights are compatible, and installation was correct, and they still flicker. I thought they were a great deal but you get what you pay for, unfortunately.\n1#They don't work. They didn't dim up or down they just stayed dim. I wish they worked the style was great\n2#Versatile, dimmer. Easy wiring, 3 way capability, pressetable sensitivity adjustable switch, great construction, bulk package, just some of the pros for me\n3#Not worth it at any price. Gave these a shot because of the price and I regret it. Every single one of them has my can lights flickering. They are very easy to install but that does not matter as they do not work. FYI, I am a professional remodeler and have never had this issue with Lutron dimmers. The customer I was working for wanted to save some money and it ended up costing them more as I had to replace every dimmer with one that actually works.\n4#Excellent. Easy to install and everything you need is included. The switch itself has a satisfying snap that is absent from a lot of switches these days, and the dimmer has just the right amount of resistance. Half a year after installation, they still work and feel the same. Great value too.\n5#Affordable option. Just installed. So far, so good. Paired with Feit LED bulbs. Did not notice humming or experience flicker at low dim yet.\n6#Switched off!! The rocker part of th switch pivots on two points that are l 1/8\" or less. 2 of the 6 I have purchased have had one side break off. So probably only 3 to 4 months of use. They were installed in the bathrooms. And 2 in my kids bedrooms.and in 1 kitchen light. Had 1 spare that was used to replace in the bathroom. I bought similar rocker panel switches for my entire house, just reg switches and no problem. Might be a different brand. I guess they work great as long as you don't over use them.\n7#Great quality for the price. I can’t stop buying these! They’re great, compact dimmers and fit well even in older boxes. I rehab houses and own multiple rentals. I like to replace old ceiling fixtures with really bright LED fixtures and replace the switch with a dimmer. I’ve used various LED bulbs and fixtures and haven’t had any flickering.\n8#Good, but TOO DEEP. The dimmer worked fine. The low setting was not quite as low as I would have wanted, but still within reason. The bad part is that the box containing the electronics is HUGE! I didn't know my electrical box is the shallow type & there was no way to position the wires and get the switch pushed all the way in. They sell another model that is slimmer that I'll be buying (now that I know!). I just don't understand why they don't make them all that way!\n9#They work. Replaced broken dimmer switches. They feel lighter than my others but they All work.\n10#Slider button is not comfortable to hurt finger. Dimmer selector is a little sharp on the edges easy to hurt your finger when you’re switching. The light on I prefer vertical and smooth selector.\n11#Pretty good for the price. First day I had 13 installed. I didn't notice any humming, flicker or being unable to dim to zero. You need to adjust the wheel. I did notice I had to swap out some bulbs if you have multiple bulb fixtures. I'll keep an eye on them over time and report back any issues. The bottom line is they work great for the price. Like others said they are a bit big to jam into the gang box, but I let the electrician do that. They only charged me $150 for all 13 switches. Not wasting my time for the install price. I also have 3 spares, so if one dies over time I can replace with same dimmer.\n12#Unnecessarily large, poor flicker control. Configuration and location of the wires is inconvenient and makes it difficult to install this in anything less than a deep box. The flicker control is flimsy and imprecise at best. When installed on multiple fixtures on the same circuit, it's impossible to eliminate flicker entirely. Spend a little more, and purchase switches with screw connections.\n13#Low quality dimmers that buzz. Returning. Low quality dimmers that buzz. Returning\n14#Dimmer range shallow. Dimmer range (low to bright) not very wide. Had 2 fail within 1 day\n15#Low quality, stopped working after 2 months. Bought a pack of six and a pack of two to replace old dimmers in the house and add a few new one. Noticed that the rocker in one of the switches is unstable and doesn’t turn the light on half of the time. Returned the pack of two which contained the faulty switch and installed the rest. Now after about 2 months of use, other switches are starting to show same symptoms one by one. It is too late to return them. Stay away from this brand and save money and time.\n16#Broken out of box. Bought a six pack. of these…only 4 worked…contacting company to see what they will do…said they would send replacements…it’s been 3 months nothing\n17#Jumpy dimming transition. I promptly installed all six of them and adjusted them for the lights they were controlling. The slide between bright and dim seems to catch, and also seems to have spots that don't adjust as you slide it I like the adjustable dimming, they work for what they are.. I will replace them with something better when they inevitably fail\n18#Broken used junk. I received 6 USED SWITCHES. Some broken. All with paint on them. All with cut wires. Absolutely useless and a total waste of money and time.\n19#It doesn't work and get stuck. It doesn't work expected with my LED recessed lights. sometimes it works sometimes not. I returned them and unfortunately paid extra money to my handyman for remove these and install another product. It did cost me much\n20#Quality, Value. As you can see from my pictures, I purchased a number of these dimmers, 3 way and spst switches from Bestten. They work well with a wide range of dimming, are a good value, look great.\n21#as good as it gets. what's not to like. they work great feel like and look like they're made well.\n22#Color is off. The color is off for the white. The dimmer and regular switches are from the same company, but the color of the item are off. Very noticeable. Would they have had the same white I would have gave them 5/5.\n23#Makes other leds from the same electrical box to flicker. Looks ok but makes other leds from the same electrical box to flicker. I am electrician and happened in 2 houses in two days. I had same experience with different manufacturer with same bottom style sliding dimmer before. On incandescent bulbs would be ok but not good for leds. I will add video.\n24#Reasonable price. They arrived on time and so far work great at a reasonable price.\n25#Dimmer OK. If you're going to install to install one units individually, this product will work fine. Nice looking when stand alone & it's easy to control. However, the problem rise if you're going to install two units together next to each other as the metal frame is too wide for the units be next to each other. Because the electric box frame is certain size, the wide metal frame that surrounds the switch will make it virtually impossible to be placed next to each other and fit under two units wall plate. Most of times, you would want the two units together in one place, but without removing the metal plate, this would be impossible.\n26#Excerpt! Five Stars. Five Stars!\n27#Sometimes it doesn't turn on the lights. I replaced one almost immediately because it sometimes didn't turn on the light and it had no *click* noise when switched up. So far all of them have that same no clicking noise and no light when that happens but not as bad as the first one. Would not recommend this switch, I really like tactile response with my switch and sometimes these don't work.\n28#Easy to install. Used the 6 dimmers with a variety of led fixture bulbs. Very easy to set up the minimum threshold and there wasn’t any flickering that I’ve seen in other reviews\n29#Great dimmers for LED lights. We recently installed LED ceiling lights and these dimmers works great. We can increase or decrease the amount of light we need. A great buy.\n30#When the light it blinks. would not recommend this product. Thought this would work great for our dimmable lights. when you try to dim them... they blink,...not just one but all the lights on the circuit\n31#Not Compatible with all LED recessed lights. This dimmer is defective and not compatible some recessed LED lights. My two LED lights are connected to one dimmer switch and when moved to very low setting, the lights start flickering and automatically turns off between 2min to 3min. Another switch connected to 6 LED lights and when moved to very low setting, four lights turns off and 2 lights keeps illuminated. I asked my contractor to install a Lutron dimmer and corrected the situation! They are way more expansive but they work everytime on any kind of lights.... It didn't work for me and will be returning back to Amazon.\n32#Great price and quality. At the time I ordered these they were nowhere to be found in the big box stores. They work, they are quality, they were easy to install and they arrived quickly\n33#Quality. Good quality for the price. I like it\n34#Works as intended. Have 4 of them installed so far. Single and dual pole locations. Wire are labeled for east install for either application. Tested with dimmable and non dimmable bulbs. Had some wild noises coming from the switch with non dimmable bulbs but works 100% as intended with correct bulbs.\n35#No good. I buy 6 dimer. 2 Are no working\n36#LEDs flickering. Do not buy if you plan to use more than 1 in a house as they cause each other to flicker.\n37#Excellent Flicker fx. Unfortunately I bought the 5 pack and waited too long to install them. So my return window has closed. Although they are rated for LED fixtures there is constant flickering. There is an adjustment dial which initially worked. But 5 min later a harsh flicker resumes. I tried 3 of them on 3 different fixtures. Now the good deal is $55 thrown away. Save your time and just do it right the first time. I wish I had seen a review like this before I purchased these.\n38#Dimmer function has failed on 3 of 6 switches. I am using these switches on LED lights, but have not been anywhere close to overloading them per the specifications. One switch had a total load of 36 watts, and initially worked OK, but now the dimming switch doesn't do anything. This happened again on 2 other switches. I do not recommend these switches and will pursue the warranty.\n39#Nice. Exactly as described and pictured. Great purchase.\n40#Are they really flashing. I think 1 out of 10 r bad on anything cheap At least got refund\n41#service was good. i like then because i use light bulb for my solar system\n42#Great value. Great deal for the amount of dimmers received. Not sure how stores compete.\n43#Bestten Rocker Dimmer switch Review. Beginning to replace the 13 a rocker dimmer switches installed by our electrician on our new home. The reasons I bought Bestten switch :1) looked like it would be an exact replacement for current switch. Looks ok and works. 2) at about $10 they are half the cost of a Levittown dimmer rocker. The bad news is the current rocker switches made in China are poorly made ( the plastic rocker breaks and the switch has a ball bearing that falls out when the plastic cracks…. The Bestten switch is also made in China, looks like it is built the same; and is similarly cheap. I expect some will fail in 2 years The durability ? Too early to tell…. Relatively easy to replace. Maybe Bestten made the plastic stronger?\n44#White color does not match other white switches. Purchased these because of the low price. They do work fine but the white color is much brighter than typical white switches so I will not be able to use these. Installed 2 out of 6 and will be replacing them all with a more expensive dimmer switch.\n45#Trash. Lights flicker. 3 of the 6 were open and previously used\n46#Good but not compatible with everything. These dimmers are good but they won’t be compatible with most of the ceiling leds. Buy Maxima, Lutron or any of those big brands. I’ve tried these with ensenior lights and didn’t work well, lights started to flicker etc...\n47#Great product. Awesome product. No flickering and very easy to install.\n48#Great product. I needed this for a house renovation. Great product for the price. I received all pieces and had no issues with installing.",
