Ordered & DID NOT WORK!!! Ordered 2 & when we finally needed to use it it DID NOT WORK!! Return window closed so not able to return it, I guess its my loss\n1#Exeelente. Buena Calida\n2#Lights flicker. I bought this switch in Nov. 1991 to control 6 LED floodlight in the kitchen. Within 2 months, we found the lights flicker intermittently, especially at about 50% of maximum.\n3#Good Buy. Works well. Easy to install. I needed to replace a beige colored switch with this white one. Couldn’t have been easier. Looks great!\n4#seems cheaply made. on off switch worked once then broke\n5#Intermittent switch after 5 years. After about 5 years of use, the switch is now intermittent. I sometimes have to press the switch 2-3 times before the light turns on or off.\n6#they work nicely. switches were easy to install and cane with 3 different color face plates which was nice....\n7#Perfect. We had previously purchased these at a larger box retailer but they stopped carrying them. So Amazon for the win! Now we were able to find the same match to retrofit the rest of our property. Switches are identical and are updated to use with dimmable LED.\n8#Cheap. The quality seems pretty sketchy. Lights are delayed on coming on after switch is flipped on.\n9#Not Great... We already have two of these in our home, and those work flawlessly. This one however does not seem to work. Unlike our others, this one is not backlit, and remains dark in a room. The wiring instructions are pretty straightforward, but it will not operate, behaving as though it's completely dead. This is regardless of whether the switch is depressed or where the slide is located. I'll take a closer look at it as we wrap up the project, but it will more than likely be returned for a refund. It's an unusual strike out for Leviton, which we've trusted for years.\n10#Flicker with LEDs. Initial major flicker/flash when turning on and some flicker when on, especially on low. Also, only dims about 50% of the light.\n11#Very cheap feeling. Always been a big Leviton fan, so this seemed like a no brainer. But I was so disappointed when I opened them up. Feels like cheap brittle plastic. Buttons don't feel secure. Not at all what I expected from Leviton.\n12#good dimmer but. Because of the three different colors of switch and on-off buttons offered in the box it makes the whole unit a little flimsey. In that you can choose what color you want to use but giving you that choice means you throw away two parts. Making the on-off switch and dimmer parts removable/interchangeable they have taken the solid plastic parts and made them flimsey. Once installed and screwed down they seem more solid. But if I was aware of the way this is made I would have chosen a different switch. As I wanted just white.\n13#Hard to program. Getting 2 into a double gang box is challenging and the programming instructions are not intuitive, but we got there in the end. Note they come with white, almond and beige fronts in one pkg.\n14#Works great with LED bulbs in my dining room light. Happy that there is no more flickering\n15#This dimmer has the same face as the Illumatech IPI06. This matched the decor and design of all my other switches and dimmers. The LED chandelier bulbs did flicker (no built in driver) at a high setting but I was able to use the new dimmers program to eliminate that issue when full “On”. I would only recommend using this dimmer to replace the Illumatech incandescent model (Leviton IPI06) so that the wall switches all look the same. That’s why I bought mine.\n16#Compatible with certain TCP led lights. Not all led bulbs work with certain dimmers. Love TCP leds. 75% of my lighting is LED. TCP specifically tells you by model number which dimmer is compatible. This one was recommended and works beautifuly.\n17#Works well enough that I ordered a second one. Works as expected. Complaints by others that the button feels a bit cheap are true, but it is just lose so that the button plate can be interchangeable with the other supplied colors. You need to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS (yes I know I never do that either). Under the switch face plate is small switch to change from INC to LED bulbs, you can calibrate the slider to better span the whole dimmer brightness range, and there are little side wings that need to be removed with a pliers before you can install them side by side in a multi-gang box. Other than that easy enough to install, although I had to straighten the wire (which was on a screw terminal on the previous switch) and clip it to put it in the pigtail connecter clip ... took me a few minutes to ponder that, as most plugs with pigtail clips also have side screws. Not rocket science and, again, if I had read the instructions first ;-).\n18#Badly Engineered Product. I can't make enough critical comments about these Leviton products. They were put into a new house by the contractor and, one after another have failed. To make it worse, Leviton keeps changing the wire color coding making replacements a real pain. In addition there are numerous design miscues eg. the mounting plate wing brakeaways don't brake away. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this manufacturer's products.\n19#Great! quality product!\n20#Good. Seams well built. Dimmer works well and is easy to use\n21#worked well. Works well. Easy to install. Plastic buttons are in a bit thin.\n22#Good color match. changed an old swich\n23#Good product easy to use. Dimmer did not make it as bright as I wanted\n24#works fine, takes up a lot of cubic fill in j-box. The switch works fine, and the interchangeable face covers are easy to swap. my only Issue was the back part of the switch , (the part that would go into the junction box) takes up so much room, it is hard to get into the J box. if you have a ton of wires to tuck in forget it. larger volume box may be required to fit this in.\n25#Seems to work fine. The problem is more me than the unit. Rewiring into a 3 way circuit took a few tries. Possibly some added directions could help.\n26#Easy to install. Straightforward installation; works for 2-way and 3-way circuits. Switch feels solid and should last a good long time.\n27#Fix It. Parts worked well for a repair.\n28#Works perfectly. I used this to dim nine 60 Watt equivalent dimmable LED's in a chandelier, dimmer performs as stated. I can dim the LED's until they go out, with no flicker. You can turn the lights on or off from a single push button while keeping the same brightness level. Threshold brightness (lowest preferred) can be set directly on the dimmer and simple to adjust.\n29#The on/off button hangs-up, you need to wiggle it to pop out. The only problem I have is that the on/off button hangs-up after pushing it. The changeable color plates are a great idea.\n30#Great concept; execution not so much. Great concept selling 1 switch instead of 1 per color. Unfortunately the cover has come off twice already. In addition the actual slider has a small travel length.\n31#French & Spanish, NO english. Had too many wires for my application and NO English instructions.\n32#Perfect!!! Easy to install, look nice, good price. Super fast shipping\n33#Great. Bathroom switch\n34#Works on LED. Works great for LED kitchen lights. No flicker and good range of dimming.\n35#Quality. Replacement\n36#Easy For A Professional. I only allow licensed electricians to do anything electrical in my home. I purchased 3 LED fixtures to replace 1998 vintage fixtures using incandescent bulbs. I had no dimmer switches in my home. This model switch was on a list of recommended models from the fixture manufacturer. My electrician had these installed in no time. I ordered the appropriate \"snap on\" plates to avoid having screws. It's a nice look.\n37#Good deal. Needed a quick replacement and this was a great no hassle alternative purchase without leaving the house to the hardware store lol\n38#works well. These were for my entrance area ceiling lights that have LED bulbs. Went it without a hitch!\n39#Great Switch Value & Quality. Great product for the price plus it comes with 3 cover plates to match the color white, almond, off white.\n40#Click button on/off - smooth dim, no flicker. After much research and testing this is my favorite dimmer. Love the push button on/off switch. There is also a mininimum brightness adjustment which can be changed - nice feature if needed. No flicker or noise from My Phillips bulbs. Love this product\n41#great. Great product completely satisfied\n42#Works great. Good quality\n43#Worked perfectly and exactly as described. We had another product installed and it failed, whereas this switch worked great and is easy to operate for my mother. large on/off switch and dimmer was large for her ailing rheumatoid arthritis in her fingers. The multiple colors also helped with what style we wanted to install. The LEDs did not flicker like previous light switches we tried in the past.\n44#This dimmer works and works well ! This product works!!! There is no buzzing sounds from the switch, and the lights do not flicker when they are dimmed. Please remember to use dimmable bulbs that are LEDs or CFLs. I have purchased other dimmers that did not work. This dimmer also works with regular Incandesent bulbs. When the lights are dim they go down about 80%. There is also a switch at the bottom of this switch to turn the light on and off. Art\n45#Just turns on the light and doesn’t dim. I can’t get it to dim the light.",
