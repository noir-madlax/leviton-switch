After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Smart Wi-Fi Enabled Dimmer Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Smart Wi-Fi Enabled Dimmer Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s.

Quality switch, easy to add to HomeKit, I wish they dimmed further. The 2-way switches dim the lights significantly more, at the lowest setting it's too bright for me.\n1#Dead. Lights can’t be turned off!!! First one I installed has now locked in the on position. Unresponsive to WiFi AND the physical switch. Completely defective. Out of return window for Amazon.\n2#Started great but failed after a couple of months. Connected well to the phone and Siri but it flickers all the time. I installed it at 4 different locations and the flickering is so annoying. I like their other products tbh but this light switch was a disappointment. The problem could be something else but we have other dimmable light switches in the house and those are always fine. This was a waste of money.\n3#Flawed design. They are great if they work. When (and not if) they crash - a weird concept for a light switch, but essentially disconnect from the WiFi - the physical switch buttons will stop working as well! One has to switch the circuit breaker from the panel off and on to “restart” the switch.\n4#Used Switches in a Sealed Box! I bought a bunch of these switches (like 30) a little over a month ago. I recognize that’s a while, but I bought them for a new house and am just getting moved in. While I’ve installed about 20 and they’ve gone well so far, when I opened my last “4 pack” I was surprised to find that the switches were used! Granted, the box was completely sealed. 2 of the switches were some old style switch and all had seemingly been installed previously (look at the photos of the wire ends). Also, one of the old style had a yellow post-it note that says “bad” on it! How does this happen?!?! Amazon is refunding, but it still screws up my install process (and they couldn’t care less), plus I have to go through a reorder process to re-buy them at a now increased price! They say they’ll adjust the price for me if I contract them again after I receive the new product. What a pain… the process just seems to get worse and worse with Amazon. On the switches, I’d say they’re easy to install and setup and they integrate seamlessly with HomeKit. I have no complaints at all about the new/working products and would recommend them, but I might not recommend buying the 4 packs and possibly buy them from someone other than Amazon (maybe Meross directly). My rating: 5 stars for the working products, -5 stars for the 4 pack and 2 stars for Amazon support.\n5#Works great! Easy install. Connects easily to Apple HomeKit. So much better than my old smart switches.\n6#great product. easy to install\n7#Reliable, responsive, and easy to set up. Just as easy to install as any other light switch, and connecting them to a smart home is straight forward. I’ve had them for a while now and had no issues with connectivity.",
