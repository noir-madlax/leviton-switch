Work awsome! Proce is awsome to\n1#Flickers- poor quality. I have 10 of these and every one of them flickers\n2#Do not purchase. Do not purchase!!!! I’ve had to replace every single switch. More than half stopped working within 2 months of installation. Now we are replacing all switches.\n3#Unreliable. I ordered a 6-pack of these and have had a lot of difficulty getting them to work correctly. 3 of the switches are now installed. The first has some occasional buzzing and flickering. The second seems to work very well. The third will only turn on the fixtures right after I flip the breaker; subsequently, the switch doesn't turn on the lights. I tested the fixtures with another brand of switch and it works. I've got 3 more of these I don't plan on using.\n4#Light switch keeps getting stuck. Within 6 month of installation, switch is not working. It has lost the spring action and one has to press very hard to turn it on and off. I am not happy with the quality. I would like to know if I can request refund or the replacement.\n5#Great price and look great. I just added recessed lighting all through my home and wanted dimmer switches. These are a great price and look and work great.\n6#Buzzing noise. Got around to installing these switches, and unfortunately they buzz when they are turned on regardless of dimming level. Past the return window. Would appreciate product support.\n7#Garbage product. No matter what bulb, whether it is on high or dim, these dimmers flicker. If you ask me, they are just the bunch of garbage\n8#Flickering and buzzing. I bought these abiu two years ago and installed them for all led lights. Almost all of them flicker and need to be replaced. I dont think they are unsafe but the buzzing and flickering are problematic even on single led lights.\n9#Switch makes buzzing sound. Bought a box as we are upgrading the house, however, these switches don't work properly, when light is at max bright, switch makes buzzing sound, and sound goes away when dimmer is at low. Also, switches are not durable, extremely disappointed.\n10#As advertised. Great value and easy install\n11#So glad I ordered the six-pack, great performance, low unit cost. Ordered the six-pack late in the day and got them in on Prime the following morning. I installed the first two switches that following morning. The first one went into our den, where I had an ancient slider switch that had a broken slide handle. The other one went into our kitchen dining area, next to the den. So glad I opted for the six-pack as the unit cost per switch was closer to $9 each. At my big box stores all the sliders were in the $20+ range, which I felt was just too much. As for the promises of 'reduced flickering', that was one of the problems with our den ceiling lights. I'm running six of them. And with the old dimmer I had problems setting the lowest light level. The dimmer would either shut off or flicker. With the new dimmer, I can slide the switch to the lowest level, get a very low level light from the ceiling, and it holds steady. It's like a 'night light' level. So yes, this switch operates as I've wanted, but didn't have with the old switch. Overall, what with unit cost so low, and performance so high, I can only say that I'm hoping these dimmers last for at least three years. I'm guessing they'll go further, as our old dimmers did have long-life as one feature.\n12#The problem is every single one of them are bad. I’m a contractor. I never seen this before. I never use this product before every single one of them are flickering on LED lights. It’s because it doesn’t handle power so I switch to different brand and works great.\n13#Failed within days of installation. We installed 6 of these in a remodel and one has completely failed after less than a dozen uses.\n14#ELEGRP dimmers flicker with 6 inch led disk lights. had to purchase another product to eliminate flickering\n15#Flickering with led. This product states it works With led it doesn’t makes them flicker like crazy\n16#Flickering. These are not working well, I buy these quite a bit, They are flickering, Im going to need to go back to job and replace with another product\n17#Good dimmer. Dimmers have built in glow light looks good\n18#Exactly as advertised. Moved into a new house that has LED canned lighting retrofitted in but no dimmers, popped these in and they work great, fit right into the same outlet covers and everything.\n19#Very cheap quality. Flickering. Go buy switches from home depot or menards instead. My dad is a master electrician and has seen a lot of stuff. He said they are made very cheap compared to ones at menards or home depot and those places have cheap electrical stuff when compared to electrical supply companies. I put them in my house regardless because I already purchased them. BTW they are the same price as the ones at menards or home depot. Only half work the others randomly flicker at different rates. We took a switch apart and found loose connections everywhere. The only positive is that they are pretty looking but they look the same at menards. Anyway I don't reccomend buying these\n20#KNOWN ISSUE: Bad flicker when used on 3-way. 3- way installation doesn't function. It flickers, period. This is a known issue, has been for more tyhan a little while, as the reviews show. I very much wanted to like these, but they are entirely disappointing. Worst is the flickering-- at about 50% dim, these flicker like a light show. So they really don't do what they're supposed to do. And now I have to uninstall them and install new ones. Also, these are clearly meant for stab on connection, because the screw terminals are maddeningly difficult to use, unless you're comfortable working upside down.\n21#Easy to install, but check the dim slider when you receive them. These are easy to install, but some have a defective slider. I didn't install them at the same time and realized the problem months later.\n22#Very affordable option if used right. I have seen reviews about flicker and stuff. But with the right bulb, there is no flicker and no noise. Just perfect. Easy to install and easy to work with.\n23#Had to replace all of them with Lutron (updated). The LEDs in every room flickered with these dimmers and we had to replace the entire house with another brand. Totally solved the problem. Update: this seller saw this review and issued a full refund on the dimmers. That is appreciated but it would be best if they just worked with my LEDs in the first place.\n24#Priced well. CFL bulbs come on full/highest brightness level first, for about a second, and then adjust/go to the last setting used. It’s a little nuance but for the price… perfect. Thank you.\n25#continuous flickering of light. continuous flickering of light\n26#They squeal when dimmed. Thought they were nice but sadly they make a strange squealing/buzzing sound when lights are dimmed. Reached out to get customer support and got no response. Unfortunately they are past return date. Would NOT buy.\n27#3 way problem. Single way looks work fine. But used 2 more in the kitchen with the 3 way wiring, made the lights flicker and strobe. Will be leaving the lights off.\n28#Doesn't work for LED lights. Review comments and vid posted by other buyers are 100% accurate. This dimmer is junk, it causes the LED lights to flicker nonstop especially at low light level. You can even hear the dimmer buzzing really loud. After replacing this dimmer with other brand, all issues are gone, so it's not the lights. This dimmer is junk.\n29#Garbage. This is the first Amazon review I've ever written. Had these for less than a month and everyone caused lights to flicker. Needless to say, they're all in the garbage now. Spend a little more and get switches with some quality control.\n30#good quality. Used when I repair houses very nice and arrived fast\n31#Flicker free, no exactly. Bought these based on the dimming ability and they said they were flicker free. However if you have turned all the way up on the dimmer the do flicker. These were professional installed on new high end fixtures , very frustrated.\n32#dimmer. good pricing\n33#Low quality dimmer switches. I thought these would be a great option for my house after installing and getting dimmable bulbs for the fixture almost every single one of these dimmers flicker really bad. Decided I hated dealing with them so I put the standards switches back and threw these away.\n34#Easy to install and has a low and high dimmer with a night light! Love the easy installment and nightlight.\n35#The perfect look that we were looking for! Can’t get these toggle switches at the big box stores.\n36#Flicker but. After several months the dimmers started to cause custom pendant lights with dimmable edison lamps to flicker intermittently,this might be caused by fluctuating power issues on circuit or these switches. When time allows ill troubleshoot and hope to post back 40 yr. Electrician\n37#Flickers with LED's. Works but flickers with dimmable LED's. Tried it on several brands of bulbs. Very annoying.\n38#Not consistent. Flicker issues. I purchased a bulk pack of these switches. Some flicker and some do not. All the settings are the same inside and the home is new with new lights. I did not have this problem with the regular builder grade switches the house came with.\n39#Great, inexpensive switches. Great, inexpensive switches - nice locating light in them\n40#6 months later and they buzz and flicker now. I installed these in May on 4 single pole connections and all of them either buzz or flicker when dimming. They stop flickering at lowest setting or highest setting. But they do buzz on the highest setting on 1. Buyer beware. I know have to consider replacement for fear of fire hazard. Edit: the company offered me a refund or replacement. I’ll give them 3 stars for good customer service.\n41#Most are still working. I would say I got what I paid for but I think you can actually pick up less expensive dimmers that also have WiFi capability from Home Depot. I have to regularly remove the face plate and mess around with the switch on a few of these to get them to start dimming again. I have one that has completely stopped working. When I adjust the dimmer switch, it doesn't dim at all. If I remove the plate to test and physically push inward, it works. So there's some sort of defect and it's only been about a year. So I'll be swapping them out with the Home Depot ones from here on out.\n42#Don’t buy. Do not buy this product it is bad, it makes the lights flicker No lo compren hace que las luces parpaden constantemente\n43#All my lights now flicker. I bought 2 bundles of these. At first they were just ok but a couple months went by all my lights at full power started flickering. They have a lot of good reviews so I did not bother reading them. Guess I learned my lesson on that. Now that I read the reviews I see buried amount the great ones all the flicker issues people are having. I now question the integrity of all those reviews. Don’t buy these. There is a reason they are inexpensive….. they are cheap. I’m removing them because I’m now afraid of a fire.\n44#Great quality, Great quality , just be sure the Dimming ability works on one side you can’t really use to switch at the same time time\n45#Great price. Great product easy installation\n46#Flickering Lights. They all flickers even though it was advertised as non flickering. Very disappointing.\n47#Great quality. Works great",
