The switch works great for us. The dimmer has a good range to control the brightness and this style allowed us to match all of the other paddle switches in the house. We have replaced all of our dimmer switches in the house with these switches and they have had no issues.\n1#Wrong Labeled 450W - not even for 200W. You can hear buzzing over 200W LED.\n2#Great dimmer switch. I took one star away for price/value, I feel it’s a bit expensive. But overall the quality and function are great. Easy to install. No flickering, very seamless use.\n3#Rocker Dimmer Switch. Used his new switch in our newly remodeled kitchen for the overhead ceiling LED lights and it works great!\n4#Very clean look. Installs easily, just don't over tighten and pull the plastic carrier in too far. It should fit flush against the wall unless the drywall is very uneven. If you use electric box extension rings (available from the big box stores) to adjust the gap, make sure to use the long no. 6 flat head screws: any screw heads sticking up will prevent the plate from meeting the wall.\n5#Obsessed!!! This is the best brand for switches & gang plates! They are larger, decor style & so upscale. We bought and replaced every single socket in our new home and it truly helped complete each room!\n6#Beautiful. Wonderful Easy Good Looking Functional Light Switch with Dimmer. One Ground Easy placement One Black to upper left. One Black to lower right. Any other way has the switch working opposite.....\n7#Excellent Replacement. It's been months since I've replaced my dimmer light switch. So far so good, I trust legrand brand for all of my receptacle needs. If you're replacing an older switch the load may be opposite on the new switch. DOUBLE CHECK!!\n8#not good. did not dim my LED string lights. String lights are dimmable and other dimmers work, this did not. lights are full then flicker when dimmed about 10% then go all the way to a very soft glow at any lower setting.\n9#Great product. Smooth slider! Love the square design.",
