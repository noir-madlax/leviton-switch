Great dimmers! So much so that I have installed them throughout the house. Great product at a great price and very easy to install with some basic tools. Just make sure to turn the power off at the breaker before you start your install!\n1#Dimmer switch. Exactly as exoected, perfect color match, which I could not find in any local stores.\n2#This switch is beautiful and solved a LED light flickering issue from a cheaper switch. I purchased the light almond model. I was a little worried about the color since the image shown on amazon does not do the switch justice. Added my own images of the empty box and the installed switch used my old faceplate.\n3#Getting LED compatible dimmers matters (buzzzzzzzzzzzzz). We upgraded lighting to LEDs and older dimmers can buzz, or make the bulbs buzz.\n4#East to install. Works great. Installed in my kitchen, for LED lights\n5#This is my favorite. I have used a number of these. It is really nice.\n6#expensive, but worth it. I had cheaped out and bought a Chinese \"clone\" of this dimmer switch. It dimmed just fine, but the switch itself was flakey - I mean, who in this day and age has come across a flakey wall switch? I do resent the fact that Lutron charged top dollar for all their switches, and this one is certainly the plainest of the plain jane variety - no soft on/off, no led display, just a switch and a slider. But it just works, so it's worth the cost.\n7#Well Made. Easy to operate\n8#Had to return as we did not use it. Didn't actually open this. Ended up not needing it. Was delivered fast & easy to return at Khols.\n9#NOT AS ADVERTISED. The online product specs as well as on the product package itself claims that the product has a \"dimming range lever to improve bulb performance\". I searched every inch of the product before putting the faceplate on and there is no such lever. Getting any help on the problem from Lutron's computer system support or a real live customer rep was impossible.\n10#Smaller than existing plate. How can they make a replacement plate that is smaller than the existing one. The drywall gap shows when this is used. Useless item.\n11#Much better than alternative dimmers. I have tried many different styles of dimmers now. I prefer this one over all others because the most-often-use-case (simply toggling the switch on and off) is the easiest activity to do since the dimmer does not change how the decora rocker works fundamentally. Dimming the switch, is more difficult than other dimmers. But I feel this tradeoff is worth it since dimming is done so much less frequently than simply turning it on/off.\n12#Bren. Good but it blinks the light if turned down some\n13#Dimmer adjustability non-existent. Nice looking dimmer / plate. Easy to replace existing 3 way switch. Instructions basically very good and they even note the internal dimmer adjustment may be in 'different' location then shown. All true. But, Dimmer adjustment did not slide, turn, push, pull or move in any direction. Basically SET at factory. I would have liked to dim the lights a wee bit more but will live with the factory setting. Have never had this issue with other dimmers from Lutron.\n14#Great quality dimmer switch. Great quality dimmer switch. Lives up to Lutron name. Looks attractive. Easy to install.\n15#Dimmer works great with LED lights. Works great with the Dewenwels LED dimmable bulbs I bought to replace halogens\n16#Great item. Great switch and price\n17#Clear instructions, easy to install. This is exactly what I needed: A simple dimmer switch for a light in my home office. Do not snap the front faceplate on until you are sure it works, and have it placed where you want it.\n18#Excellent choice for. Perfect match to Hubbell Lighting LBSLEDA10L30K9 WH Prestolite Led Surface Mount Fixture, Round, 3000K, 1,000 lm, 90 CRI, 120V, White. very broad range of adjustment. Follow the instructions, be careful, and you'll be fine. Placed it in a home office/game room with 6 of the Hubbell lights. No problems.\n19#Works as advertised. I replaced all 10 of my bathroom lights with LED’s. When I turned them on I didn’t realize how bad I looked so ordered this dimmer to to tone down the lumens. Installs easily and works very well. I feel better about myself now.\n20#Easy to install. Works perfect as intended to make our foyer light dimmable!\n21#Worked with LED Dimmable Bulbs. Apparently LED technology is not universally compatible. My house was built in 1971. I was happy that this dimmer was compatible with the house wiring and the dimmable bulbs I purchased.\n22#These dimmers work great with LED’s. Unlike some dimmers sold at big box stores that claim to work with LED’s and halogen lights, this one does. Nice range of brightness, no flickers, flashes or buzzing.\n23#Took 5 minutes to install. Easy to install\n24#Good LED lamp dimmer. I purchased this dimmer control to replace a 20 year old dimmer. The old dimmer really showed its age when I installed new dimmable LED bulbs with flickering. Now with this new dimmer switch, the LED bulbs can go from zero to 100 percent without flickering. I didn't care for the new style wall plate that came with this switch, so I used the wall plate that was already there without any issues. The Amazon price of $16.26 was only 60% of what Lowe's charges for the exact same thing. Very pleased!\n25#Stylish and functional. This switch was purchased to replace an older dimmer switch. The older switch was not designed for LED bulbs and with it, dimming range was limited, very sensitive to set and an overall pain. The new switch with the slide dimmer solved those problems. Dimming range has been extended, getting the exact desired light effect right and the ease in doing it all make this switch a keeper. I also like the snap on cover plate which doesn't require screws to attach leading for a cleaner look.\n26#Good purchase. I installed this in our bedroom. I had no prior experience with switching light switches, but found the directions easy to follow. It controls an LED light fixture and works great.\n27#as advertised. worked perfectly\n28#Quality product. Good quality, easy to install\n29#Does the trick. Great light switch! I like that it was easy to install & that the faceplate snaps into place while covering the screws making it a clean look. The rocker is a bit stiff to turn on/off but I don’t mind\n30#Wrong Color. I ordered 3 dimmer switches in light almond color.....when they arrived my initial thought was that they looked almost white. I bought the same dimmer switch from HD in light almond for comparison. ….yep.....they are white.\n31#Works good. Works well for my led lights. Easy to install in just a few minutes. Would and have bought again. It’s nice to be able to set the low end.\n32#Great Product - Excellent Dimmer for LED Flood Lights. I replaced a standard switch in a three switch circuit with one of these dimmers connected to ten ceiling can lights equipped with FEIT Electric 65W LED flood equivalents (11 watts each)-which are actually brighter than the 75 watt incandescent bulbs we replaced with the LEDs-at least to my eye. This dimmer works beautifully with the LED bulbs, without any flickering whatsoever. As with any dimmable LED bulbs, when the bulbs are dimmed, the light emitted becomes a bit whiter and \"cooler\" than when the bulbs are at a brighter setting, which gives off a warmer light. But that isn't the fault of the dimmer; it just seems to be an inherent issue with LED bulbs generally. I was highly skeptical that a dimmer such as this would work so well with 10 LED flood lights in the dimmer's circuit-but I thought it would give it a try. This dimmer not only met my most optimistic expectations...it greatly exceed my expectations. It was also easy to install (even in a three-switch, four-way circuit), with clear installation instructions. And the best part is that it is a beautiful switch that matched other Lutron switches in our home. I thought that in order to connect a dimmer to that many LED floods, I would need to install an ugly switch that extended from the wall. Not so.\n33#GREAT FOR LED BULBS. HAVE BEEN USING LUTRON DIMMERS FOR 30 YRS BEST U CAN BUY ALOT CHEAPER ONES BUT NONE BETTER\n34#Very nice light switch. Works great, easy to install.\n35#WORKS GREAT! This ON/OFF DIMMER SWITCH for a ceiling light works fine. The dimmer slider is very tiny. That allows it to match the standard toggle switches for aesthetics, but it would be easier to use if the dimmer-slider were a little larger. It works as advertised and I didn't find anything available that was better for my needs.\n36#Broke in 1 month. Dimmer broke in a month but got a free replacement from Lurton. We shall see how this works\n37#Works. Fit in the existing switch box. Does what it is supposed to do. It fit in the existing switch box in my 1959 rambler. Nothing to not like about it.\n38#Easy to install. This was a great design - installation was a snap.\n39#Great dimmers. Great dimmers. Work well. Happy with the purchase.\n40#Good price and delivery. Good quality dimmer switch. Good product. Met my expectations.\n41#Good stuff. Give me full control to adjust as needed. Happy so far!!\n42#Quality LED/CFL Dimmer Switch. Liked this switch so much, I bought 3 of them for the LED downlighting over the dining room table, kitchen counter and for the LED light strip in the big bathroom. This dimmer switch doesn't take up so much space inside switch box as other higher power models appear to do. Installation and operation is simple and easy. The screw-less switchplate cover is really nice looking too.\n43#Quick install, works as advertised. NO push-in wiring. Works great. One thing to know, the switch is flush on the front, but takes up a lot of space in the outlet box. Also, they're twist-wire connections, no option for push-in wiring. Compatible with three wire (2+ switch controlling the same circuit) installations. ~Mike\n44#Good product at a fair price. Works great\n45#only turns on when dimmer is on \"low\". switch does not work when dimmer is on high; you need to turn on your light with dimmer on \"low\" and then slowly dim up (used with amazonbasics dimmable leds)\n46#LED lights still buzzing. It has a better dimming and slightly lower noise but all lights still buzz when turned ON so didn't really work as expected",
