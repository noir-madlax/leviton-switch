Easy switch\n1#Best dimmer. No issues. I have installed 12 of these and every one of them worked. No flickers on LED lights and can bring down to zero level. I also used on 3-way switches. Best dimmers w/ 600 watts rated\n2#Not LED Compatible. I put a ton of these in my house and had to take them all out that were tied to LED puck lights. The Smart Dimmers work great but the Standard digital dimmers interfere with each other when you have multiple circuits active. So if I turn on one room they are fine but when you turn on another room near it they will cause flickering. It is 100% the switch and not the lights.\n3#Faulty chinese crap. Half the light switches didn't work. Dont bother wasting the time to install only to find out it doesn't work over and over. They should pay me for the electricians time.\n4#Cheap, but not good. Flicking and make a lot of noise. No customers service, the problem is not of 20 switches I bought, but my 3 different brands of lights.\n5#Does NOT work with triac dimmable accessories. UPDATE: the seller was very kind and offered my a refund for the inconvenience. I really appreciate the great customer service. —- The dimmers did NOT work with my triac dimmable rails even though on the description it said it was compatible. My installer said this happens when the dimmers are not high quality… im very disappointed and wasted my money on product and installation.\n6#Not worth the money. DON'T buy these. Not worth your time installing, they don't dim light fixtures that are made to work with dimmer switches. They made our lights flicker or they only went from on to barely on to off. There was no comfortable middle ground on these switches.\n7#Poor quality. Very poor quality after I had an electric install over 18 of this dimmer throughout my house half of them are broken. When you try to dim the light up or down the little handle is loose. and all the dimmers have a delay when turning on the light Don’t waste your money on this dimmers.\n8#Not good and accurate production. I’ve got a box of 10 of this item but they are not good . My customers have a problem with flicking. And buzz.it does not have precise light control!\n9#Led flickers. LED lights flicker with this dimmer. Cannot return since it's been 30 days.\n10#Great switch. Adjustable lowest level so you can adjust lowest so the light does not go off unless you use the switch. LED can be left on or off. Nice feature for a dark room to see the switch. Not overly bright... just a small light.\n11#Great value. Works great and has a 3 way option. Way better price than the store.\n12#Perfect for the look we were going for! Couldn’t get these in the big box stores!\n13#Excelente. funciona muy bien en Colombia. Producto de altísima calidad. Fácil de instalar y con las guías y videos que son de gran utilidad. Y fue super compatible con las SUNCO 8 Pulgadas Luz Empotrada de 5 CCT - LED.\n14#Terrible. Lights flicker. I bought these dimmers for my house when I remodeled it. Within a few weeks the lights began to flicker. After countless hours of electricians, utility company personnel and my own hard work, we realized the dimmers were poor quality and the source of aggravation. My suggestion: Stay away from these dimmers. They cause your lights to flicker. And nobody wants that.\n15#Nice upgrade for LED bulbs/lights. Needed to upgrade dimmers at my house now that everything lighting is going LED. These work well. The indicator light is a nice feature and is selectable as to whether it's used or always off (nice if you install these in a bedroom).\n16#Good value, with some sacrifices. At roughly $9 bucks each these are a very good value. They dim the lights. They are no harder to install than any other switch. I've installed about a dozen in my new (used) home, both single and double pole. Cons - 1. There is a bit of delay in both on/off and the response to changes. You get used to that easily. 2. The sensitivity is not fully linear, nor particularly good. Controlling the dim at a specific level other than min and max takes some effort. The above mentioned delay does not help. 3. One of my switches does have a slight buzz to it - this switch serves 320 watts of incandescent bulb in an archaic light bar in my master bath. A trivial annoyance. 4. A couple of my switches have a bit of flickering at certain levels of brightness. One example is my pantry. Not a problem as this is a min/max application - min for late night snack searches. max otherwise. 5. I'm not particularly fond of the tiny white lights, but that's just my opinion. Notes - 1. I can't address whether the minor buzz or flickering is a result of cheap/defective switch or the nature of the load. 2. There is a very simple method of assigning the minimum dim level. Use it. Otherwise you will often find the lights appear 'off' when they are in fact 'on' but the minimum dim level does not illuminate them. Conclusion - Installing $30+ name brands would have cost me about $400. This job cost me about 1/4 that. I'll probably replace a couple of mine with higher quality switches where it matters. The master bath and dining room are are good examples. The rest serve their purpose quite well and are a bargain.\n17#Missing Dimmers. The package comes but with some of the dimmers doesn't come\n18#Bought all ten but so far installed 2 and they both buzzing very loud. I bought ten of these switches for renovate my house but my project delayed and now I found two installed so far are bad and too late for return. First I thought it could be my 125 amp breaker for my sub panel was bad because it make the buzzing noise (kind of disturbing, you can hear the noise clearly even the ceiling fan is on). So I replace my 125 amp breaker. But, it didn't fix the problem. I then turn off both first dimmer switches that I installed, then the buzzing noise stopped at the dimmer switches and the breaker. It's very much the dimmer is defected. Another issue is when you turn the dimmer low, the light started flickering and very disturbing. Now I am stuck with eight more dimmer switches which are useless. Should I waste my time to try out the rest of dimmer switches? More likely they all bad.\n19#Disgraceful. There were three missing, two without boxes, one was black for some god forsaken reason, 2 were missing the plate covers, one was missing the wires. This is a disgraceful way to do business.\n20#Junk. Falls apart\n21#definitely do not buy these dimmers, you will replace asap. very poor quality all around. 1. the screw lugs collapse into body of switch and make install difficult/impossible unless you invert switch upside down. 2. even well under capacity ( 300w for LED's) the switches cause flickering in their circuit AND FLICKERING/DROPOUTS OTHER CIRCUITS on different breakers/light switches that have this same dimmer. Unacceptable no matter how inexpensive they are. We installed 10 of these dimmers and have to replace them all, as the lighting setup was a disaster. 3. the dimmers make a very noticeable and distracting noise when in use ( high pitched constant electrical hum) that is not acceptable. do not buy.\n22#To loud. Bad quality of dimmer switch! Very loud!\n23#Some of them don't work. I bought 2 sets of these dimmers for a new construction and 5 of them don't work :( The ones that work look great.\n24#Not for LEDs. Tired on many different LED types and load always flickers\n25#Excellent Product and High Quality. I have purchased over 20 of these for my house after installing and upgrading all my of interior lights to LED. These switches are excellent quality and preform very well. You can use this in single pole applications or for 3 way switches. If you're not familiar with 110v don't worry the directions are easy to read and follow. I cannot recommend these enough.\n26#Flickering. I really would have liked to like these. Everything about them seemed like they would be good quality. After installing several, I noticed lights starting to flicker. I thought it was the bulbs, so I changed the bulbs. Still flickering. Changed the dimmer with a dimmer from home depot and lights stopped flickering. Now going to replace all of these. 😔\n27#Fast delivery of the Product. Good quality.\n28#Dimmable switches not working, creaky noisy. Dimmable switches are not working properly, my electrician tried couple of times, finally he brought from homedepo and replaced, but unfortunately my return window got expired. It’s waste of money 93$\n29#Good quality. A little smaller profile more room in the Electrical Box\n30#DO NOT BUY THESE - THEY ARE POORLY MADE AND FAIL. These dimmer switches are so poorly made. They literally fall apart after installation. The screws do not stay set so the lights frequently flicker and eventually lose connection. I attempted to install these and had 2 electricians after me install them and they failed every time. The dimmer levers failed on 3 or 4 of the 20 I purchased so far. Do not buy these switches, go with Lutron or something else.\n31#Cheap dimmers but great customer service. These certainly aren't Lutron quality, but they got the job done. Only 8 of them worked but they were so cheap I still saved money. Update: Since I wrote this review three more of these dimmers have failed on regular dimmable LED lights. However, after the first review three seller offers me a no questions asked refund. They replaced the cost within two days. I was impressed. I will give them another shot down the road when they improved their product.\n32#Great dimmers! These dimmers are great! I have installed them all over the house and have not had a single issue with them. I like that the locator light can be turned off. I have the locator lights turned on in hallways and living spaces, but keep them turned off for bedrooms. The electrical connections are my preferred design where a two straight conductors can be inserted and the internal clamp holds onto them. The line and load terminals take 2 conductors. The ground terminal only takes one conductor. It supports installation in a three-way circuit.\n33#Would not recommend DANGEROUS!!! I had specifically purchased wi- fi enabled to connect with new Led lights for my basement by a licensed electrician and these buzz every time they are turned on after a month they stopped working I would never recommend this brand nothing but problems there customer service is terrible!!👎👎👎\n34#Company great at helpful responses. They look good, I had a bit of trouble with the setting and flickering. I wrote an original review, telling of problems. Amazing this company wrote to me, through Amazon which gave none of my personal information, . This company has stayed in touch, making sure I am happy with the product and helping with installation! I’ve never over many, many years & items, had a company that, stuck with me and helped so very much! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO YOU AND ANYONE, THAT NEED LIGHTING PRODUCTS !\n35#Works for short time. Worked well for few months now switches failing\n36#Great value. I installed these on a small condo renovation. I was surprised how well they work. The little light in the switch is great at finding the switch at night.\n37#Not LED comparable. Bought a 10 pack. 4 of first 5 created a buzzing noise after installed. Not LED compatible. Had to then uninstall to return for refund. Waste of my time.\n38#Functional dimming switch. This is a standard installation and for the most part works well. It might be my imagination but the brightness may vary depending on how many lights are on that circuit. I would recommend these switches but the better ones cost more.\n39#Bad quality. Our many switches got bad in a month of use. Please don’t buy this\n40#Great dimmer switch for the money! We remodeled the rent house. These are great dimmer switches. The price was definitely cheaper than a lot of them on the market and worked really well.\n41#Not compatible. They did not work with my LED recessed lights. All the lights did was flicker.\n42#Very satisfied. Very satisfied\n43#Lights Flicker and Switch Buzzes. The light fixtures flicker when the dimmer setting is anywhere below 100%. All the switches have a buzzing sound when turned on, some louder than others. Poor product.\n44#Dimmers work great for LED lights, but don't always work for other lights. I have replaced a number of our dimmers with these and they work great for applications where the lights are all LED, but if they're not all LED, the dimmer and lights don't always function as intended.\n45#They’ve all worked so far! I bought a different brand for my last house and out of the 10 pack, 4 were bad. But, it was still cheaper than buying 6 better ones. I bought these for our new house assuming the same thing (that at least a few would fail), but none have been bad! They’re easy to install, especially not having to wire a neutral. I use them with LEDs and I haven’t had any issues with flickering (once you set the min brightness). Since none failed, I guess some family members might get extra holiday presents.\n46#Work good. Work good and cheaper then the name brand\n47#Cheap Price but Cheaper Quality. Trying to avoid the $22-$30 dimmers at big box stores and this dimmer is not the answer. The dimmer comes with the fragile/decora faceplate that comes off and is problematic. At this price point, it should be a simple dimmer. The actuator created difficulty for us, turning the switch on and off to test after install and it wouldn’t work. Troubleshooting instructions weren’t useful and we are licensed electricians.",
