These switches are overrated. The switch mechanisms break with minimal pressure. If you have to put them into some tight areas and have wires or materials putting slight pressure on the sides of the switch case, the switch will stop sliding and break. I’ve installed many dozens of these switches and the design is not as good as the ratings would have you believe. Another big problems is the slider does not slide all the way to the end of the switch, which is not intuitive and makes people wonder if they are working correctly. The manufacturer needs to fix these obvious problems and if they did then I would use and recommend these more often.\n1#Not matte black. It is NOT MATTE BLACK. The picture looks deceivingly matte\n2#Dims LED with aplomb. Knockoff cheap version failed horribly and is too cheap to send back. Works perfectly, unlike the cheaper version with a blue light in it. This one dims my LED fixture without flickering down to the lowest levels. Cheaper version, although \"digital\" on the package failed miserably at dimming the light, it flickered at every setting but the brightest. Buy Leviton and buy once. I won't try cheapo again in switches.\n3#Replace an outdated dimmer switch that was just turning our dimmable LED bulbs on and off. I bought this to replace an outdated dimmer switch that was just turning our new dimmable LED bulbs on and off. Since installing the \"Leviton Sureslide,\" they are now fully dimmable. The switch features a slider and a main switch, allowing you to set a predetermined brightness when turning it on and easily adjust the brightness as needed. Note to self and prospective buyers: Make sure to pick up a matching faceplate.\n4#Excellent! We purchased many of these for the house we just bought. It needed a little makeover, and these dimmer switches are an excellent addition to adjust lighting to create the right ambiance. We like the larger lever. The ones in the main stores only have the tiny little lever on the side. Our handyman likes them; \"easy install\". The quality is outstanding, Absolutely recommend!\n5#No flicker whatsoever. In my experience, not many dimmer switches can function without some flicker to your LED bulbs. This one operates six 40 w bulbs and will dim down to the brightness of a Firefly without any flicker. This is the switch if you're looking for that.\n6#Perfect. Does the job . No complaints. Good quality\n7#3 Way dimmer with 3 wire setup. 3 Way dimmer works great. Only took a few mins to install with a 3 wire system. I already had a 3 way switch installed, so I simply removed it and replaced it with this 3 way dimmer switch.\n8#Artículo incompleto. Artículo incompleto\n9#Highly recommend. Ease of installation, versatility, ...\n10#Flickers with led lights. Well I expected better from this company but it too flickers does anyone make a switch that actually works with led lights this is a joke $20 switch and it doesn’t work!\n11#Works great. Smooth, even dimming with dimmable LED lights and no flickering. I bought this Leviton, SureSlide dimmer switch after trying, and later returning, a cheaper brand (BESTTEN). The cheaper brand did dim the lights, but it was not gradual at all. It was either on full brightness, or very dim, with nothing in the middle. And at the point it made the transition from bright to dim the light would flicker badly. At first I thought I just got a bad one, but I had two of them so tried the second one with the same unsatisfactory results. So back they went. The Leviton was $3 more, but well worth it. It dims the lights gradually and smoothly, with zero flickering. Great product. Shouldn't have wasted my time trying to save a few bucks with the cheaper ones.\n12#Great dimmer for movie room. Great product - easy to install. Now we can dim the lights in the movie room with ease!\n13#Thank you!!! Thank you!!!\n14#It did not work. It did not work. Electrician threw it out and replaced it. Not worth the time to send it back.\n15#Has a mind of its own. I sit on a roll with it at the lowest dimness, next thing you know. It’s now bright and the dimmer switch has not moved. Also when at a middle dimness it flickers. Reason for purchasing is because the switch/Dimmer matched the require light switch I have next to it. To band I don’t get to decide the brightness of the light.\n16#Great Dimmer Switch. Works great\n17#work perfectly. Installed 3 of these at home and they work perfectly.\n18#Good for old work boxes where depth is an issue. Tried multiple dimmer switches and they were all too deep to fit an old work box. This one fits well and was easy to install.\n19#The best dimmer for the price. Easy to install works great\n20#simple to wire. no problems simple switch\n21#Great dimmer good price. Second one of these I have installed. Great brightness control with dimmable LED bulbs.\n22#Easy to install. Exactly what we wanted and works great!\n23#Good entry level dimmer. Good value . Very easy for a novice to install\n24#This dimmer does not fully dim. Compared to Lutron, this product does not dim all the way down. If that is a concern, this is not the product for you.\n25#Great Dimmer. Great dimmer for my application of controlling an LED outside light from just inside. Simple & straight forward. No issues.\n26#Worth the price. It was easy to instal and works fine. Half the price of the ones at Home Depot\n27#You only get the switch, no faceplate. Does not come with black faceplate - you must purchase separately... frustrating\n28#Leviton SureSlie. Works perfectly with newer style LED lights when set to the LED setting (on top of switch). Feels like a quality product when using, looks sleek...will definitely be buying more to replace older style knob type dimmers. Worth every cent!\n29#Love them. Love these! Sleek and simple. I ordered 2 and they're very functional. They look great with the right cover on them. Don't go cheap with the cover and you'll be pleased.\n30#Meh. The dimmer doesn't dim as much as I would like. Perhaps, because it's wired to led lights. It's ok, but doesn't dim enough for having a nice dinner under the ceiling light.\n31#Beware faulty after 3 months!!! The dimmer started to be faulty after 3 months! Could have started a fire!\n32#How to install it . Liked it , used on one wall\n33#Chrome Mirror Company black. this switch works well on the black Chrome Mirror Company 24''X30'' lighted vanity mirror with 40w equivalent dimmable LED bulbs.\n34#Dimmer. Works great\n35#Quick ship. Works great\n36#Great switch. Looks good works good .\n37#Highly recommend. Works great and looks great\n38#what my husband needed. we put different bulbs in our lighting fixtures and they were fluttering, now they aren't. This works well with the LED\n39#Lights, action! We didn’t want a white slide light switch on our charcoal wall. We have had no problem with this switch.\n40#Nice switch. Like the way it operates. Nice switch. Like the way it operates. Unique but intuitive.\n41#Five Stars. Works great. Easy hook up.\n42#Does not have a very good range of dimming. Does not have a very good range of dimming. Will not take the brightness down to almost nothing or off completely.\n43#Works as advertised with LEDs. Works as advertised with LEDs. Haven't tried CFLs. Would've been a little better with an illuminated switch, but I knew that going in. Note to DIYers: Don't forget to order the wall plate. I did! (And I just noticed the text \"wall plate not included\" in the product description.) Oh well!\n44#Excellent switch for led bulbs. Excellent switch for LED bulbs. It has a capacitor (or something similar) that dampens a change in current going through it. When you adjust the slider, the change in brightness has a soft ramp up time (very short but noticable). This means that small spikes in current going to the bulbs is soften eliminating flickering. Works well. You can make fine tuning adjustments on brightness all the way down to very dim, just barely on. Still, the dimmest setting should meet almost any low level lighting needs. Be aware that it doesn't feel like an expensive switch, which it isn't but I feel it does an excellent job at it's price point.\n45#Perfect for our use. Perfect for our use. Slide control works great and is steady and smooth. The lower switch allows you to set the level of dimming and keep it there when you turn it off and on again.\n46#... room setup (two separate doors into the bathroom) I like this dimmer a lot. Once I figured out the wiring for a two switch room setup (two separate doors into the bathroom) I like this dimmer a lot. Very smooth operation and clean design. Dim is night light dim to full power. Quiet on/off switch. I have it operating three LED bulbs on pendants and no buzzing at all like you sometimes get with LEDs on dimmers.\n47#One Star. Didn't work sent back for refund\n48#Four Stars. Smooth nice",
