Works great. Nice to have the ability to switch the light on/off without going to the wall.\n1#Nice product! Very nice! Worked as intended. Easy installation. Would recommend it!\n2#Great switch. Used for lights in our garden Very easy to use and program.\n3#Easy. Easy to install and a great way to control lighting. I put it on a light on the back of shed in back yard and switch it from in the house. Works great.\n4#Very good product. I have installed several of these in both single and three-way light switches. This was to correct a very inconvenient switch layout in a new house. So far, they have performed perfectly and I have yet to change out a battery on the transmitter. You will need to have a neutral at the switch location, also to convert a three way, you will need to convert it to a normal single switch configuration (i. e., trace out the hot leg and the wire to the light and put the relay in this location). Other than that, the installation is very straightforward. It is a far better solution than pulling new wires to create a three way in a new location, since one relay can have up to eight switches (according to the manufacturer). I wouldn’t recommend it for any application except lighting as I don’t know what is the quality of the relay, nor how many switchings it will do in normal life expectancy. The blue LED indicates that the transmitter switch is functioning, which is convenient\n5#As expected. As expected :-) Ordered more :-)\n6#Thinkbee wireless switch. The Thinkbee wireless switch was easy to install and use. I had a switch on the wrong side of the door. This made it possible to have the switch on the other side of the wall without major work and frustration. I would definitely recommend this item!!\n7#Works as described. Worked as described. It loses a star with the short wires that come with the wiring harness - makes it difficult to tie into the romex in the ceiling box..especially when the wire is a thin gauge already.\n8#Stop trying to install at the switch. I see a lot of folks asking how they can install it at the light switch itself when it's just two hot wires and a ground. Dont do that. Instead do it at the light fixture itself. Then it will seem simpler as there will only be a hot and neutral there most of the time. Also don't use the wire connectors that come with it. Even if you connect it it doesn't seem up to code to me. Buy your own wire connectors like the traditional yellow or orange. Finally I found it easier just to connect all of the neutrals together (two from the signal box, one front the fixtures, and one from the wall. Best of luck to you. Works great for me. Sidenote: it should go without saying but please turn your power off at the fuse box before installing.\n9#Very effective wireless switch. I am so much happy with the results. I have installed it on my chandelier and I can control the light from anywhere.\n10#Super easy to install and works great. Installed in 2 minutes and paired straight away. Hardest part was figuring out how to get the switch back off to screw to the wall - but figured it out eventually. Will buy more for sure.\n11#Great value. Easy to install. Works well\n12#Simple and works. Working well for several months now. Easy to install when replacing light fixture.\n13#Not what I expected. The installation hardware included was helpful and I had no issues. The brightness of the lights were unsatisfactory! I expected them to be much brighter based on the advertised pictures.\n14#Easy to use, reliable, problem solver. I now have 7 of these in my house. Each worked out of the box and has been reliable since day one. Some are now years old. My first five were used to solve a tricky problem where I cut through a wall to join two sides of a duplex on a long hall with a stairwell. The existing 3 way wired switch (bottom and top of the stairs) to control the hall lighting was not going to work and a lot of wiring was going to be needed to allow lights to be switched on and off at each end of the hall and by the rooms along the hall in addition to a switch at the bottom of the stairs. Using Thinkbee 3 ways, connected to two lights in the hall ceiling, I was able to wirelessly set up a neat and safe system that has been working with zero problems for 3 years. I just put in two more Thinkbees to upgrade a fan only switch in a bathroom to fan and light separate switches for a upgraded fan to light/fan installed without having to pull new wire up the wall and across the ceiling. Big time saver. Again, setup is very easy and these Thinkbee devices just work when installed and keep on working over time.\n15#Wonderful and helped us to have a light when there was not a switch. For a light without a switch\n16#Easy to set up. Recommend this product for its ease to set up with a minor caveat that you need to keep safety first\n17#Useful. Works Just great and its super easy to install\n18#Great remote application. Small and easy to install. Worked as described and first time!\n19#Easiest way to add a light switch without WiFi. I replaced a fan with a light fixture. The previous fan used the pull chains to turn on and off instead of a wall switch. I researched several options for adding a non WiFi switch and decided to use the Thinkbee remote switch. It was very easy to add inline between your existing electrical wires and light if you have any handyman skills (or have a contractor do it). The kit comes with 2 wire lever nuts (similar to Wagu lever nuts) that made it easy to connect all the wires. The switch synced quickly to the inline box and has been working perfectly for over a month. The remote switch appears very sturdy and works by \"clicking\" the remote. The light turns on instantly without any delay. I haven't tested how far away the remote works since I keep the remote in the same room as the light. I am very happy with the remote switch and I would buy it again.\n20#Love this switch. Bought this for some outdoor lighting around my fire pit patio. Works great from my living room to the fire pit area about 200 feet away. Easy to hook up and pair to the receiver.\n21#POS.. get something different. Finally got around to using this.. return window closed. POS. Don’t buy one. The pairing is extremely difficult, just go with a basic remote switch, not worth the hassle.\n22#Quick and easy. My initial thoughts on this is that it's a good option for lights but I bought it for a different purpose entirely which is to operate an attic fan remotely. The wires on the transmitter appear to be 16 gauge and I'm a little skeptical of its ability to control a small attic fan safely due to this although it says it's rated for 10 amps, up to1000 watts and 150v? I'll edit this review if I find it not to be the case.\n23#Did not work at all. Shipped out quick, packaged very well. Easy to follow directions. Simple install. But it didn't work. I contacted the seller and they just sent me the instructions and then said return it. I returned it and ordered a different brand. I would not recommend at all.\n24#Awesome and convenient! Super easy to install, we love this!\n25#Awesome! This was recommended by our electrician, after installing a new light in the sunroom. This room had formerly been a porch, and had three ceiling fixtures on the one switch. This light had no remote (like the old cheap light which had burned out). This was installed, and works perfectly, plus we keep the switch on at all times for whenever the other two fixtures are needed.\n26#works as described. this was an easy fix for a light that had no switch. they provide these clips vs. wire nuts, that were easy to use. the remote worked from the room entrance and quickly turns the light off/on.\n27#Great product poor instructions. I knocked one star just because I almost returned this product because I was not understanding how to install even with the picture instructions. They were not straight forward for a non electrician. One e I figured not to install on the light switch but in the lamp it worked line a charm. I suggest a you tube video link or website that shows better how to install.\n28#Excellent range. I have a detached garage about 100' from my house, that i wanted to control the outdoor flood lights on. I tried another brand prior to this one and it would barely make it to my house. This one, works great. I could go to the middle of my living room (probably 150') and it still worked. I would have given it 5 stars except the wires are extremely short making it hard to wire.\n29#Failed. Purchased in September, failed in May\n30#works, but hard to get started. put this in my parents ceiling fan to control the light, it was easy to install, and easy to control, which they like, but it was very hard to get the controller to pair with the module, the instructions were completely worthless and wrong. Basically you need to hold down the button on the module for 3 seconds until it flashes fast, then while holding it, hold down the button on the remote for a a few seconds as well, then the lamp will turn on to show its paired.\n31#Used two of these to separate light and fan control in ceiling fan. Do you have a ceiling fan and light controlled by one switch? Do you want to separate them? Two of these puppies and you can do exactly that without running more wire. In your ceiling fan, there should be the following: Hot coming in Neutral coming in Hot to light Hot to fan Neutral to fan and light I wired it so the neutral to the fan and light is connected to both controllers out, the hot to fan on one controller and the hot to the light on the other. The controllers get hot and neutral from the power coming in obviously. This will look like a mess in the box, don't get me wrong, but will allow you to have to separate stitches to the light and fan. I plan to completely bypass the wall switch and get a blank plate for it, using only these wireless switches as the switch.\n32#Awesome design & functionality. Product is very well designed & the installation process is very simple. Comes with all necessary accesories. Very small footprint for both parts.\n33#Like magic. Rain damaged my backyard pipes and cooked all my wires, which are now abandoned. Luckily, I still have remote power source to hook up to the lights but no way to switch the lights in the house 450ft away. I bought the self power version but it worked 50% of the time. And once I tug the receiver inside the electrical box (outside), it barely worked. I bought this one, add another electrical box on top of the existing just to house the receiver and it works perfectly with the switch inside the house. I even let the antenna fold inside the box. I think if I let the antenna stick outside the range could even be better. Compare this and the self power version, not sure if the improvements are from the powered switch, or the better receiver with external antenna, or both. What if using the self power switch with this type of receiver still produce the same results so we don’t have to worry about changing the switch’s battery down the line. Great product regardless.\n34#Easy to Assemble and use! I bought this for my girlfriends bathroom. Her light needed a new light switch. I am far from electrician and don't usually do anything with electricity. This was extremely simple and easy to figure out. It has worked great now for a few years. AAA Plus product.\n35#We had trouble with our garage door opener and this device made it work perfectly. Ease of use was good. Quality good connectivity. Good appearance good\n36#Works and looks nice. I decided to replace my normal switches with these. Looking online for a Manuel didn't help because all the youtube videos I found was people installing them just behind the bulb. Once I figured out which wire went where in my situation, installation was pretty easy and the pairing was easy and straightforward as well.\n37#Remote switch fits perfectly. Extremely compact design allows receiver to fit in existing canopy. Everything including clever wire connectors with the kit. Easy to install and operate!\n38#Good product. Great when you need to add a switch and can't run wires.\n39#Easy to install. Perfect for my application\n40#No funciona. Realice la instalacion como indica el manual y no funciona, en mi caso ni encendio.\n41#Requires you to wire it into your device. You need basic electrical skills. I had no issues with the installation and it worked great!\n42#Easy to use. Light for bedroom\n43#Nice Product. I got it on time. I purchased it because the former owner changed the door's opening direction but did not relocate the light switch, which is behind the door. I also did not want to hire an electrician to relocate the switch. I encountered an issue. It could be an exception to my case. The connection of the two lines that go to the bulb is matter. On my first attempt, It did not work; I swapped the two lines, and it worked. I wanted to share my experience. Another experience is buying the cover if you plan to install it in a room. It seems I have to buy a block cover to install the remote on the wall. The remote needs a battery, and although people mentioned that it may take years to change it, we need to consider this requirement. Update: I used Commands to stick the remote to the wall.\n44#WORKS AS ADVERTISED. These were easy to install and function flawlessly!!!\n45#Great remote awutcg. I added additional lights in a storage unit. I added a junction box, conduit and wire to 2 LED fixtures. By installing the receiver into the junction box the installation was neat and clean. The storage unit had a very high ceiling (14’) and the existing single light was activated by a motion sensor. Using this item I could place the on/off switch anywhere in the unit or use it as a remote to be carried in your pocket. Works great!\n46#wireless switch. took me a bit to figure out but actually pretty easy works like a charm\n47#great little remote switch. the connectors are nice but large the switch works great. using it to control our dock lights.",
