After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Four Way Multi-Location Control Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Four Way Multi-Location Control Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>.

I usually pick these up at HD but was without a vehicle for several days - Very convenient to the door order.\n2#Switch today. great switch, works as advertised, quality product\n3#Stopped working properly. Stopped working properly after a couple months. Have to flick the switch multiple times to turn light on/off\n4#Functions as expected. Great purchase. Cannot believe i was able to obtain this for $5.26 on sale. Functions as you would expect.\n5#Its a switch, so there isn't much to say ... Its a switch, so there isn't much to say about it. However, the one that we received does not toggle as smoothly as we expected so I knocked off a couple of stars for that.\n6#No Surprises. Local big box only carries 4-way switches in \"Heavy Duty\", which have a wider switch paddle that lacks the small border around the switch itself. I found this distracting, so I ordered this as a replacement. Looks much more like the other switches, so I'm quite satisfied.\n7#Five Stars. Works fine.\n8#Four Stars. Just what I needed\n9#Great multi switch. It is hard to get excited about a light switch but this one I did. I have upstairs hall lights that are controlled by four switches. We repainted the house and the old switch was filthy from years of dirty hands and I decided to replace it- bad idea. I pulled the switch and went to the local hardware store and got switches that looked like it but the lights were no longer controlled by all the switches. I finally found this one on amazon and it has worked perfectly. It is easy to install especially if you are replacing a switch that was already there.\n10#4-Way Switch. Good product. Good quality.\n11#Five Stars. Worked perfectly. No issues.\n12#Good Product, Received Quickly. I received the switch in the mail very quickly, installed it and it works just fine.\n13#Four Stars. Couldn't find the switch I needed at the big chain stores. Amazon to the rescue.\n14#Works great and much cheaper than our local big box. This switch works great and was much cheaper than our local big box. note: It is a little wider than the typical standard switch.\n15#4-way toggle switch. has all the terminals, meets CSA, even has a ground screw. This is a white toggle, the body is ivory, but you won't see that with cover plate on.\n16#Beats the big-box stores. Product was brand new and genuine brand name. Saved $5 each over the big box store. They are installed and working great.\n17#Works great! Easy to put on and works 100% fine no issues at all. Will buy more for the other bedrooms in this house.\n18#Great value. This item is a great value. Item was as advertised. It was shipped and received very quickly. i would order it again if I needed another.\n19#Good quality. Satisfied with the quality.\n20#May take sometime. Good product. Poor delivery.",
