I ordered as the EU rocker type switches look more contemporary and are easier to clean. However this one has the vendor name stamped into the plate, which will collect oil/dirt/etc. So does not fulfil the mission.\n1#Very solid feel!! Defiantly a difference in the solid feel of this switch compared to the home builder type switches. I choose this more expensive type for the kitchen switch since is is used the most in our home. Very solid feel!!\n2#Quiet, yes. Silent, no. Bought to replace a fairly loud click rocker switch. It is definitely quieter with less of a \"click\", but it is by no means silent. Haven't found a silent one of this type.\n3#Great replacements for high use. Great. Solid action. Much heavier 76g than residential-grade 47g. Should last more than the ~10k cycles of res (sloppy switches open up at ends).\n4#Thebest. Works great\n5#Leviton switich very quiet. I saw these on sale and am currently changing to these Decora switches. These are first quality switches and work perfectly. saved me a trip out to get some.\n6#Good switch. The switch is good, but it feels weird when you turn the light off or on. It doesn’t click, the switch is soft. Weird feeling but works fine\n7#Switched out the light switch. Leviton light switch was changed out for Legrand light switch.\n8#Expected more... The switch installs and works OK. But I expected more in quality and looks. There is no distinct \"click\" when you switch on/off. The sound is more of a dead cat hitting dirt. There is no feedback from the switch to your fingers telling you that it engaged. The color is a shadow of \"white\" but not entirely white.\n9#Quiet and simple to install. The only negative thing I can say about the switches is turning them off. Sometimes when I press off it does not actually move the switch. These require a nice firm press. I leave it up to you to decide whether or not that is a positive.\n10#High quality switch. Solid function and contact. Our bathroom lights were occasionally flickering, and the “builder’s choice” cheap wall switch turned out to be the cause. No more flickering with this switch. I had always thought any switch was good enough, but I was wrong.\n11#We are OFF Leviton Switches. Love the brand, love the switch plate and outlet covers, BUT **not** the switches. Someone at the company had the idea of adding the brand to the front of the switches As a result, not only do you lose the clean look and feel of a Decora-style switch, embossed / debossed branding letters collect dirt. This is a big issue, and moreover they are not easy to clean. Very unfortunate; we searched everywhere for a place that carried clean Leviton switches but all seem to be branded now. 1. They collect dirt and grime 2. Not easy to clean once handled 3. No longer present a clean look 4. Do not match other switches on the property Posting this both to share our experience (marks were unexpected), and as a constructive comment -- hoping for a change in the future :)\n12#Not a quiet switch at all, twice as loud as residential version. Replaced a \"residential grade\" leviton switch with this commercial one. Construction is significantly better, however, it is far from quiet. It is a loud click, much louder than the residential one (which I would consider quiet). Per photo attached: Leviton Commercial switch click is 71.7 decibels, Leviton Residential is 60.3 decibels - at 8 inches away from switch. This 10db difference translates into 2 times louder! I double checked the product number 5691-2W and it matches the product listing. I bought two of these, and both are the same click volume. It's in a bedroom, which makes the click more annoying. Will likely end up returning these.\n13#On/Off. Simple, modern-looking and functional. I wanted to replace the old style on/off switch to my office and chose this switch. This is a simple on/off switch (not a dimmer switch) which was exactly as I needed. Instructions were well written and the switch is performing as expected. I would buy this again the next time I need another switch.\n14#3way Rocker switch. Very happy. Easy to install. It is a three-way rocker switch. Has a nice little light when off. Didn’t know that was included. Nice extra to have specially for my kids.\n15#Substantial Upgrade From Residential Switch. The construction of these switches is significantly beefier than the common residential rated switches most homes have, or home centers sell. Everything from the contacts, to the frame is heavy duty. There is no clicking sound when using.\n16#Great line. Great product\n17#Working OK. Color is a little off from Luton switch\n18#Works Perfectly. Bought this to match my Decora smart switches in the same gang plate. Perfect match, looks just like all other others and works great.\n19#Requires a specific orientation! Leviton decided to mold in their name on the switch, unlike their previous versions. This requires you to put it in a specific orientation to not look weird. It is a completely unnecessary addition and costs time if you do not catch this before install and may not work if you want to match the opposite orientation because you cannot pop out the rocker plate. I have an upside down configuration and returned this because I did not want a noticeable upside down leviton marking on the switch beside another one that is down.\n20#Relatively quiet click. I was mainly looking for a switch that has a quiet click, to expensive and this one checks out. There still is a click but way less obnoxious than all other cheap ones I've tried.\n21#Good upgrade from residential grade. I am downgrading my review. Upon reordering this product I received a Legrand switch (not the correct product) in a correctly labeled Leviton box -- clearly fraud in the fulfillment process\n22#Simple On/Off Switch. This is a simple 2-way switch. It works as claimed.\n23#So Nice. Bought this for my Kitchen light switch & love it. Easy to install.\n24#Nice Quality. Good switch.\n25#Made for back wiring - don’t remove the screws! I have old wiring in my home and I removed the screws from the switch to use the same loops already on my electrical wires. Don’t do that. I had to throw away the switch because the screws do not go back in. As long as you wire it as designed it should be fine.\n26#Good switches. Good switch but too costly. Have several that are 25+ years old that have never had a problem\n27#Works great! Feels a bit more better quality than cheaper ones. Has a more “softer”, solid sounding click when you switch it on and off which makes it seem better quality, if that makes sense.\n28#This is a 2-way (duplex) switch... ...meant to control a circuit that energizes a light or receptacle from this switch only, as opposed to a 3-way, which typically controls lighting from two locations, usually opposite walls in a kitchen. Be sure you know what you are doing, and if not, either hire a licensed electrician or take the time to watch an instructional video on YouTube. KILL THE CIRCUIT AT THE BREAKER before opening up any electrical switch or outlet on that circuit!! Once open, test ALL the wiring for the presence of electricity. If you plan to do more that a couple of these kinds of jobs, buy the typical test equipment found here on Amazon (receptacle and non-contact voltage tester).\n29#Quality Product! Would buy again.\n30#Nice, Affordable Switch. OK - This is a typical, high-quality Leviton item, which we expect to last as long as the house. It mounts easy, looks great and is easy to use. Contrary to what we originally thought, this item is not lighted, but that's not critical for our application. The switch has a softer, quieter feature, which means it's silent when you turn it on or off. If you're used to a more positive click feel and sound from a light switch, this one is different. This is a typical SPST switch, but one downside is that it only accommodates one wire per connection. So for circuits with two feed wires, this means you will have to either double up on the screw terminal or use one push-in and the other wound on the screw. If they simply would've provided two push in connections for each terminal, it would've been much more convenient.\n31#A logo on the front? Are you serious?? I've been buying Levithon for a decade. Why would they begin stamping their logo on the face? So much for a modern and clean look. I will start using Eaton products from now on and will never buy another Levithon. You lost a long time customer with this nonsense\n32#As advertised. Nice sleek looking switch, easy to install.\n33#Should have returned. I still may return. Product name on switch is to big and looks terrible. Switch is OK otherwise.\n34#Leviton 5691 - 2! 15 Amp Deccora Plus Rocker Single Pole. Works as advertised. Excellent Rocker Single Pole Switch and very Quiet.\n35#Works great. This was just what needed for installing a new light fixture\n36#Embossed logo is just annoying. I have always liked these switches and have bought many in the past. However, now Leviton have embossed their name on the face it really takes away from the clean lines of the switch. Very unnecessary and now I am going to look at alternatives.\n37#A very QUIET wall switch. Extremely quiet switch. If you don’t like the clicking sound that model 5601 make, then buy these. They cost more but in my book are worth it to me. A very solid heavy duty QUIET wall switch.\n38#Nice quality. Definitely worth it to get the commercial grade, noticeable difference in the quality of the switch. Very happy with it\n39#Five Stars. Great switch.\n40#Two Stars. Cheaper quality than the Leviton switches I installed ten years ago.\n41#Be very careful!, I got about 20 of ... Be very careful!, I got about 20 of these to replace all my old switches in my house. if you unscrew the screws all the way, they are almost impossible to thread back into the nut that freely moves in the switch... I've trashed 4 so far because i backed the screw out too far then lost the nut inside of the switch.\n42#Works great, doesn't feel great. Works perfectly, but doesn't have a great \"click.\" Little bit more mushy than I would like.\n43#Safe and stylish. Top notch products!\n44#Four Stars. THANKS - received quickly and it was exactly as described and expected\n45#Five Stars. Neat product. Installed in my bathroom and is working as designed.\n46#A nice product. Works like it should. Easy to install.\n47#Five Stars. Just what I needed",
