Worked for our new led ceiling lights.\n1#Not new. Damaged/missing packing and no instructions. Switches work fine, but this was a open-box returned item. The box was damaged, one of the switches was missing its wrapper and the instructions were missing. I would have returned them except I needed to use them right away.\n2#You get what you pay for. I, like many others bought this because of the price. I am sure you found this switch because of how much cheaper it is compared to other switches that do the same thing. I will be returning this item because it just worries me too much, and that is something I never had to do before. As an electrician I just do not feel comfortable using this product. 1. You can just feel the difference in quality between this switch and any other rocker switch. It weighs close to nothing and feels cheap 2. The rocker switch has no resistance when you push it and feels mushy 3. It doesn’t snap like a normal switch to on/off. You can actually very easily put it in between on/off and that really worries me 4. The switch is only rated to 6amps. I need it to control LED lights and even with LEDs it doesn’t take much to overload that 5. It isn’t UL listed, it is ETL listed but any quality products are almost always UL listed in the US\n3#Dimming Range is Very Poor. This switch only dims to about 40- 50%. Much less low end than the cheap switch I was using previously. I am also getting lots of fluctuation in the dimming, which I can't be positive is coming from the switch but wasn't happening with the previous switch so it appears to be.\n4#Poor dimming. Had to return. They dimmed the lights, but only barely, maybe from 100% to 75%. Not really dim, just a little less than full brightness.\n5#Didn't Do what I wanted it to. Bought this switch because of the price and I needed 3 of them. It doesn't take up as much room in the J-box as other dimmers, and it is a 0-10v (5 wires to the fixture) design, but it only turned the fixture down about 10%. That wasn't nearly enough. I tried another brand and I got the 75-80% decrease that I needed. So this one works, but not well enough.\n6#Super Switches. I purchase these switches for use on LED panels and strip lighting for client projects. They are easy to install and the slide function is very smooth. The paddle switch has a good positive feel when switching on and off.\n7#Perfect Switch. I used this switch to create a light wall for my wife. The 0-10 dimmer worked as it should. Easy install and easy to read instructions.\n8#Don’t purchase. Ordered 3 packs of two. Out of the 6 switches only 3 worked A 50% failure rate is not acceptable.\n9#good deal. worked great for the price\n10#All around good 0-10v dimmer. I don't write a lot of reviews, but I feel these dimmers have earned it. I don't know why so many 0-10v dimmers are so expensive, there's not that much going on inside them. These work well and are priced where I would expect them to be. I had the other less expensive ones you see more often, and these are way better for the look, feel and function. These have only one adjustment for minimum brightness, the other brands had adjustments for both min and max.",
