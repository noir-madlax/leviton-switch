I like the way this glows in the dark (when it is in the off position). We're using it in our attic.\n1#Good Light Switch for dim Light. Nice light switch to differentiate from another light switch in dim light situations\n2#Light lasted 3.5 years. Good switch, does what it says it does, light inside sadly died after 3.5 years. Switch still works but now it's just a regular switch without light.\n3#Junk...Don't bother trying... Illumination is all but impossible to see. I won't even bother with a drive to kohls to return it.\n4#Very well-made light switch. This switch is a lot better made than the ones you find at the hardware store. Would buy again.\n5#Works fine. Works fine, standard installation, the illuminated switch can be useful in a dark room at night.\n6#Perfect for my garage at night! Easy to install and easy to see in the dark!\n7#Works Great! This work great for our property that had a dark foyer without a light switch nearby. This switch lights up just enough so you can see it in the dark to turn the light on.\n8#Almost perfect. I like the brightness of the light. Some say it is too dim. They are missing the purpose. It is not intended to light up an area. It is intended to make it easy to see the switch in a dark room. It does that very well. It glows amber around the switch so you can see it easily. Installation was easy. The posts are offset. Commonly, you have both wires attach on the same side of a switch. On this, they are on opposite sides of the switch. But, that doesn't make it more difficult to install. If you don't know what you are doing, I strongly suggest getting a qualified electrician to install it. Electricity is dangerous. The problem I have is that this switch leaks. I use LED lights. They have a capacitor leading into the AC to DC circuit. The tiny bit of power leaking into the line charges up the capacitor. When it is charged, it quickly discharges and the LED light blinks. So, my lights blink, very quickly, about once a second. I grounded the switch to see if that would help. It didn't. I can get different lights, but I would rather have a switch that doesn't leak.\n9#Dim. I expected the toggle switch itself to be lit like ones Iâ€™ve had before. There is only a tiny dot of light behind the switch. Very dim.\n10#Awsome. Works good I replaced old one\n11#The lit up part is around the switch stalk not in it. My switch was arcing inside, I decided to get a 15 amp rated switch in case the lights it operated were drawing more power than the single light we had changed to a bank of 3. I felt getting that higher amperage rate would be better. Fitted and the arcing has gone. Previously I had a switch that lit up the switch stalk, this one is lit up around the stalk base. I don't really mind it's lit and the dark hallway has that point of light to navigate by, without having to turn on all the lights at night.\n12#It Works. The night light is a good feature. At first I felt it was too dim. It could be brighter for the utility room and den. But in the bedroom I wouldn't want it any brighter. Works well so far. EZ install. Good quality. The white matched the existing plate cover. It is the same brand as the previous switch.\n13#brightness. I found exactly what I needed at an affordable price, and the delivery was quick.\n14#not all that bright, but you can see it in the dark. installed in my shop that has no windows..very easy to see\n15#Dim light. Doesnâ€™t illuminate very well\n16#Just what I needed. I have a bedroom switch in an odd place on the wall and have difficulty finding it in the dark. Well, no more. A flathead screwdriver and some needle-nose pliers and in about ten minutes I had that puppy installed (Don't forget to turn off the power at the circuit breaker). Not a night light. Just bright enough to easily find it easily in the dark. And a good price.ðŸ™‚\n17#Worked perfectly, slightly dim. This was easy to install. The existing switch was ungrounded and this one worked without grounding and fit a standard switchplate. It controls 4 shoplights (Two 4 ft LED tubes in each) with no flickering. The neon bulb is a bit dim, especially from the side, that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.\n18#Good value, it works. Good purchase. No issues\n19#Lights up the darkness. Best thing we could have ever done.\n20#Works without a ground wire! Now I can turn on my awkwardly place garage light switch without feeling around for the switch!\n21#It has one job! It had one job. Turn lights on and off. Switch failed after 10 months.\n22#Not very bright. I found this switch somewhat disappointing. My switch-plate fits the switch pretty closely and the lighted switch light barely shows around the switch. I may try enlarging the hole in the switch-plate, but this didn't meet my expectations. I cannot recommend this.\n23#Neon bulb as light may flicker in off position when used on LED lights. Neon bulb as light may flicker in off position when used on LED lights. Fine for fluorescent or incandescent.\n24#Light is not very bright. Dim uneven light and it pulses / Flickers.\n25#Fror that really dark room. Really an amazing toggle switch that is not overly bright but just the perfect amount of brightness.\n26#Cheaper & Better than local Big Box Store. Amazon saves me $$$ in gas. Surrounded by big box hardware stores that sell cheap Chinese electrics. Bought this at Amazon, shipped to my door, installed in minutes - No mess, no stress.\n27#Does the jpb. It is just as advertised.\n28#Controlled lights flicker when off. Light controlled by this switch would flicker when off (not talking about the switch itself, that works fine and lights up when switch is off). Simple, standard, 120v single pole light switch to one LED light. Shouldn't happen. Poor/no directions written on box so you have to destroy box to see the poor directions.\n29#Not good for LED. Was working okay on the fluorescent bulbs with total power 160 Watts. Yesterday installed LED 46 Watts light panel. Panel is flickering in darkness when light is off, switch is blinking when off.\n30#Exactly what I needed. Installed in the hallway by my front door to better find the switch when entering at night. The soft dim glow works perfectly to guide me just as desired. Easy to install. Very satisfied.\n31#Works as advertised. Wish the light was a little brighter but went from zero darkness to instant switch location. Easy to install\n32#Nice. Works very well. I installed it in the dark room that made it to be located easy.\n33#Very dim. I have had lighted switches before that were much brighter. If you want a soft lit switch, this would be the one for you. Standard size and went in easily; easy to install.\n34#Not too bright for bedroom. Wanted a lighted switch for the bathroom. This one works OK. Not too bright that it is blinding, or lighting up the room. But enough light that the grandkids can find it sure enough.\n35#Meh. Not what I had in mind\n36#Fine product, works as expected. I like the product but installation was a little sketchy, I thought it would be more straight-forward to replace my existing single-pole switch. But this new one doesn't provide clear markings as to line vs load, and instructions were almost non-existent. Probably a slam-dunk for an electrician, but I'm a novice homeowner. Once installed it works just fine.\n37#Nice back-lit light switch. Very nice amount of light at the sides/top of the toggle switch, coming from behind the toggle switch. Works fine with the LED bulbs on this line, no flickering. Needed a reference point during dark hours to avoid the wall end area, and this is just enough light at the light switch toggle area only, for reference/distances purposes. The toggle itself is white, but the light transmits thru the clear plastic framing the toggle itself. (Legrand Seymour single pole lighted toggle 15A light switch).\n38#Works, but wish it was a little brighter. Works, but wish it was a little brighter.\n39#leaky. I bought 10 of these, and about half of them, when in the off position, leak a little current, intermittently. This is a real problem for bedroom lights, which visibly strobe at night\n40#Works perfectly. Worked exactly as described. Lights nicely in the dark.\n41#Convenient. Great safety feature and easy to install\n42#Good light switch. Good light switch\n43#Nice and solid switch. This switch was bought to replace one in our master bath. The old one became loose and floppy. This one is easy to toggle and yet it feels solid. The only thing I wish I had noticed is that it's metal colored. Our faceplate is white. So the switch has a line of silver/chrome color around it. But it doesn't look bad at all. Had I noticed I'd have bought a white one. I am very happy with this one, though.\n44#Awesome Purchase. Awesome Purchase\n45#Illumination is not significant. I am comparing this to a transparent plastic illuminated switch that I also use, and find this one much less noticeable when illuminated. Not bright enough.\n46#Fit issues due to the raised area around the switch. I would search for a different brand if I could do over. The body of the switch have a raised rectangular area around the switch. This causes the switch plate cover to not sit flat.\n47#Dim light. I am disappointed that the light portion of the switch is so dim. The quality of the switch seems to be just fine.\n48#Good switch. Good switch, love how it lights up. No complaints. Uodate. My ceiling light has a very weak, fast flash with this switch. House has two wire wiring, no ground included. What's wrong here?",
