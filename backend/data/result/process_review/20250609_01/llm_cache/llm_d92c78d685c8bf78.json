Works great. Easy connections. Instructions were good once you find the Hot Wire.\n1#If the switch hasn't dies yet just wait it will. These are all defective junk. I've had multiple that fail and replacements fail too. You are on borrowed time. I should have paid more in the first place for better quality but live and learn.\n2#Good quality. Very easy to wire up and is very good looking and works amazing with Alexa.\n3#If you are using LEDs beware this dimmer cannot handle even 50 watts of LED bulbs. The features are good, it was easy to setup. I had an electrician wire this up, so I cant say on complexity I know that was a complaint of everyone else. My biggest issue is that with a 6 light chandelier with 6 8 watt LED bulbs, the dimmer will shut off at max brightness due to overloading, even though this is only a quarter of the wattage the dimmer says it can support. I will be searching for a smart dimmer with a higher load capability as this one cannot handle it. Its also past my return date.\n4#Won't work without a neutral. BEWARE - your switch box must have a neutral wire. This should be made more clear. Most homes wired prior to 2000 do not. New construction electrical codes now require a neutral in switch boxes.\n5#Wouldn't work with my wiring for some reason... I had my electrician install this once, but it didn't work despite correct wiring and the neutral wire. I got the switch replaced and had the same problem despite the same issues. The lights we want to control are WELL below 150W (maximum for LED dimmable lights) and it doesn't seem to switch them on/off. The lights we have are 72W total, 12W per dimmable light. We contacted support but they were no help either.\n6#Lights won’t dim. My dimmable lights don’t completely shut off unless I pull out that little piece of plastic at the bottom. It’s like a clip so this Alexa compatible dimmer is useless since I need to get up to pull out and push in that little clip. Will be returning\n7#NOT WORKING WITH ALEXA IN MEXICO. This switch not working with alexa in mexico\n8#Not so good. I’ve had these all of three days functioning and the lights flicker. Put old school two pole switch and flickering stopped\n9#Great Setup, But Flawed Performance. The installation process was surprisingly simple, and the instructions were clear—definitely a plus. However, I experienced unexplained LED flickering issues that made the light unreliable for daily use. Since this seems like a design flaw rather than a one-off defect, I ended up returning it for a refund. Hopefully, the manufacturer addresses this in future versions, because the setup itself was hassle-free. Pros: ✔ Easy to install ✔ Straightforward instructions Cons: ❌ Persistent flickering issues ❌ Had to return for refund Verdict: Works well in theory, but the flickering makes it hard to recommend.\n10#Works well as a dimmer for a 5 dimmable LED light chandelier. Love it as a dimmer switch and also through an Alexa App. Best of both worlds.\n11#Convenient. I installed this switch to control my back patio light. I can program it to have the light come on a little before or after sunset and turn off at sunrise. This switch has a dimming feature that is very useful. We turn the light down while watching tv and can increase the light if we are playing games and need to see a little better.\n12#Good product. It's very easy to install, I recommend\n13#Easy-to-Use Smart Dimmer for a Great Price. I installed this Amazon Basics Smart Dimmer Switch, and it’s been working great! Setup was pretty straightforward, and it connected easily to Alexa for voice control and scheduling. The dimming feature is smooth and responsive, letting me adjust the brightness exactly how I want. The switch itself feels well-built and sturdy, not cheap or flimsy like some other smart switches. It works without a separate hub, which is a huge plus, and the installation was simple if you’re comfortable with basic wiring. Just make sure you have a neutral wire, since it won’t work without one. Overall, this is a solid smart dimmer at a great price. It’s perfect if you want hands-free lighting control without spending a fortune. Would definitely buy again!\n14#Device unresponsive after a year. Worked great for a year. Now it goes \"unresponsive\" . Did a reset on it and got it working for a half day then it say \"device is unresonsive\". I have reset it many times now. Still unresponsive.....now it is just a manual switch. At least they are cheap!\n15#Excellent Smart Dimmer Switch. Excellent smart dimmer switch. Replaced a Wemo Switch that was giving me problems. This was easy to install and connect back to my Alexa. Worth the expense.\n16#switch that will not switch. Neither switch would switch with power on the switch manually or through alexa. I missed the return date due to slow construction.\n17#The dimmer works but has a small issue. The dimmer switch was easy to wire and set up. It works with Alexa and touch buttons work. The downside is the likes to turn off the lights at any given time (I do not have a schedule set up). If you turn the lights back on at the switch, it turns back off. The same if you ask Alexa to turn lights back on, it will say not responding. You will have to wait a few mins and then you can turn the lights back on to where they will stay on. This only happens about three or four times a week so far.\n18#Very convenient. Using it with Alexa, doesn’t require extra app. Love it\n19#Works great. QR code didn't register for me. It mentioned I didn't have the right app but good thing alexa devices are easy to add (or should I say it auto-adds). My home switch wires didn't have a neutral, only had 2 blacks and a ground (older home). I ended up putting the red of the receptacle to the 240v home black wiring and the black of the receptacle to the black 120v home wire (used a volt meter). Then the white (neutral) of the receptacle to the ground along with the green.\n20#Very cool but not over 75 watt bulb. This is very cool but you have to figure out the wiring. The dimmer will not go down low enough on a 100 watt bulb. Use 75 watts or less.\n21#Only one person can control the light ! seems like good quality, installation was easy. Works well, but only one person can control it. Once you add it to your Alexa account no one else can add it! I wanted a solution that both me and my wife can use. With that said, I don't recommend unless only one person want to control it from his phone. Amazon says I have to switch my account to household account and merge it with my wife to be able to control which I am not interested in doing. maybe other brands like Lorton will allow more than one person to control! I would not recommend!\n22#Cheap, switch is hollow sounding and feels cheap. This unit is as cheap as it feels. After install it tested at 120v. As soon as a load was applied it dropped to 34v. This meant only dim lights available. Save your money\n23#Had to return item - Beware buying used smart devices. This was advertised as Like New. That used to mean something. This is the second Like New item I purchased that was nothing like new. The switch is very scratched, missing the wire connectors, face plate, documentation and there’s dry wall plaster all over it. Worst of all, Alexa was unable to connect to this abused device would, probably why it was returned in the first place!\n24#Stopped working after a month. I liked this dimmer at first—it looked nice and worked well. But after about a month, it started having problems. Now I have to press the button a few times to turn the light on or off. I tried to return it, but Amazon said the return window was closed, and there’s no warranty. It’s disappointing that it broke so quickly with no support. I wouldn’t buy this again.\n25#Easy to install and setup. Installed in my detached garage for outdoor lighting. With the app, Turns on off and dims easily. Able to turn lights on or off anywhere! Does not work with gfci receptacles, receptacles trip and won’t reset\n26#This thing is pretty useless. Half the time the Alexa app says the device is unresponsive. When it does work it frequently turns off the lights just to mess with me. It has a mind of its own.\n27#The Amazon 3-way switch doesn’t line up with a standard 3 switch plate! I had to file the cover plate opening for the 3-way to fit! The switch works great but it looks bed The mounting plate screws don’t line up. Let me know if you have a suggestion!\n28#Easy install but leaks energy. Easy to install and hooked up to alexa well but leaks. Lights are very faintly lit when in off posistion\n29#These are my goto switches. I have installed 5 of them for almost 2years now. No complaints. Congratulations through Alexa was a breeze.\n30#Very easy to install and link to Alexa. I tried two other “smart” switches. They took a lot of trial and error to setup. This was very easy.\n31#Piece of crap. Worked for a day and then died\n32#Works Great With Alexa. My previous smart dimmer stopped responding. I bought this one to eliminate the 3rd party outfit supporting the switches online. This connected to Alexa directly and has worked since being installed.\n33#Easy installation and quick setup. Love it. Easy installation and 2 minutes to setup on Alexa. The installation video is super easy to follow. Dimmer works great either manually or through Alexa.\n34#Works great - easy install. Works great - installed in about 30m.\n35#Quick setup. Quick install and setup!\n36#Easy setup. Seamless install with Alexa. Not like big box switches that website tells you half year later that your subscription has expired, e.g. your big box switches no longer works.\n37#Switch leaks current (i.e. ghost power) when 'off' and LED lights do NOT go completely off. Well, it seamlessly connected to Alexa, otherwise it would have been one star. Now the problem: This switch is listed as LED compatible, but the switch leaks power (i.e. 'ghost' power), so even when the switch is supposed to be 'off', there is a slight voltage being passed through. Not a problem with incandescents, but with low wattage LED bulbs, they still glow even when 'off'. I'm trying to find another solution, but it seems manufacturers don't know/care about the issue in any specs I've seen online.\n38#Works & looks great. Bought this during the Prime Day sale, mostly from a decorative viewpoint as I’ve been gradually replacing the switches around the house. I wasn’t looking for a ‘smart’ switch but the price was right & I’m glad I did. It’s used in the bedroom & now I can control it without getting up - perfect for when I’ve finished reading! Easy installation, nice quality, standard size. You can calibrate the dimming. 5 stars.\n39#Easy to program. Watch if next to other outlet. Product was very easy to set up. It has been installed in a tight box with two switches. The smart switch is sensitive and has been susceptible to phantom loads, causing a slight dim on the light when the smart switch was off.\n40#Doesn't work. UPDATE (4/1/25): against my better judgement I ordered another switch. It worked for ONE month. Amazon shows the item is returnable/replaceable until tomorrow, but their return system is not allowing me to process a return. Big thumbs down. Wired up the switch.. the power will light up the switch, but it doesn't work. I tried it in another location that is working correctly, but wouldn't work there either. I bought a regular Amazon Basics switch (non-dimmable) and that one works fine. Typically I would say they make returning the product or exchanging easy. For some reason it's not easy with this one. I would love an exchange to try it again.\n41#Flickers on most settings. Sometimes it flickers on anything but the lowest settings. I bought a second one, thinking maybe it was the wiring to that location, or the bulbs. Second one does the same thing, so now it's time to ditch these and try another brand.\n42#Works great! The included instructions easy to follow. Make sure you read through them before attempting to install. If your house wiring doesn’t have a red wire, you most likely have 2 black wires. So follow the instructions for the black wire first, that way the left over black wire will go to the red wire on the new switch.\n43#While off the switch is off, current still seems to flow almost like a night light. Everything that I look at says this shouldn't happen, but when the switch is off there is a small current flowing which lights the LEDs. It is a nice feature, but wonder if there is a defect in the product I have. I don't know if there will be an electrical issue in the future or do I need to return it for a working model. But then will that next one act the same way.\n44#These worked out better than expected! We replaced some incandescent fixtures in our kitchen with LED pucks and wanted to install dimmer switches for the two sets of lights. These worked out great, and as a bonus for us, they can be operated via our Amazon Echo in the kitchen . . . hands-free! (In addition to the manual method.) The brightness/dimness can also be controlled using Alexa, which is extremely handy when working at the counter.\n45#Really nice switch, worked perfectly with Alexa but had a tiny issue. :(. We really loved this switch, as it worked perfectly with Alexa and followed commands very well. The problem we experienced with this switch was out light brightness changing on it's own... Weird, I know, but our light would go dim, and then brighten up, sometimes going dim and then staying dim. It seemed to become worse as time went on. Sadly, we returned the switch, tried another, same problem. I purchased a much more expensive switch from Home Depot and it's been dead-on perfect. No issues. This is the very first time we have experienced any issue with an Amazon Basic product and I'm sure they worked out the issue. Our was built in the 1950's and our light does have LED bulbs, so that may have been the issue.\n46#Good. I have installed four of these switches and they are great. Note that this takes up a lot more space in your light switch wall box than standard switches. The width and depth are considerable. Some boxes may not accommodate, I had to replace mine to ensure a good fit and space for wires behind it. Once installed, the switch works great. Minus one star though, I did have a moment of mild panic once, where the switch stopped responding, not sure why, but maybe network issues... but it would not turn the light on or off. It seemed to clear itself up after a while. Seems to me that the switch should perform its normal on/off function regardless of network status or anything else, but that may not be the case.\n47#Just talk. Works great…easy to install\n48#Easy to use. Simple and works great!\n49#doesnt work. i bought 3 of these and unfortunately i waited 3 months to install them... and now i am outside the return window. The 1 that i bought in this order doesnt shut off, but will turn on and dim correctly. i installed 2 others that i bought and they work fine... so there must be somethoing wrong with the control board on this one.",
