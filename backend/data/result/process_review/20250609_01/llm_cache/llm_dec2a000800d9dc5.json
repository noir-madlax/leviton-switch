Replaced old bathroom switch! Works great still!\n1#Reliable Switch for High-Amp Bathroom Fan/Heater Combo. I purchased this switch to replace a faulty one controlling my Panasonic FV-0811VF1 WhisperWarm DC Ventilation Fan/Heater in the bathroom. Despite not being an electrician or a particularly skilled DIYer, I found the installation to be quite straightforward. The terminals on the back of the switch were clearly marked and conveniently matched the wiring of the original, broken switch. It was a simple matter of connecting the wires color to color, and I had the new switch installed within minutes. The switch itself has a firm but not overly stiff feel when toggling it on or off. It feels more substantial than a standard light switch, which gives me confidence in its ability to handle the load of the quiet yet powerful fan and the heater in my Panasonic unit. The standard white color blends seamlessly with the other switches in my bathroom. Given its low price point, the fact that it's rated for the necessary amperage of my Panasonic WhisperWarm fan/heater combo, and that it's UL listed for safety, I'm very pleased with this purchase. It seems durable after a month of use and effectively controls my bathroom fan and heater without any issues. If you need a reliable and easy-to-install switch for a similar application, especially for a unit like the Panasonic WhisperWarm, this is a great option.\n2#Screws are Junk. The screws on these \"commercial\" duty switches have become garbage. The heads strip out easily even when using the correct tools. I am a commercial retired electrician and Leviton is cheaping out. I can only imagine that the inside is also cheap and not what it used to be.\n3#Works as expected. Works as described.\n4#Outdoor infrared heater switch. I used this switch to control the high low settings of an outdoor infrared heater with a 16 amp rating. The heater company wanted four times the price for the same switch. I had it in two days from Amazon for a quarter of the price!\n5#Worked perfect. Was a little anxious ordering online since I wasnâ€™t sure this was going to be right one needed but worked perfect. Good price.\n6#Works great! I tried another off brand on Amazon that was cheaper and it didn't work. This one works perfectly.\n7#Great for the use I needed. Installed a combination fan/heater in my bath. This switch was perfect to enable separating the heating portion from the fan portion so that they could be used individually.\n8#It works like a switch. I like how you can turn on and off your devices. I needed 20 amp for garbage disposal, and this turns it on, and back off again. Pretty amazing!\n9#Good switch. Not much to review. It's does what it's supposed to do. Easy to install and works as intended.\n10#Broken within 2 weeks. The center of the switch has a rocker tap inside that is held in place by that thin section of plastic that runs across the center of the two switches. That snapped within 2 weeks of use leaving the power engaged on 1 switch. Very poor design with weak plastic as a center support for the two switches. They need to make a better and stronger support in the center for the rocker tabs. I emailed Leviton and they could care less. Stay away from this switch, it can be very dangerous\n11#Electricity. It works like it was supposed to\n12#Flawless. Worked perfectly\n13#Dual switch. I like that it fits in a normal switches place and gives you the option to add either a second light or a fan to a bathroom\n14#Electrician gave thumbs up. I needed this and my electrician gave thumbs up\n15#Let me use the sink light and under cabinet lights independently. I wanted to hardwire some undercabinet lighting in the kitchen, but had a single rocker switch for a light over the kitchen sink and I didn't want to lose the sink light or have both on the same switch. I found Legrand (RCD11WCC6) and Leviton (5627) dual switches to replace single rocker switches. The Legrand rocks up and down, while the Leviton rocks side to side so I used the Leviton for the kitchen application since it is next to an outlet, and the Legrand in the living room because we added a ceiling fan and had to convert two single rocker switches to a single and a double, and the Legrand allowed all three switches to rock in the same direction. Very pleased with the outcome of both.\n16#Just as needed. Wired up fine, no problems. Works great when we needed a double switch for bathroom fan & light with no room for a double box.\n17#Didnâ€™t last last 1.5 years. Top rocker tab broke after 1.5 years. Not really commercial grade when it breaks at home. Need to find a longer lasting one\n18#Much better option. Bought this and a box as an install for a heater. The heater companyâ€™s switch is almost $100. This, the box, and cover plate makes it under $30 for a diy build.\n19#It was a 20 amp switch which will handle large loads at 120 volts. Like the product. Using it to break one side of a 240 volt heat lamp\n20#Dirty when it arrived. Bought it brand new and it had some smudges and black stuff on it.\n21#Screw broken in the electrical box!!! Cheap made-in USA garbage. Nowadays made-in USA is a brand of trash.\n22#Pricey but perfect. I needed the space in a four-gang box to this was the perfect solution. Outrageously priced but when youâ€™re in a bind... they gotcha. This is a great option for ceiling fan and light controls if you have an older fan and donâ€™t want to pull the chain.\n23#Great product for my recess lights! This was great!!! Helps me from adding another box on the wall!!!!!\n24#Doesn't last. Had one that lasted about a year. Replaced it 3 months ago and it's already dead. Definitely not worth it.\n25#Great price. Regular switch...the price is the best I've found.\n26#Control for outdoor patio heater. Perfect fit to control my dual element outdoor heater\n27#Worked for what I needed. Needed the switch because I had a curio in front of double switch, switched out two singles for this double stacked plus, workEd great\n28#Worked perfectly to split 1 switch into 2. When we moved into our new condo, the bathroom lights and fan were wired within 1 switch. Pretty inconvenient if the fan in each bathroom needed to be left on for a longer time to remove condensation or possibly odors. Isnâ€™t that what the purpose of the fan is for? And why have the lights on for that extended time? This switch allowed splitting the lights and the fan each onto their own switch, without having to increase the box size and add a second individual switch.\n29#The Right Product. Easy to install and use. Great price as well.\n30#Great product. Exactly what I needed. 20 amp switches like this can't be found in stores.\n31#Good buy. Good for the money\n32#Just as exactly as described.... Just exactly ad described\n33#Worked great for our 40 year old house. Needed a 20amp double switch to operate a heat lamp/fan in a bathroom of a 40 year old house. Great fit.\n34#Perfect replacement for our ceiling fan/light single switch. I needed to control a ceiling fan and light in a bedroom separately with 2 switches instead of one in a single gangbox. This fit and matched my other switches in the house perfectly.\n35#Five Stars. work just fine\n36#Five Stars. These switches switch things on and switch things off.\n37#Five Stars. Works as suspected\n38#Five Stars. Works perfectly. None of the box stores had a 20 amp comparable.\n39#Works great for bathroom fan and. No \"Box\" stores in my area had the 20 amp version. I was lucky to find this switch online. Works great for bathroom fan and heater\n40#Five Stars. works as described!\n41#Never the less the switch works great. The Packtage was ripped open and the switch removed from the box and just thrown into the parcel.Never the less the switch works great.\n42#Good solid and quiet switch. Very good looking, nice smooth action, and quiet. Easy installation.\n43#Gets the job done. It gets the job done and works fine.\n44#Well made combination switch. When a second switch is needed to do the job without getting too involved this is the way to go. Makes electrical work alot easier that to cxut in a second gem box to mount additional; switcxh\n45#Five Stars. as described\n46#Five Stars. Using it switch on/off two 20amp infrared heating elements. Worked just as described!",
