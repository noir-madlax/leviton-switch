Easy to install works great and works with SmartThings!\n1#Fragile, Non-intuitive pairing. Works for a while. Very kludgy procedure for adding to SmartThings. Power cutoff/surge can kill these switches. Wouldn’t buy again.\n2#Lots of issues. I found it difficult to pair with my zwave system, but once I finally did get it paired it keeps dropping, even though devices around it continue to work fine.\n3#Excellent if you are able to and have the patience to get it recognized. Will work with Ring Alarm! Excellent but only if you are able to install it. Easy with Smart Things (which Alexa will automatically recognize). Extremely tricky trying to connect to Ring Alarm. I finally managed to do it but I need to document how I did it because it was mostly accidental. With this switch installed with Ring Alarm, you can have an alarm, light, connect to wifi devices through Alexa etc. This is a big deal. Just remember this thing is ZWave (needed to connect to Ring Alarm) and it is a switch, not a dimmer. You want a switch that opens and closes with a relay.\n4#Doing the job. Have installed a number of these with reasonably good success. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 is that one of them failed after about a year or two.\n5#Susceptible to damage due to power issues. This brand burns out easily if you get surges. Leviton is more expensive but more resilient to hits.\n6#Pay attention. This item requires a hub, i did not see this when purchasing\n7#these are jasco switches, not GE. These are the awful jasco switches like were shown in a few ltt videos. That said, I've had 0 issues integrating them into my setup. It couldn't have been easier. They even include a neutral wire with tinned ends. Easy peasy\n8#Price coul be better. It's a nice product, but I hope someday its cost decay.\n9#Requires Zwave hub. They don’t make it clear the this switch requires a Zwave “Hub”. They say “comparable with Ring” but they don’t tell you it’s only compatible if you have the Ring alarm base. This switch would not connect to any of my remote device apps.\n10#MUST BUY AN ADDITIONAL 'HUB CONTROLLER' TO WORK. \"The switch is NOT a standalone device. it MUST be used with a Enbrighten smart control for z-wave, zigbee or bluetooth home automation. This 'info' should be front and center in the product description! Now it gets returned!! They really need to make a device that works with Alexa without the extra purchase of a HUB. I gave it 5 stars so people read about this! EDIT to add today I received an email explaining how to use the switch: \"Get the Enbrighten app from Google Play Store or Apple App Store. Follow the steps to set up your device.\" I read the instructions and don't recall this being there. Had they included the above I might have tried the app!! No wonder it's the most returned item!!\n11#Not a 3 way switch. I purchased 20 of these as I wanted to replace many of the switches in my house. Most of my current switches are 3-way so I thought it would be ideal. Unfortunately after spending many hours wiring them in, every 3-way in my house did not work. These seem to work fine as a single switch, but I bought these because of the 3-way passthrough.\n12#They work. Easy connect to my ADT controller\n13#New to me but it works. I was one of those people who thought that anything returned to Amazon actually went to auction companies and they never touched it again. Apparently I am wrong because although I purchased a “new” unit, what I received could only be described as “open box.” To get to the point regarding the switch, the directions are clear and I had it integrated into my home Zwave network in a few minutes - and it works. It identified as a GE brand during installation (on my hub). No issues yet. I probably would have rated it 5-stars if the packaging was factory-sealed. I completely overlooked this in the description - this switch doesn’t illuminate when it’s in the off position like some others that I own do. So if this is important to you, consider a different make possibly.\n14#Works well. I'm not sure why anyone is not giving these a great review. Nor do I understand why they are a \"Frequently returned item\". They work. They connect to my SmartThings hub. I can control my lights. A couple of notes: 1) The model I bought is not a dimmer - just on and off - I knew that when I ordered them and they do just that 2) They are supposed to be able to sense the \"in\" and \"out\" - I had to fiddle with the wires and swap the \"in\" and \"out\" connections - it took 5 minutes. They fit in the switch box - keep in mind that ALL smart switches are bigger than a simple switch - you might have to push the wires around to make it fit. To be clear, neither of these caused any issue and are quickly handled.\n15#Was sent a refurb even though I ordered a new item. The switch I received has a sticker identifying it as a refurb even though I ordered a new item at the same price as a new item. The package had obviously been resealed. This is misrepresentation - if I’m getting a refurb, it should be declared and priced accordingly.\n16#Works but not backlit on switch. It’s advertised as backlit on the images. That’s not the case. It’s a basic Zwave compatible switch.\n17#Easy install with connection wires. The four connection wires are pre-installed with plenty of slack to make installation easy with included wire nuts, although I used Wago wire connectors to make things even easier. There was plenty of room in the middle position of a triple gang box for this unit. Installation was fast, and network setup was easy. Alexa operation is flawless.\n18#Does not pair with Vera hub and no customer support. Purchased 24 pack. It did not pair with Vera hib. No customer support after mutliple calls. Do not buy.\n19#Connects up first time every time Update: several failed, replacements PITA. I have lots of these. These were almond so cheaper because of that I guess. Used these in shop so didn't care. I did have one of the (white) ones fail in the house a while back. So you never know on reliability. Update: Recent storm blew out four of these. This time around they were a total PITA to get connected to Smartthings. Finally got them all connected after over an hour of pairing attempts, un-pairing and restating Smartthings app.\n20#Weak connection. The switch constantly disconnects from my Z wave system. Very disappointing, but unfortunately, it’s the only switch I could find in this style.\n21#Good switch. I bought this by mistake. Read the description this switch does require a hub to work with Alexa, and probably the reason it is frequently returned.\n22#Works well with my Zwave Vera hub. These switches say GE but I believe they are made by Jasco, I having using them for years very few issues. Keep in mind these will only work a hub you can not integrate them directly with Alexa.\n23#Switch on off makes a loud click sound. Click sound is very loud\n24#Dont buy this. Its not compatible with anything. Not compatible with alexa. Not compatible with google home. Not compatible with smart life. Not compatible with anything you have or are using in your home. Poor technology, outdated. Requires re installing on required hub every time power is lost. Dont buy.\n25#You need an expensive hub to use! Yes, it was hidden in the description, but, this switch requires an expensive hub to use. It wasn't brought to my attention after it was installed. The lights also pulsated which was odd. Might be a good product if you already have a hub.\n26#Good deal . Thanks. I buy this switch to replace the Wi-Fi problem some time off line, so far this switch work good for sensor turn on bath fan .\n27#Failure to go into Pairing Mode. Ordered another after the first one would not activate pairing same problem with the first one even with their app, I have many gosund products that I had no issues with\n28#Works well with Ring system and Alexa. Def requires a neutral wire. Works well with Ring system and Alexa. Def requires a neutral wire I also received a clearly opened/used unit so that wasnt great\n29#Good device, works flawlessly with Home Assistant. I am generally happy with JASCO products (they made products for GE and now under Enbrighten brand. While this is not too desired color and went on sale, I installed multiple in basement, garage and out-of-sight locations. It has smaller form factor so it fits easier into tight boxes. Only complaint I have that it doesn't have any status LED which I would find very useful. Also pairing was a bit problematic, I had to reset, pair, reset, pair, but eventually it went nicely with S2 security. (It may be fault of Home Assistant or unit, can't tell)\n30#good product. highly recommend\n31#I love these units. I have about 20 of these units around my home, and I love them. The new version are rock solid, the connection never drops. At this price, you can not go wrong.\n32#Short lifes. These embrighten switches do not last long at all. A bunch just died. One by one, like domino's. Terrible product.\n33#Doesn’t Match. I purchased 2 of these switches to automate 2 lights in a bank of 4 switches. These switches don’t match the existing switches. The toggle does move full to the up or down position. This makes them look bad when combined with existing switches in same box. The offering also indicated that no neutral wire was required. This is incorrect.\n34#Works great with Vivint Home System. Easy to connect. Outlet is a good size to fit in single gang wall box with room for wires. Pairs great with Vivint system for automatic operation or timing.\n35#Zwave is worth swapping for Zwave Plus. Swapped four ge toggle switches for these ge zwave plus switches. Much easier to include, to adapt and to switch. Much quicker too. If you must have skinny toggle switches, these are the ones to buy. Wire connectors are sturdy. Very easy to install.\n36#Easy to install and integrate into the home system. I bought this to automate the porch lights, and this was exactly what I wanted. The lighted switch when on is a nice touch.\n37#Nice switch, but over priced. The functionality and quality of the switch is good. It’s just overpriced.\n38#Initial setup went well. Speedy switching. Switch works great. Integrated perfectly in my Ring Alarm z-wave setup. Integrated immediately into Alexa with no further configuration. Switch response to Alexa voice commands is almost instantaneous versus my WeMo plugs that have a second or two delay. No flicker at all on two 75W equivalent LED bulbs that are in a fan. This was for lights on a year 2000 fan with separate light and fan speed switches, so I was able to automate the light switch. I can see from some other reviews here that the switches don't last. I'll report back if that happens to me.\n39#Poor Product Description. I have successfully installed this device and have it incorporated into my \"smart home\" network. It SHOULD NOT be called \"3-way\" in the technical information if it can't work with a conventional 3-way switch and required a special additional switch which isn't clearly identified. The printed installation instructions use such a small font they are EXTREMELY difficult to read. Hidden in the instructions is a disclaimer that the switch can be permanently damaged if used with a conventional 3-way switch installation instead of their special products.\n40#smaller footprint inside junction box. Better than the older model\n41#Doesn't work with Alexa unless you spend $120 for a Z wave hub. It's a nicely designed switch that was easy to install. Unfortunately, unless you spend another $120 for a Z wave hub, it's just a manual switch. .. would have been nice if they would have included that information in nice big letters at the top of the page instead of buried on the last line of small print at the end of the description. I'm sending it back. It doesn't make sense to spend $160 for a light switch.\n42#Good deal. No trouble at all.",
