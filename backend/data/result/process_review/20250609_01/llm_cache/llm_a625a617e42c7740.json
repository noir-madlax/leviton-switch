After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Single Pole Rocker Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Single Pole Rocker Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment. Include all mentioned reasons, or \"?\" if none can be inferred. <USE_REASON> and <USE> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- <PHYSICAL>/<PERF> and <DETAIL> MUST NOT include:\n  * Generic statements without details (e.g., \"good\", \"bad quality\")\n  * Issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., \"fast shipping\", \"delivery time\")\n- If a review mentions any physical aspect, related performance, or use together, extract them as separate entries under \"phy,\" \"perf,\" and \"use,\" with no overlap.\n- Make sure each <DETAIL> is under the most relevant <PHYSICAL> or <PERF> in the context of Single Pole Rocker Switches\n- Preserve negations\n\nKey Instructions:\n- Break down reviews with multiple aspects, performances, or uses into individual entries.\n- Escape special characters with backslash that could cause JSON syntax errors.\n- Include only explicitly mentioned reasons, and use \"?\" where no reason is mentioned.\n\nFinal Checklist:\n- Go through all reviews and ensure that no aspect, performance, use, or reason is omitted, even if only mentioned once.\n- Review all entries to ensure proper separation between aspects, performances, and uses.\n\nPrint the JSON result only.\nInput format:\n<ID>#<review>\n\n[[INPUT]]\n0#Works fine color does not even match their own outlets. Unless you just want cheap to have cheap do not get these. The color is off from even their own cover plates and has caused us many problems. We just placed on so you can see.\n1#Plain and simple. Hey, they work. Only 4 stars is because in very tiny print (hard to see) is the word \"TOP\" engraved in the metal. If you miss it, you'll install the switch incorrectly and have to do it over. I missed several of them.\n2#CML interruptor de pared (50 unidades). Al mudarme de casa, tuvimos que cambiar todos los switches y los tomacorrientes. Estos fueron una buena opcion. Funcionan bien y no son tan costosos.\n3#Cheap. Switches are not great, just installed them yesterday had a few bad ones and most of them have a gap on the top… if I didn’t wait 30 days I would return them… I spent all day replacing them with levitons. Don’t waste your time with these\n4#Off white. There “white has a hint of beige to it. So typical cover plates stand out.\n5#Great quality. Great value\n6#Color doesn't match. The color doesn't match to the standard stuff that you get at Home Depot it's a lot more yellow\n7#Nice affordable light switches! Easy installation, great value for your money, nice appearance and grest quality!\n8#Easy to change out. These are easy to change out for a modern feel.\n9#RÁPIDO. Buen producto\n10#Wrong color. The color doesn’t match with anything not even with their own products. I would like to return this\n11#Not worth the money. The switches don't work all the time. Some of them never worked and I've had to replace about 8 out of 50. Compared to Levington I've only had to replace 2 out of a thousand+.\n12#quality. not worth the price\n13#Easy to install. Looks great. Easy upgrade from flip switch. Matches plate covers. They look great installed but don’t feel very sturdy but should be ok with normal use. Better value than box store price. Hubby installed without needing an electrician. *Make sure power is off during installation.\n14#Worth it. Changed out all the ones in our house and I swear we have like 50 light switches. These were nice and east to instal…. If you no what your doing. Turn off power before installing. It was well worth the money and cheaper then me buying them at home depo\n15#Buy it again. Worth the money, would buy it again",
