I ordered and installed a number of these back in September 2022. Within a year one started making the light flicker at in-between power levels. Now I have had four of them break making it impossible to turn them on or off. The white post in the cover eventually breaks under normal use. These switches are not durable. I bought another brand to replace them, switches that simply have a slider for on/off and dimming whickhwould seem to be more durable by design.\n1#Buzzes, has a delay, doesn't dim all the way. The buzzing is especially loud when the brightness is lower. Lights also occasionally flicker. Properly installed. How hard is it to make a dimmable light switch? Listen closely in the video for buzzing, in a quiet room I can hear it from the other side.\n2#Great quality switch. Easy switch to install don’t use up much electric box space and believe me my house has those nailed in ones yes 10p nails right through the box uggg nifty 50s lol the switch fit perfectly with room to spare too easy to use yes your right nothings perfect there is a half second delay not instant on has a relay and compositor in it so it can dim those led bulbs and no flickering or self shut down from over heating as with other brands Ugg I used Philips led dimmable bulbs 2~60w equivalent sram to be a good pairing oh this switch must be properly grounded had to find and dig out those bare wires Ugg to save time they used to twist them together behind the box the only hard part for me\n3#Poor design, fails after a while. After about a year light started flickering. Upon inspection we found out it was the switch, poor design.\n4#OK but flickers LEDs at low settings. Spend a little more and get a better one. If you have LEDs. OK dimmer but flickers at low settings. Spend a little more and get a better one. Has some nice features but not great for LED\n5#It works. Liked everything about it.\n6#Works well, but the “click” is a bit loud. Installed this in our primary bathroom, which has a light fixture that contains eight LED bulbs and can be too bright if you’re getting up to use the bathroom at night. The dimming function works smoothly, and the option to set a minimum brightness is useful. Just one minor gripe: The audible “click” you hear when turning the switch on is surprisingly loud, especially at night when the house is quiet.\n7#Oh wow a light switch. What can I say? It turns the lights on and off. With the built in dimmer slide it dims the lights. What an amazing concept. A light switch that works as expected.\n8#Didn’t work for my LEDs. Lights stayed on and never fully shut off. Went with a different LED compatible switch and it worked.\n9#HAVE SWITCHED CHECKED BY ELECTRICIAN IF INSTALLATION DELAYED BEYOND ALLOWED RETURN. I purchased two of these GE rocker style dimmer. It was the switch I I selected as it had dimmer feature and manufactured by famous GE, and was reasonably priced. The order was back ordered by several weeks so I called off my licensed electrician until they arrived on August 13, 2024. Electrician was a month out and came to install them on September 16, 2024. Unfortunately, one worked as it should and one was defected. The electrician performed a simple test on the defective switch, which confirmed it was inoperable. I wish I knew there was a test I could have performed within the 30 return period, now the cost for the good switch just doubled. It is said that if you have one foot in a pail of hot water and one foot in a pail of cold water, statically you are comfortable - but a 50% \"reject\" on this famous brand of switch has earned it 2 1/2 star rating, not very comfortable.\n10#My go-to dimmer. I do regular maintenance and upgrades to a few dozen rentals...and when a dimmer is called for (see-LED recessed fixtures), this is the one I go to everytime. Not the absolute cheapest available but ease of install and 100% reliability make the extra few bucks well worth it to me. Looks great, functions even better. No noise, no flicker, no problems.\n11#Nice. Excellent product.\n12#Good switch. We were having a problem with the original dimmer switch we had purchased with our LED light no being able to dim below half way, without the lights flashing and strobing. We bought this switch, swapped it out, works perfectly. Can have the light fully dimmed or turned up all the way, with no problem. Good product!\n13#Good Dimmer Switch. Works once installed. The one thing is that the rocker switch is detachable to select the type of lights used. If it isn't positioned exactly right when the faceplate is installed, the rocker switch doesn't work.\n14#Switch Did Not Work. Electrician installed it, but switch did not work. Wanted to return it, but it was outside of the return window.\n15#Works pretty well with LED overhead light fixture. Not perfect but worked better wth LED light fixture than older dimmer (pre-LED). Like small built in LED night light.\n16#Not a smooth dimmer. This dimmer does not dim very well. There seems to be a hesitation of the light when dimming and does not dim as low as I would like. The three way function leaves a small amount of voltage on the lights even after I turn it off.\n17#Won’t dim. Installed and it turned the light on and dimmed it smoothly but, after a little while it stop dimming. Contacted Amazon and they are sending a replacement within two days. This model was less then $20 and I hope it works out well. Will update if the new one works out. Update: The replacement came and worked out well. The slider seems to operate very smoothly. Lights do not flicker like my original dimmer switch after I put in dimmable light bulbs. Will buy again to replace another dimmer switch I have in the same room but, operate a different set of lights\n18#super easy to install! solid product, works like a charm, easy to install.\n19#The dimmer does not work at all. The dimmer does not work at all. I replaced with another one under $9.00 and everything worked as expected\n20#Rocker Failed. Switch failed mechanically (rocker loose, didn't click on/off) after about 1 year. Would have been great if it had just lasted.\n21#It works. Worked as advertised, easy to install. 5 *\n22#Discreet dimmer switch. Install was easy and has been working great for months.\n23#Great! Works well with my dimmable LED bulbs. No flickering\n24#Very cheap plastic, DOES NOT WORK IN MULTI-GANG BOX. Not even 6 months later installing, the pressure from wires in a multi-gang box broke the plastic off the front sides, not to mention the dimmer slider itself it stuck. These are cheap contractor-grade, I really recommend buying something a little more $ (even from GE), that is more durable.\n25#Very Cheap. Cheaply made\n26#Purchased new but recieved 2 used open packages. Both switches were obviously used! Both switches didn't work. My fault for not checking items as soon a I got them. When I went to install them weeks later I discovered this but it was passed the 30 day return window.\n27#Great switch. Very easy to wire, works great\n28#Dimmer function stopped working. The dimmer function stopped working just at the one year mark. Having to buy a new switch.\n29#Flickering. Great look and value, however my LED ceiling lights flicker when dimmed below 50%\n30#Dimmer slide problematic. The dimmer slide does not move easily\n31#Works great. Looks nice and works well. Simple to install.\n32#Works perfectly, but BEWARE--no FACEPLATE included. Works perfectly, straightforward 3 wire install. NOTE---there is no Faceplate included with this--only the actual switch. I didn't need a faceplate, but if you're replacing a normal toggle switch, you'll need to buy a new faceplate also. Took one star off for this---they should mention that in the listing since the majority of other switches on AMAZON include a new faceplate. I bought this because it was name-brand GE.\n33#Broken upon arrival. This switch was literally broken before I opened the box, I didn't know this though, so I installed it only to find it was junk. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this product.\n34#A good product. Easy to install, easy to use, and it looks good, too.\n35#First off there is no value for the money anymore. Its a good dimmer with a design flaw. When the switch is in the on position the bottom of the rocker sticks out pass the dimmer slider which is about 1/8 inch from the rocker its should be further away bigger or on the side\n36#Works great. Works great. Less expensive than from the big box stores\n37#As Described. Switch performs as-described. Easy installation, fits great and works on incandescent lamps.\n38#Paddle switch with a twist. Or should I say slider. I like the configuration. It's easy to install.\n39#Traditional LED dimmer at the right price. I was looking for a dimmer switch for recessed lighting (6 bulbs) but wanted it to match the adjacent switch (in the two gang box). This fit the bill… it’s a little smaller due to the slider, but still has similar aesthetics & function to satisfy my snobbery. The switch fit perfectly and works flawlessly. The price was also a major factor…and (not sure why exactly) but I felt more confident with it being a GE product. I’m sure to buy more…\n40#Great decorator rocker dimmer switch. Easy install. Perfect fit. Good light control. Zero hum or noise when dimming LEDs\n41#Easy to install and dimmer function is great. I installed three of the GE dimmer switches in the basement. They replaced the original paddle switch so the Grandkids will still be able to turn on the lights. The dimmer functionailty works as expected. Very happy with product.\n42#Easy install works great. Package to wall in 10 min. Wish I had installed this sooner\n43#Dinner switch shorts out of too low. Easy to install, the ones were Flared so added a little time to the install as I have the click lock connections for soldered ends. Dims when on low and kind of flickers.\n44#Works well, no flicker. I am pleased that it works properly without flicker. I tried two other units from different manufacturers, they flickered when dimming. It is controlling 9 LED bulbs, 90 watts total. Easy to install, no issues.\n45#Me like! Works a dim perfectly\n46#All 3 failed in just about 2 years. Single household, kitchen, bathroom, hallway installation. All 3 dimmers broke. A plastic piece inside breaks and makes the dimmer useless.\n47#Great value. Less than half the Home Depot price for a dimmable rocker switch. Easy to install. Good directions. Highly recommend.\n48#Lasted less than 3 months. Light switches should last year's. In less than 3 months it stopped working.\n49#very good product. Now I can enjoy having the right level of light where I need it. This dimmer works well and was indeed easy to install.",
