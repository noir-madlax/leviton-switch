These switches keep breaking. I consistently have to reset them not even 1 day after programming them. I wish I would bought these switches from a different company\n1#Didn't work as described. It lowers the lights but not much at off. Very sensitive, cuts off. I had three of these and they were a disappointment. I don't recommend this product.\n2#Safety concerns. Quality is debatable. The electric wire seems to be too thin and rips easily. It sparked the first time it was turned on, and burned the wire coating around it.\n3#It was easy to install and nice. What a wonderful difference they make in my house. Being able to change the lighting is so nice and yet practical . Thanks again\n4#the items has functionality issues. The items purchased not working properly and cuasing flicker the lights since our light fixtur/bulbs are dimmable and should work with purchased dimmers.\n5#Can‚Äôt recommend Treatlife anymore longer. Too many failures. I installed 30 or so of these Treatlife switches and I‚Äôve switched to Kasra as the Treatlife are all slowly failing. Someone analyzed the failures and came up with a low quality capacitor that is giving out. I don‚Äôt recommend these to anyone anymore. They were inexpensive but not in the long run\n6#Problem when installing more than one switch. It doesn't work well when you install more than three in the same house. The communication between the switches is crossed and when you turn on one light, another one also turns on without touching it\n7#I use the brand for years customer service is excellent. I've been using these for about 10 yrs. The wifi on one stop working and they sent me a replacement\n8#Works. Worked great üëç\n9#Amazing Lights. These lights are amazing. I'm slowly making my house a smart house and I love how I can set times for the lights to turn on and off. I get home late a few nights a week, and I don't like my indoor cats to be in the dark but also hated turning lights on at 5am for 12-14 hours later. Now I turn them on through the app or set a timer through the app and never have to think about it. It's great and I highly recommend these lights.\n10#it flickers! I don‚Äôt know what all the reviews are talking about‚Äîit flickers! Electrician installed it on new wiring house , and it flickers. I had to return it.\n11#Buyer beware. Beware, these break down quickly ! I installed 6 of these light switches and it seemed like a great idea for my home . Over the last 2 years each of them have malfunctioned and no longer work. What a waste of money!!!!\n12#Good looking switches. I bought these because I loved their look for a dimmer and the capacitive touch feature. I still love the look and touch feature, but my living room lights will randomly go off. My guess is the switch is overheating and protecting itself. Even though it‚Äôs a protection my wife finds it very annoying. I only have 8 led lights in parallel and this switch can‚Äôt handle it. I‚Äôm going to have to take the dimmers out of the circuit and replace with normal switches.\n13#Not reliable enough. I have been using these since 2019. EVERYTIME I have a power outage at my residence, at least one if not two of these need to be reconnected to my network! Now one out of the 4 pack I purchased will not reconnect to my wifi network at all. I have used 3 different wi-fi routers all with the same issue throughout the years!\n14#These DO NOT last. The house we bought had older light switches that didn‚Äôt work with LED lights. I bought these so we could use LED lights. Fast forward 2 1/2 years and I‚Äôve had to replace 1/2 of them already because they won‚Äôt turn on any longer. Save yourself the hassle and get something else.\n15#Super user friendly. Perfect for the application that I had\n16#poorly manufactured product. Be careful, I do not recommend that you buy these switches, they are of very poor quality. I have many problems after installing these switches with a professional electrician, I installed these switches throughout my house and they turned on and off normally, but when I wanted to do dimmer in the living room, they dimmed all the lights in the house. I contacted the seller's customer service and they did not give me any solution since the products have a big factory problem. I already solved the problem by buying other switches from another brand but the TREATLIFE ones are going to the trash so the time to return them has passed, stay away from this product, look for something different from this brand, this was my experience and I would not want anyone else to have this problem. Ojo, no les recomiendo que compren estos interruptores, son de muy mala calidad. Yo tengo muchos problemas despu√©s de instalar estos interruptores con un electricista profesional, instale estos interruptores en toda mi casa y se encend√≠an y apagaban normalmente, pero cuando quise hacer dimmer en la sala, atenuaron todas las luces de la casa. Me comuniqu√© con el servicio al cliente del vendedor y no me dieron ninguna soluci√≥n ya que los productos tienen un gran problema de f√°brica. Ya solucion√© el problema comprando otros interruptores de otra marca pero los de TREATLIFE se van a la basura as√≠ que ya pas√≥ el tiempo de devolverlos, al√©jense de este producto, busquen algo diferente de esta marca, esta fue mi experiencia y no quisiera que nadie m√°s tenga este problema.\n17#Very very easy to set up!! Is pretty much plug and play!! Set up account, ensure your on your 2.4g wifi and follow simple instructions!!\n18#Stopped working in less than two years. I was satisfied with them until last week, when two of them stopped working. It's been less than two years since I bought them. I also experience occasional flickering with the light switch dimmer.\n19#Not smart. Got 6 of these and they'll go offline or unresponsive at least once a week .\n20#Simple Truth - these are not ok. I purchased these to replace a different set of smart switches. They were of decent quality and normal size. They are loud when clicking and for some reason aren‚Äôt the smoothest. I like the appearance but the only way to set them at a consistent brightness when turning them on is in the app. People not familiar with this switch get confused when turning the switches on and off since both actions just require pressing the down function. My guests also change the brightness accidentally because it can‚Äôt be locked to stay at a certain level. The button functionality could be better. It‚Äôs not a deal breaker but there was nothing to win me over either. There is no built in timer but works great with smart home devices. It responds quickly.\n21#Better than expected. Sturdy well made and work great\n22#Crappy Tech Support. After only a month one switch stopped working on manual press. Tech support made me go through useless trouble shooting and then stopped responding to me for days. I had to purchase a new switch and install it, and then they wanted a video of the switch showing the problem. I'm not going to reinstall the switch for a video. So they can see that it doesn't work. I'll take the loss and not buy from them again.\n23#Not the best. Lights flickers because of switch\n24#Worked and then STOPPED PERIOD do not but. DO NOT BUY! Stopped working with Alexa. Very frustrating. Complete waste of money and time.\n25#Switch glows 24/7 and is flaky. I've had these switches installed for a few months and am dissatisfied with how they are unreliable after a power outage. Sometimes they come up in a \"not available\" state. I reached out to Treatlife and their solution was to cycle power on them. That worked, but annoying to have to do this on random switches after every power outage. Additionally, the indicator light is NOT customizable like with their other switches. If you like to sleep in the dark and don't want a night light shining 24/7 then this switch is not for you. Treatlife fails to mention this on their product page and is not helpful thus far when contacted.\n26#Lights flicker. My new dimmable led lights flicker way to much with these switches. I bought 8 total amd have issues with all. They don't dim down to much either. Not happy with these.\n27#easy to install. Easy to install and set-up. Use them to turn on outside deck lighting.\n28#Junk. Barely dims the lights. Tried with another brand dimmer switch and everything worked fine. Don‚Äôt buy these, they are total junk.\n29#Great product and great price. This Dimmer Switch is a fantastic addition to any smart home setup. Installation is straightforward, making it accessible even for those who aren't particularly tech-savvy. The switches integrate seamlessly with Alexa and Google Home, allowing for convenient voice control to adjust your lighting effortlessly. One of the standout features is the TREATLIFE app, which provides additional customization options. You can set schedules, create lighting scenes, and adjust brightness levels, all from your smartphone. This flexibility enhances the overall user experience, making it easy to create the perfect ambiance for any occasion. Another great aspect is that you don‚Äôt have to connect it to Wi-Fi for it to function. This means you can use it like a regular light switch, which is perfect for households where not everyone wants to engage with smart technology. Even without the smart features enabled, the switch operates effectively and reliably, ensuring your lights can be controlled as usual. The dimmer function works smoothly, allowing for precise control over lighting levels, which is particularly nice for creating a cozy atmosphere in living spaces or dining areas. Overall, it's offers a great value for upgrading your home lighting while providing the flexibility of smart features when you want them. It‚Äôs a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to enhance their smart home experience!\n30#It does not deliver. I want to prevent people from acquiring this product. Unstable apps and wall switches are challenging to pair most of the time. I purchased 50+ switches, but they still need to deliver.\n31#Works good until it doesn't. Worked a little over three years now it randomly blinks red/pink and wifi stopped working. Treatlife warranty is only 2 years when a light switch should work for 20+ years. Amazon basic has a better warranty.\n32#Bulbs are noisy and hum with these. I bought these in bulk on prime day a while back and have installed about 6 now. The usuasable dimming range for me that doesn't produce a very obnoxious hum from the bulbs is like 5 to 15 %, and 90% to 100%. It makes them less than ideal. I thought it was the bulbs I was using in my home, but tonight I installed one at a friend's house and it did the same thing. She has Lutron dimmers on the same model of can fixtures that don't hum in her kitchen, but lights on this switch in the bathroom hum like crazy. I tried all three settings in the app, it didn't fix the humming. To be clear, all of the bulbs connected to the dimmers are dimmable. Bottom line. They are priced well, but for as often as you are going to need to purchase them, I'd recommend getting the better Lutron product.\n33#Poor quality-Dimmer function stopped working. Only after a day, two of my LEDs blew cause of high current, after replacing them, the switches dimming option stopped working. Now it‚Äôs just working as a normal switch. Poor build quality\n34#Excellent dimmer switch! Had to replace over 20 smart switches after a lightning strike took out my existing ones. These switches are better, and less expensive than my previous. No hub needed, easy installation, easy to dim, and I really like the sleek look.\n35#Good. Great value for the money easy to connect to the WiFi\n36#These are OK, but not great. I installed three of these and they work okay. The dimmer is controlled by a vertical touch sensor in the middle of the switch. I like the rocker arm controls that are on my Lutron dimmers better. The dimmer is not smooth. There are like 6 intensity graduations, but it suffices. I thought it would be better using the app, but it is the same. Thank god the Treatlife app automatically found the switches so installation was easy otherwise they have to be manually installed and it is pain because I tried and it wouldn‚Äôt connect to my wi-fi ‚Ä¶.. something to do with 2.4 Ghertz. couldn‚Äôt get past it. However, as soon as I gave up and went back to the main screen, ‚ÄúFound New Device‚Äù would pop up and it connected to the wi-fi perfectly. I bought some Eaton smart dimmers that were not too expensive. I plan to try those. Eaton is a good brand. I wish I could afford Lutron, but $50+ per switch is too much for me.\n37#Wow junk I‚Äôm replacing with another brand. After less than 1 year of hardly using these dimmers, 3 out of 4 switches do not turn on or off anymore. The mechanism that pushes the button out after it‚Äôs pushed in has just stopped working, probably from the HIGH heat these dimmers produce. Like wow why is this junk product rated 4 stars and why more people aren‚Äôt complaining about this issue. 3 out of 4 bad switches tells me I‚Äôm not the only one having this problem. Buying another brand to replace these as I write this review.\n38#Constantly \"unavailable\" in apps. A dozen smart switches from multiple brands, so coming from experience this is seemingly a really nice dimmer switch that my family loved but it's never available to control through any app. Sucks because I do like the look and functionality of it.\n39#Switch seems great at 1st, but is very annoying as it starts to fail. So, I purchased a TreatLife Switch to replace a failing old Fan/Light Switch. I loved it. And, it looked so attractive, and was easy to use! Because it worked great, it convinced me to get TreatLife switches for all the other rooms in my home. And, ... this was where my nightmare began. Note: this switches will start to glitch early on is there are more than 1 treatlife switch on the same breaker. Is always dimming on it's own. (1) Their 3way switches are very poorly designed. And, I mean VERY poorly. They ONLY pair with \"dumb\" 3way switches. By \"dumb\" they mean toggle only non-powered switches. (2) They are not UL or ETL certified, so many electricians will not touch them. And, due to design flaws, these switches may be hazardous in your home. (3) They have a high amount of leakage on the common line. (as in can damage other items on the same breaker high.) Especially other TreatLife switches on the same circuit breaker. (up to 120V of High Current) (4) They do not work with all bulbs. In fact, they work with only a small number of bulbs. Don't count on those low wattage LED bulbs working. Now, they state lots of \"gotchas\" in their small print to get around the above. Like only 1 treatlife switch per breaker circuit (as if). And, will not work with Smart Bulbs (oh, and a whole long list of low wattage bulbs). That their 3ways are non-\"standard\" (as in they do not function to code). And so on. Sadly I spent 550$ in switches, and 1K plus trying to get electricians to help solve all the issues caused by these switches. In the end, I exceeded my return date while trying to get these switches to work. There customer service was \"responsive\", but not helpful. And, they strung me along until the return date was past, then they just disappeared. There are better alternatives out there (ie. like KASA switches both on Amazon and at Home Depot.)\n40#Only lasted 2 years. Only lasted 2 years . Switch and dimmer works this does not connect to Wi-Fi anymore have 10 in my house 7 have failed.\n41#Too sensitive. Anytime I turn the light on, the dimmer adjusts. I don‚Äôt even have to touch the dimmer bar. If you wave near it there will be an adjustment. Additionally it makes the ‚Äúdimmable‚Äù bulbs hiss and flicker on the lower settings. I will be trying something else.\n42#I love it. Great for when your on vacation\n43#Makes my home smart, but set up is dumb. There are only 3 cons for me with these dimmer switches, otherwise I love them and being able to dim the lights is a game changer, especially if you suffer from migraines or have an infant. Its compatible with Alexa and Google and works well. With adjustments the dimming can be low or high and there are 3 different moods, but there is only a slight difference. The cons: 1. Set up is a pain. It can sometimes be difficult to get them to pair with your smartphone. It's also not intuitive if you change wifi routers. You have to complete the process all over again with any changes. It would be better if the app connected to the wifi and then automatically connected the devices. 2. Your settings for the dimmers reset themselves and you will have to set it up again for each individual dimmer. It would be better if there was a way to set a preference for rooms and/or all dimmers. 3. There is no control for cybersecurity so someone could hack the lights and then potentially hack your system. They should have a feature allowing you to change the password for the devices.\n44#2 out of 4 work as expected. As stated in the title, we could only connect 2 properly. We took too long to install them and the return window closed. Frustrating but not surprising given the lower cost.\n45#Dimmers work wonderfully. Very simple to install as long as you can find the neutral wire buried in you box. Had the switch replaced in no time, however the spiderweb of extra electrical wires made locating the proper white neutral in the switch box tough. Once I did the switch functioned wonderfully, only negative I had was the switch only communicates over a 2.4ghz network and had some difficulty getting that to work, tweaked some network/Bluetooth settings on my phone and then it worked. Once I did however it synced with Alexa well and light its functioning as described. Will buy more in the future.\n46#Perfect for what I need, Great functionality! I don't have any cons aside from wishing the pack of 4 came with a few 2 switch plates too. But I understand it is a pack of 4 single switches. I installed this in less than 2 minutes and adding them to the app/to Alexa was rather simple. The dimming works well, I just have some cheap dimming bulbs from dollar general and plan to get better ones in the future when these burn out. I have a newborn and wanted these so I didn't have to leave him on the bed to mess with the lights. It works great.. Connecting them was simple and they fit on universal wall mounts with no problem!\n47#Zero stars ‚Äî stopped working after changing my wifi name. After changing my wifi network name, 70% of the TreatLife switches that I had (I had a mix of dimmers and on/off switches) failed to reconnect. I tried restarting my router, uninstalling/reinstalling the app, resetting each individual device, nothing worked. I reached out to customer service and got no response This garbage isn‚Äôt worth the box that it comes in\n48#Smart and beautiful. Like how it feels like phone touchscreen when adjusting light. And it can be controlled by app, with scheduling as well.\n49#Don't buy the 4 pack, chances are you can't use them. They only \"support\" 1 dimmer switch per circuit. From what I understand this is an issue with all dimmers not just this brand and not just smart dimmers. Under 2000 square foot homes usually only have all their lights on two circuits. Which means you might only be able to use two. This is because when they wire lights in series one dimmer switch will cause the lights on another dimmer switch to flicker, basically it back feeds power and flickers brighter than it should be. This product either should be removed or add an obvious disclaimer next to the \"neutral is required\". Cause chances are you will install one or two and then have issues with the rest and who is gonna uninstall them to get a refund.",
