So far so good. Easy to install.\n1#Worth the money, very good quality. The product is really high quality, and it feels really sturdy. It also has a nice feel to the switch it self, and looks very sleek. Easy to install and worth the price\n2#Gracias muy Bueno. Gracias muy Bueno\n3#La calidad. Buena el material\n4#Light switches. They seem to working fine. Easy to install just make sure to turn the power off first. Safety fist\n5#Nice spec grade switch with cover. Wall plate is included which is nice. It’s actually spec grade that you don’t need the J hook. Will buy again if needed.\n6#Squeaky. I guess you get what you pay for. Test them before you install. They squeak when pushed. I would not recommend and will be returning them.\n7#Great buy. Easy to install and they look great. Highly recommend them.\n8#Quality product. Work as expected\n9#Price was right. Item as described and would purchase again!\n10#Los mejores. Sin duda algunna que interruptores tan bonitos me encanta el toque de luz que tiene eleva demasiado el producto y hace que mi casa luzca super moderna y bonita y son de super buena calidad, sin duda alguna remplazare todos los de mi casa por este modelo\n11#Yeah. Perfect fit\n12#Perfect! Great price for the product. Exactly what expected\n13#Fit and finish. Re did all my house original light switches\n14#Great value. Great value, nice feeling switch.\n15#Nice switches for the price! I had no trouble installing these as replacements for a remodel. They have a nice soft operation that is smooth and quiet.\n16#No complains. Great value for money\n17#These are great. Easy to install and they look good. I am very happy with them.\n18#Works. Installed these this summer, replacing ones that had cracked. Works and looks good\n19#Decent little light switch. Bought these as I’m redoing my girls bedrooms. Work as intended. Only complaint is the cheap cover. I normally buy a larger plate anyways.\n20#Worked great. After having to install a switch mount. As a modular home does have typical switch mounts. After installing the mount and the switch. It worked perfectly\n21#Good Quality. Great price\n22#Excelente calidad. Súper moderno\n23#Excellent A++++. Love the way it looks thanks\n24#Reasonable price for the lot. Changed out the old stick light switches at my family home, couple of which were at least 50 years old. Aside from some minor modifications to allow the decorator plates to be screwed on two old metal electrical switch outlet boxes embedded in the concrete wall, the rest of the installation went smoothly.\n25#Not perfect but these work. I needed a lot of swthcces so I shopped around for price. These were the cheapest. And you can tell. They work, but the spring inside is loud. It does nothing to its functionality so far, but it can be annoying at night.\n26#Upgrade light switch. Worked as advertised\n27#Love Them!! I love how they look and feel! Really made it alot easier to switch on lights and label others!\n28#Works as expected and good value. The light switches were easy to install. We did it on our own and it was relatively simple. The cost was much less than other name brands. As compared to our other existing rocker switches, the downside of these is that the rocker clicks quite loudly when pressing on/off.\n29#Decepcionada . Dos de los interruptores de luz no servian , hicieron corte en mi casa .\n30#Faceplate doesnt match the switch. might return. they're great but the color doesn't match. might return. Maybe customer service will make it right\n31#Great decor switches. Good merchandise even better price\n32#good quality. such a nice quality and good price\n33#Light Switch. Looks great on the wall\n34#It just works and was easy to install. All that you need to install it except obviously a screwdriver and electrical tape is included.\n35#Perfect offer. All the job is done in a very convenient price. Very good quality. Easy to install.\n36#Easy to install , works great so far. Very easy to install and works as intended. I only wish that it wasn’t only single switches but had option to have one or two double and one triple switch.\n37#Perfect size and good set. Great quantity in this set. I used it to remove switches with timers the previous owner installed which kept going off at random times and I wasn’t able to edit the time. Comes with its own wall plate or you can use yours. I have a lot left over for future moves so I’m very happy",
