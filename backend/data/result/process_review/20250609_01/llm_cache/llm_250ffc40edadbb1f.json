Love these dimmers\n1#Easy to control and much better light quality in the room. I have 4 of these in my home, and with dimmable LED bulbs I get the brightness and quality I like at all times. Easy to install, and control.\n2#Been 6 months and working fine. Works perfect. The only thing I don't like is having to hold the button so long when you want the light to go 1/2 way on..\n3#Scratched item. Item is scratched, I need to return it but don’t see how to do this.\n4#Exactly what I need to dim incandescent & LED in kitchen! Was replacing a broken one made for incandescent only. This was a perfect replacement and works great. By the way, press them. Don’t slap at those paddle switches. Don’t ask me how I know :-)\n5#Dimmer. Great product.. works perfect\n6#Switch is BIG - not easy to get into the wall box. I had a string of can lights with BR30 bulbs, mixed CFL and LED, with a 3-way switch, and they were just too bright so I wanted to reduce the brightness. This device claimed to do just what I needed and had good reviews, so I ordered one. Long run, the instructions were good enough, and the switch did just what I needed - 5 stars to start, but… The switch is HUGE behind the faceplate, like 4 times the size of a simple switch, and has little metal heat sink fins on the sides that can interfere with adjacent switches; the fins can be removed but that means capacity is derated. The size makes getting the switch wired and into the box very difficult. 5-1=4 stars Not only is the switch big, it uses 4 wire pigtails instead of screw terminals so you have to use wire nuts to connect it, which makes getting it in the box even more difficult. 4-1=3 stars And the wire nuts aren’t included. I know how to use them and have a bunch around the house so that wasn’t a problem for me but for some this will be a problem. 3-1=2 stars. In hind sight, some Wago Lever Nuts (available on Amazon) would probably work better, but I would prefer normal screw connectors. First try - worked but didn’t dim very far, and some of the lights started buzzing. Maybe that’s my bulbs - the LEDs are marked as dimmable, but I have no idea about the old CFLs. Second try - I bought a complete new set of dimmable LED BR20 bulbs and installed those - no buzzing, dims to almost no light, just what I wanted. Shame it was so hard to install.\n7#Works as expected. 3 way dimmers are a little more complicated to install than normal dimmers. This dimmer comes with instructions so if you know how to install switches you will have no problems.\n8#Works great! Second one we purchased. Easy to install, works very well.\n9#Nice product. Nice product\n10#Product as advertised. Instructions were not helpful. Fortunately, there are 3 wires plus a ground which results in limited choices for installation. Product was more expenses than competitors. Time will tell if it was worth it. Product works as advertised and matches existing switches in same location.\n11#Love this line of Lutron switches/dimmers/receptacles. Love this line of Lutron switches/dimmers/receptacles. I changed all of the switches and receptacles in the house to match, the matte finish in color biscuit is classic, elegant and elevates the rooms.\n12#Stylish, functional units for most kinds of modern bulbs. Color is a good match for our walls and the plates don't show screw heads, which improves appearance. Wish all dimmers were back lit though they do work well. Important to chose carefully.\n13#One of them wasn’t working at all. One of them wasn’t working I bought 2\n14#Five Stars. I like the switch it works perfectly",
