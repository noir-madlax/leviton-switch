I'm having issues connecting with the Kasa app on my Pixel 9. I downloaded the app on my MacBook Air and that works perfectly. I have seen more reviews complaining about connection issues on their phones. The switch works great.\n1#Not for 90’s houses. Not really what I thought it would be. Pretty disappointed with the performance and connectivity.\n2#Simply Put, They Don't Work. I followed the product's instructions to the letter with installation. The product itself tells you if you did the wiring correctly and the switch light confirmed I had it wired it correctly. Then, in order for the switch to work, you have to pair it on your phone using their app. I downloaded the app, followed all instructions, and it wouldn't pair. I tried several times with my Android phone, no luck, then I downloaded the app on my wife's iphone. Still the app would not pair with either phone. Then, as advised I went to the website to troubleshoot, but there is no troubleshooting on the website. Only descriptions of why the product is so wonderful. The problem is there is no option to skip smart installation which I didn't need. So if it doesn't pair with their OWN APPLICATION, the product doesn't work at all. After wasting more than an hour, I had to undo all of the wiring and I repackaged and returned the product. As it says in the title, it doesn't work with either Android or iphone.\n3#Network issues galore! Beware. These are terrible switches. I attempted to update the WiFi settings for a new network, but most of the kasa switches won't connect to the new network. It's not a user issue, I have these throughout my house and set them up originally with issue. But changing the network breaks them. Either will never connect or connect for a short period only. And now I have 2, that I never tried to switch the network on suddenly lose the WiFi connection and won't reconnect. I've tried resetting and every work around, but they never get connected to my home network. I've installed dozens of these and ultimately they're a poorly designed product if you can't change network settings or if they can't stay connected. Don't recommend KASA at all now.\n4#Easy installation. These work great.\n5#Excellent Smart Switch. Switch was installed by an electrician. It was very easy to integrate with the Kasa app. Turning switch on/off and using the dimmer either at the switch or in the app is easy.\n6#Worked well. These work Very well. Very happy with the Kasa (TP-Link) brand. Was easy to setup. No issues with connectivity.\n7#Good Deal. Reliable. Hopefully the old wiring was done correctly so it'll be an easy job. Just make sure you do what other reviewers warn, and be sure yo do have that neutral wire installed. And hope the guy who did the prior wiring did it right. Because replacing three way dumb switches with a smart one is a lot easier if the person who put the dumb switch in wasn't like the switch. And I have had good success with TP Link switches. They work well and not had a dud yet. Thought I did once, but turned out to be the wiring from the guy before me.\n8#These are the way to go for smart lighting control. We've used a variety of 'smart devices' throughout our house including smart bulbs. By far, the most reliable method of controlling lights are with these Kasa switches. They're easy to set up, easy to manage, work with Google or Alexa voice commands, operate nicely when using them manually, and are easy to install as long as you have a neutral wire which they require. Our house is older and needed to have neutral wires run to the switches which required we have an electrician assist. Despite the additional cost, it was well worth it. We will have more of these installed shortly so that we can set schedules for when lights should come on when we're out of the house or on vacation, easily dim lights to any desired brightness, and control everything from our phone or tablet from thousands of miles away.\n9#Faulty products. Bought Kasa smart switches for every light switch in my home, including several of these 3-way dimmer kits. I hired an electrician to install everything and the first 2 sets of the 3 way switches I had him install didn’t work. I had purchased them more than 30 days beforehand so they were unable to to returned. So I bought two more and hired the electricians for a return visit, and those two kits didn’t work. My home is a new build no there were no wiring issues causing any of these problems and to verify, I had the electrician uninstall one of the Kasa Smart 3 way sets that worked and had them install it on the switches where the repurchased sets were not working. The set worked so we knew the wiring wasn’t at fault. So now I’m needing to try a 3rd time as I don’t want to need multiple apps to control my home’s smart switches! So frustrating and expensive to have to keep hiring electricians because a products is faulty!\n10#Great for the price. Works without issue\n11#Couldn’t get it working with professional help. I have tried to install these in my house twice along with an electrician and an electrical engineer. We could not get them to work properly in my house at all. Maybe I have some kind of unique wiring we couldn’t figure out. Or maybe it’s just a finicky product trying to automate a difficult circuit.\n12#Perfect! Works perfectly! Wonderful product. I filed around with the Amazon Basic 3 way switch for 2 days. Got the smart switch to work after having to require the regular 3 way to bring power to the smart switch. Then the regular 3 way switch worked, but had to shut it off twice. I gave up. Ordered this Kasa and it came first thing the next morning. Installed both switches in 10 minutes, it automatically connected to Alexa because I already have a Kasa camera connected to Alexa. Renamed it in Alexa and bingo, perfect functionality! Connected switch 1 (main) to the switch that had the line in direct to breaker box. Connected switch 2 to the switch that has the load line going to the light.\n13#Goood. Works great but make sure the ground wire is connected\n14#Smart 3 way dimmer kit. They work great, easy to setup, programming in the app is awesome. Day night settings that are totally customizable. Can be trained to trigger lightning off cameras and voice troll through Alexa.\n15#Poor cusomter service. Two Kasa switches have failed when controlling the same ceiling lights. I sought advice from TP Link techical support. I did not receive any technical support at all. Instread, I was required to wait on hold on a customer support line for a very long time and then respond to a series of confusing and poorly worded emails. I was not seeking a replacement although I do need one. Since this is the second Kasa device that has failed for these lights, I wanted some technical advice about why this might be happening. I have spent some considerable time on the phone and responding to emails but I have been unable to obtain any technical advice about what might be going on here. Very frustrating and time-wasting. I realize that I am just one customer out of millions and so have no significance to Kasa, But it is not nice to be treated in this way.\n16#Bit complicated to install. Bit complicated to install. Luckily my electrician did some trial and error and managed to get it installed. Other than that, happy with product. Hope it lasts long and not like some Chinese brands.\n17#Good product BUT BE SURE the three way box with the line (always hot) also has a neutral. Product is great, but in order to operate, BE SURE IN YOUR BOX you not only have a neutral wire (usually white, wired together and bunched in the back of the box) you also need your line (always hot wire, usually single black wire) wire in the same box as the neutral. In my home, I have several three way switches and only one of my boxes had the line wire and neutral. The rest had a neutral with the load (line to the lights) not the line, so had to return.\n18#Have you heard of Quality Control? Bought 2 of these and neither work. 1 won’t power on, the other won’t connect to app. I’ll be buying a competitors product next since 100% of the shipped items don’t work.\n19#Nice kit for total control of your lights. Installed, I am very happy with the switches and their features. If you have installed smart switches before, watch the orientation of the switches. Most require the primary to be on the light side. With the KS230 kit, the opposite is true. The satellite needs to have the load going to the light, and the main has the load going to the main power. Once this is done, installation is simple, and the switches are easy to setup on the KASA app as a single unit. In a bedroom, it is nice having the ring LED's programmable as on or off when the lights are off. When first installed the lights would go off at 40%, but you simply go to Settings and Dimming Calibration, and the entire range is made available for smooth dimming and Alexa can control the entire range. Fade on and fade speed off can be set differently.\n20#Not compatible with LED lighting. Did not work with my led lighting.\n21#Perfect 3 Way Smart Dimmer. Perfect 3 way dimmer switch set (Main unit and satellite unit). Easy install and setup.\n22#Stylish and very capable upgrade. Easy way to upgrade to IOT control. Works well. Very easy instal. But you do need a Neutral (usually white) to wire in one of the switch locations. The secondary switch does not need one. The instructions are very clear and the kit includes labels for the wires as you uninstall the old switches. Really like the slow off of the switch. Also you can control the dimming from either switch. Finally like being able to use the app to control the switches too.\n23#Would recommend. Was a gift. Recipient loved it\n24#Very good switches and good customer service as well. I just installed two of these switches and they look great. Also, the instructions where the best instructions I have seen on any of the 3 way smart switches I have purchased before. They worked perfectly as soon as installed. However, I had an issue getting them added to the app. I just on a chat with a TP-Link support agent named Kristine Mae. She quickly gave me a number of things to try and fix the issue. Very quickly it did resolve the problem and I got them added into the app. They have worked very well ever since.\n25#Good 3 way smart swicth. Works as advertised. Easy to install (first time doing a 3 way smart switch). Connect easily via wifi to the app with my other Kasa switches, bulbs and plugs. It would be nice if both switches had the little lights on them to show the dimmer level, but otherwise highly recommended.\n26#Not 3 way. Be cautious when ordering this. The switches I received were not 3 way compatible. The description on these states that they are 3 way compatible. Went to a job to install them just to end up having to go to Home Depot.\n27#Bad switches. Lasted less than a year, lights turned on and off randomly then one switch would not stay off for more than 30 seconds before turning itself back on. I was on vacation and monitored it through my phone. Finally I had a neighbor go into the house and unscrew the lightbulb!\n28#Cool hardware. Confoozeling software. The installation is straightforward. Deciding which of the multiple software apps to use is not.\n29#Used Switch in New Box. Bought So many 3 Way Kasa light in the past. This time I got already used switch with wires on it and 2 out of 3 Kasa 3 way dimmer were used one and didnt work. Don’t Recommend BUYING FROM THIS SELLER AT ALL!!!!!\n30#Great switches. Outstanding functionality. Works great with Alexa. Love the Kasa app.\n31#Don’t buy Amazon Resale items. This is more about Amazon. The item was only available as used / like new. The item was in very used condition. It was just stuffed back in the box. It was missing the screws and wire caps. It also had screws and other items that must have been from the previous buyers old light switches. The item was obviously not inspected before being re-sold. The worst thing of all is that after paying an electrician to install the switches they were defective and did not work.\n32#Works like magic for retro-fitting. Absolutely fantastic. Solve my problem that I don't have neutral at satellite place. Fabulous for retro-fitting in old houses\n33#Super easy install. Just follow directions. These are amazing. I did my whole upstairs main living areas. Kitchen living room laundry and hall and fireplace and LR FAN. No bedrooms but I may do them eventually. Didn't make sense to do them as I don't need to use alexa on them like in the kitchen and living room or whatever. We have a 4 year old home that we built so all the wiring is updated if how these hook up. Super easy to do. Just follow instructions. And I'm not an electrician. Don't need one. Common sense says turn off your correct fuses in the box. These are my favorite. I whet with kasa because of the price point and works with alexa. Which there are many that do.\n34#Thank you Glenn. The instructions for connecting with your home network leave out some critical steps. Glenn at customer service is superb!!! He guided me through the steps including me back on a different phone so that I could complete the setup on the phone I was using which lost connection on a previous call when I connected with the TP network. Just one of a number of setup issues. If u have any issues zi hope u get Glenn to help you. I’ve set up 3 additional switches on my own since. Easy once you know how to thank you Glenn.\n35#Work great and look nice. Work great and function with home assistant. Just be aware if installing in multigang box that some plates won't work as well as others.\n36#I'll buy these for any light going forward! I have these set up for about 10 of my lights now. I LOVE coming home to some lights on. The timers are so great and the dimming is awesome because it can be adjusted along with the timer. I don't love bright lights so this was a critical feature. The price isn't much more than an average dimmer too!\n37#Great 3 way switch. Easy to install and setup if you have some electrical knowledge\n38#Love kasa! Great devices from kasa automation!\n39#Hard to install if line and load in same junction box. I'm pretty good with electrical stuff and this took a lot of thought. My line and load were in same box but these switches call for them in separate boxes. They don't have a common like traditional 3-ways. My house had a 14-3 running between boxes. I connected black wire between boxes to load on satellite switch and to the black wire from light(load) in main switch box and tucked it to the back of the box. I used white and red wires between boxes as travelers between switches. (Simple to install once I figured out the workaround.)\n40#The Secret Superpower Every Parent Needs. Installing the Kasa Smart 3-Way Dimmer Switch has been a total game-changer—especially as a parent. If you have kids who constantly leave the lights on, this is a must-have. ✔ Ultimate Convenience – I installed these in the basement, and now I don’t have to trek downstairs every night just to turn off the lights the kids left on. I just tap my phone, and done. ✔ Dimming & Remote Control – Whether I want to set the mood for movie night or just turn the lights off from bed, the app makes it effortless. ✔ Reliable Wi-Fi Connection – No hub required, and they’ve stayed connected without issue. ✔ E-Z setup – It takes just a few minutes per switch and then is typically coupled with an update (switches need firmware updates? What a brave new world..). Then you're good to go. Honestly, once you have one, you’ll want more. These are the kind of smart home upgrades that feel like a superpower. Highly recommend!\n41#Great service from customer service person Honie. Support staff person Honie was great! She got my wifi switch up and running in no time when I was having some trouble with the instruction.\n42#Requires troubleshooting with Kasa when product fails. These work great—until they don't. Then, you have to be able to handle the wiring yourself or hire an electrician because you have to troubleshoot with Kasa before they will send you a replacement. And they will not give your money back. I bought a new switch because that was cheaper than hiring an electrician to talk to Kasa. It's a brilliant working model for Kasa. She says sarcastically.\n43#Easy Install and Setup. First of all. You will need to have a neutral wire in the switch box to provide some low voltage, constant power to this switch, or it will not work. Do not use the work around either that you can find on YouTube or you could fry your main panel outside. If you are good to go with a neutral wire, these things are AWESOME!!! Works with Alexa and the Kasa App. If you don't have a neutral switch, you'll need to buy a more expensive wi-fi switch that typically cost around $60 each.\n44#Defective and terrible customer setvice. After hiring 2 separate electricians to install these switches, we determined they were defective. I contacted TP Link and got the run around for another month. They won't refund, and will only send me a replacement set if I pay for shipping. I do not recommend this product. Nothing but lots of wasted time and money.\n45#Awesome. Works as intended.\n46#Remote control using Alexa. Perfect for turning the kitchen lights off from the live Ng room using alexa",
