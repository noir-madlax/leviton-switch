The durability is a big issue, after replacing the broken HS200 within one year, it broken again… considering moving back to traditional switch since all the other switches last forever without a problem, but I’ve replaced the smart switches the third time already…\n1#TP-Link Smart Switches Are Garbage – Built to Break, Total Scam. I've bought 12 TP-Link smart light switches over the past 3-4 years. Two weeks ago, one just stopped working. I figured, okay, stuff happens. But then—boom—another one dies the following week. The day after that? A third one goes out. That’s three failures in under two weeks. Out of curiosity, I checked TP-Link’s website. Surprise, surprise: the warranty is only 1–2 years. Guess what? All three failed right after the warranty expired. These things aren’t defective — they’re engineered to fail once you’re no longer covered. That’s not a coincidence. That’s a planned-obsolescence scam. These smart switches are not “smart”—they’re a stupid waste of money. Regular light switches last 10–20 years, while these overpriced plastic toys can’t even last two. DO NOT BUY these switches. I don’t care how fancy the app is or what brand it is — TP-Link or otherwise. If it needs replacing every couple of years, it’s trash. Stick with old-school switches. They’re cheap, reliable, and they don’t leave you in the dark — literally.\n2#one-letter difference in the model number would make it incompatible with smartphone control. I didn’t realize a one-letter difference in the model number would make such a big difference. I bought the HS200, but it turns out it doesn’t work with HomeHub or support voice control. Only the KS200 model is compatible. Now I have to buy the correct one again — very frustrating!\n3#Good for low-current circuits, but prone to failure after a few months on higher current circuits. These are pretty rad for the price, but the 15a rating is bogus. I've had two of these fail on the same circuit in my garage for the ceiling lighting in there. I can only conclude that the relay's not handling the higher current of this set of lights. They've been totally reliable for other light duty applications.\n4#Easy install, but horrible when they fail with no customer support. These switches worked well for a few years after purchase. I liked the simplicity of install and the fact that no hub was required so installed many of them throughout our house. ~3 years later, all of the switches are failing one by one. They fail in a mode that just switches on and off repeatedly meaning I can’t just fix it later and replace the switch when it’s convenient, unless I’m ok with a light (or worse depending on the load controlled) flashing incessantly on and off and the sound of a relay clicking every second. TP link provided no support when contacted the first few times, just provided boilerplate troubleshooting before they said it can’t be fixed, and told me they’re out of warranty (it’s only 2 years so true but irritating) so I just need to replace them. I’m now proactively ripping all of these out of my house, giving away or disposing of the uninstalled extras, and will go with a more reliable brand next time. Sometimes the easy solution is definitely the wrong one, and this has tainted TP-Link’s reputation for me and will avoid them in the future.\n5#Don’t buy 3 pack!! Works great but one didn’t work and the return process is long and hard. So just buy one at a time. The three pack is a scam. I have 5 that work but one of the 3 pack didn’t. Then they want you to jump thru hoops to replace it.\n6#It’s working. Working well\n7#Excellent quality. Great quality\n8#You get what you pay for. The light on the front of the switches to tell if they are on and off is very dim. When the room lights are on you are not able to see the light on any of the switches. Even the ones that are off. The lights do not match either. If you put switches next to each other the light brightness in the switch button is different for each switch. Makes them look cheap. One has gone bad already too.\n9#Incredibly good quality, work perfectly. If I could rate these 10 out of 5 stars I would. Have ordered so many of these that I should buy stock in this company. Love these switches - they work perfectly with Alexa, never fail, never drop out, are so easy to install, they’re amazing. These increase your home value exponentially. I can’t commend these enough - probably one of the best products I’ve ever bought on Amazon\n10#Integrated with Alexa. You can use the app or ask Alexa to turn the light on and off. We have these in several rooms and they’re great. Only downfall is they don’t work on multi switch lights\n11#Love it. Extremely well built. Excellent choice and will keep buying more… I’m for my 7th. Want to replace all my new ones but not smart. Works perfectly with my Alexa.\n12#Smart, Stylish, and Reliable – Great Upgrade. One of the best smart home purchases I’ve made recently. The Kasa Smart Switch is stylish, responsive, and adds real convenience to my setup. Just a heads-up: you’ll need to make sure your home has a neutral wire for installation. Once installed, it works flawlessly and definitely enhances the smart home experience.\n13#Operation of switches. Great product took some time to connect but very nice operation\n14#Excelente muy bueno. Esta excelente\n15#Super classy. super easy to install, and had no trouble setting up the app or anything.\n16#TP-Link, work on the durability of these switches. 3 out of 6 of the switches I purchsed on Amazon stopped working after about a year and a half. Restarting, resetting, changing networks, nothing works. These are just pieces of junks now. The keep blinking really fast, along with switching on and off several times per second. Almost feels like company may be bricking these OTA to make you buy new ones.\n17#My new favorite light switches. Ties into google home and home assistant very nicely. Highly recommend if you don't use a zigbee system\n18#Do your research before buying. Had a power outage causing these switches to become disabled. Tried resetting them with no luck. Contacted KASA and gave them my concerns, which replied with no direct response on how to correct the issue. Do a little more research when purchasing.\n19#stopped working after 1 year. Seems to be a common issue. Not reliable. worked fine for about a year, and suddenly it stopped working. The light stays on even when I turn it off. Did a quick web search, and it seems to be a common problem with this product. Basically, it suddenly stops working, and light stays on, even though I hear clicking sound from the switch, and also the indicator light turns on and off. It's just that the internal switch is defective and stops working. I had a spare; so, I replaced it with the spare, and it worked right away. It was good while it lasted, and the price is cheap, but lifetime of 1.5 years? I'm not sure I want to deal with electrical wiring so often. The product is definitely not durable. Luckily the product is under warranty of 2 years. Let's see how good their support is.\n20#Smart Switches That Instantly Upgrade Your Home. The Kasa Smart Light Switch (HS200P3) is one of those small upgrades that makes a huge difference. After moving into our new home from a place where we had these installed, I didn’t even think twice—I ordered a couple 3-pack right away. These switches are that good. Once you’ve lived with smart switches like this, it’s genuinely hard to go back to flipping lights on and off manually. They integrate beautifully with Alexa, making it easy to control your lights with a simple voice command. Whether I’m settling in to watch a movie or getting ready for bed, not having to get up to hit a switch is a luxury I didn’t know I needed—until I had it. While these don’t have dimming capabilities, they still deliver a top-tier smart home experience with reliable performance, remote access through the Kasa app, scheduling, and seamless voice control. And honestly, for most rooms, just having on/off control from anywhere is a total win. Super easy to install (as long as you have a neutral wire), and they look sleek on the wall. If you’re starting or expanding your smart home setup, this is one of the best bang-for-your-buck upgrades out there.\n21#Not a good buy at all! Not a good buy. I tried Wemo and they consistently failed. I then bought over 6 of these, installed them they worked fine until I changed my router and now they will not detect the 2.4ghz. Wasted money for what I intended them to be used for.\n22#Does not work. Unable to program it. Also unable to get any support. Waste of money\n23#Easy to connect to the app for controlling it. Works nice and easy to set up in the app. Have other Kasa plugs that I love.\n24#Easy. Works great and easy to set up.\n25#Unreliable product; wont last a year. Product fails after few months of installation; suddenly starts flickering\n26#Switch wears out and sticks on/off after a few months. Not a fan anymore. There's something wrong internally with the switch and I've had two so far. The switch after a couple of months is stuck on and will not turn off or is stuck off and will not turn on manually or automatically. I tried to get customer support on this and they basically don't offer anything and push you into just buying another one. I did that and the new one did the exact same thing about a month later. Won't buy another.\n27#Junk. Junk. Installed correctly, connected to the app and all that. Did not work at all. Even tried installing at a different spot, didn’t work. Would not recommend\n28#Avoid - Failed after 2 years use. Go with a better quality brand. Barely lasted 2 years and has failed. Circle Light and WIFI symbol light on switch blinks rapidly and clicks. Holding reset or trying to use the restart button do nothing. Contacted TP-Link for warranty replacement. They refused to replace it because my purchase date was 1 month past the 2 year warranty. I would expect this switch to last more than a couple years. I have other smart devices in my home for much longer. If your considering buying these switches, don't.\n29#Functionality. Works flawlessly\n30#Worked fine for 3.5 years and then broke. This single pole switch worked flawlessly for 3.5 years and one day started clicking repeatedly, switching the circuit on and off rapidly. Installed indoors. If you research it, it happens to a lot of people with this model.\n31#Great while it lasted…. Need replacing after 4 years! Great when they work but lifespan is rather limited. 2nd switch has burnt out after 4 years … i don’t even use the switch that much since its automated!\n32#Laggy and unreliable. I’ve been using Kasa smart switches and the Deco TP-Link A5400 mesh WiFi for over two years, and overall, I’m extremely disappointed. Despite both products being from the same brand, the Kasa app is consistently laggy, slow, and unreliable. Even with a strong network connection, the app struggles to respond, making smart home control frustrating. The biggest issue is connectivity. The Deco A5400 mesh system itself has been unstable, frequently dropping connections or failing to properly integrate with Kasa devices. I’ve tried every troubleshooting method—resetting, repositioning nodes, firmware updates—but nothing has provided a long-term fix. To make matters worse, Google Home integration is unreliable at best, with devices often appearing offline or responding inconsistently to voice commands. For a smart home ecosystem, reliability is crucial, and TP-Link has not delivered. If you’re looking for a seamless smart switch and mesh WiFi combination, I’d strongly recommend looking at other brands.\n33#Reliable and Easy to Use. We keep coming back to this brand because it's so easy to install and use. We even have them outside for our patio and bbq. It syncs up well with Alexa making it super simple to control lights inside and outside the house.\n34#Don’t buy used like new unless you have spare parts. Purchased like new product. Missing all screws and wire nuts so it make it harder to install when I have to buy the rest of the parts.\n35#Good switch but not compatible with Homekit. I bought these switches because I am so pleased with Kasa Ep25 plugs. These Kasa switches are compatible with Alexa which is great, but not Apple HomeKit, which is odd because the plugs are. The Kasa plugs are very reliable. I hope these switches are as well.\n36#Very well done. Easy to install, works great.\n37#Defective. This is the 3rd time i bought this light switch. After about a year it starts turning on and off continuously. The wifi lights up red and does not stop\n38#Bad Lot?? I bought a total of four switches. One three pack (this item), had them installed and not one worked. I also bought one switch in a single pack. It worked. I am now buying three more switches but this time I’m buying singles!\n39#Happy with purchase. I installed this smart switch to control my front porch light. Set to come on at sunset and off at sunrise. Works great,\n40#Not dimmable. Amazon rejected my review. This product is not dimmable as implied by the picture\n41#I love these switches! I love these switches! Easy to install and customer support is easy to obtain via phone, talking to a real person who was knowledgeable and provided above and beyond customer support. And if you have Amazon Alexa, she easily and quickly supports the switches. I have three switches and will buy more.\n42#Excelente. Muy bien producto\n43#So convenient. After installing, easy setup and easy to set schedules.\n44#Average. The dimmer steps are not really equal as you may think when you increase it and decrease it. Not the greatest feedback as well.\n45#Customer Service came through in a pinch. I had difficulty in the setup of one of three switches and customer service did a great job of successfully connecting to my router.\n46#Holy cow tplink is likely the worst company I have ever dealt with on a warranty. We have several of these switches and in tplink/kasa defence we have only had problems with 1 of them. That being said I will likely never purchase another tplink product due to the hassles of 1 $13.00 switch warranty. I spent an hour on a chat trouble shooting a swich that was obviously bad and providing receipts, photos, etc. The switch worked fine for 2 weeks and then stuck on and we could not turn the light off. Now I have an email asking for all the same information and informing me they may not cover it. Argh!\n47#Great cheap wifi smart switch. I have many of these all over my house and they have been super reliable for years! They connect without any issues to Alexa and Home Assistant. On/off time is almost instant and I haven't had any problems with them at all.",
