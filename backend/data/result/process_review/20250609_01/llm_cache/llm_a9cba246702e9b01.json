It worked fairly well for about 3 years. Today I tried to turn the switch on and it didn't work. The physical buttons failed, I can still turn it on through ZWave. Factory reset didn't fix it. Time to find a better brand. Also worth noting: Some features of this dimmer aren't supported by Home Assistant/ZWaveJS. For example, even though the zwave parameters show up in ZWaveJS, changing the LED indicator color doesn't work.\n1#LEDs flicker. Flickers. Thought maybe it was the lights so I changed the switch out, but it stopped with a different switch. Guess I should have stuck with normal brands and not cheaped out.\n2#flashes LED lights. The 3-way dimmer works, but the LED lights flash when on brightest setting.\n3#Not compatible with all LED lights. I installed these to control 5 HALO HLB4 lights from Home Depot. Everything seems fine but every once in a while the lights flicker. Sometimes just a blink but other times for a few seconds. It is very annoying and impossible to work full time with the flickering. The troubleshooting guide does not really help and this brand is not in the HALO list of compatible dimmers… I guess I should have checked there first but I only found the list after installing these dimmer.\n4#Slow dim, can't switch on/off instantly. Wiring and adding to hubitat was really easy. there were good configuration options for turning off the blue light(which is way too bright). it lets you configure dimming speed but the best it can do is \"ASAP\". so theres no instant on/off when clicking the button. it always has to dim up/down to the on off position. returning some of these that i didn't want for dimming\n5#This one was a refurb. I often buy Amazon refurbished to save a few dollars, especially when listed \"as new\". This one was a total dud; I'm sure Amazon had no way to test it, and it looked good. But as usual, Amazon is wonderful at returns.\n6#Works great with my Smartthings hub. Works great with my Smartthings hub. Had to replace an 5 year old GE smart switch. Hope this one last longer. Have had troubles with older GE smart switches and hopefully I have found a good replacement brand.\n7#Failed After 2 Months. I purchased two of these Z-Wave switches in July 2024 when my old switch suddenly started to flicker the lights and couldn't be turned on to full power or turned off, either manually or through my Z-Wave controller. This switch worked fine until September 2024 when it failed in the same way as the old switch. The difference is that the old switch was 9 years old before it failed. There are also two other similar switches in the same box on the same circuit controlling different lights. They are also old and work perfectly, so it's not a problem with the circuit or the box. I replaced the switch with the second one that I bought as a spare in July. We'll have to see how long this one lasts.\n8#Broke After 1 Year. It stopped talking to the Z-wave hub and I can’t do anything to make it work again. Pair. Unpair. Delete. Nothing! Frustrating. I bought two of these and the other is still working as well as all of my other z-wave switches. Then I tried to contact their support but the link is dead (no such page).\n9#Constant annoying flicker. It doesn’t seem to matter if the lights are 100% or dimmed. There is a super annoying flicker. Garbage.\n10#Worst switch ever encountered. I’m an electrician. And first of all I’m a bit confused how I’m ready the reviews saying they were able to connect switch with ease to the network. I can not not get the actual app to work at all. But Alexa picks it up but it still will not work. This is trash and another imitation switch. I hate and can not stand bs companies. Just all about the dollar. Even your instructions are wrong and telling you to do things that the switch is completely un able to do. Waste of time and money. I couldn’t even throw this switch far enough down the street to please me. Shame on you !!\n11#Quit working. Switch quit working after just over a year\n12#Used switch sent, scratched no screws or directions. Opened the taped box and saw that the switch looked used. No screws, all scratched up and no directions. Unfortunately was working on a home project and passed the return deadline by 11 days. Will attempt to install if I can find directions online somewhere. Poor quality control!\n13#Perfect with Smartthings. Have a few of these now in our house... works well and seems to be of good quality.\n14#Excellent z-wave switch. I've purchased a couple of these, they are straight forward to install and add to a Smartthings home using z-wave.\n15#Wrong switch sent. Switch sent wasn’t even the Jasco Ultra Pro. It was a Zooz without a pair button and the dimmer didn’t work. Would not connect to my zwave hub. No option to replace. So now I’m returning and reordering. What a waste of time\n16#3 Months of service and now dead. No \"Get Product Support\" available with this seller. Lovely, another product that lasted just past the return window. Bought two of these in mid Feb. This was the later install, likely mid March. So one is still working, and the other lasted 10 weeks. 2-year warranty...pshhh. We'll see.\n17#Works, but please read if you are thinking about a 3 way installation. Unlike other smart switches (like iNovelli) if you are thinking about a 3 way installation you cannot use this with a dumb switch. Its not very clear about that. There are other 3 way smart switches that you can pair with a dumb switch.. If you are using it for a standalone application, its a reasonably priced option.\n18#Comparable zwave dimmer. I want to rate this higher, but there are a few issues. First, the good. it has decent instructions and comes with a neutral jumper wire in the box. it doesn't take a lot of space compared to some zwave switches in the box. It looks good, although it's a bit brighter white than some of my other switches. I had to reset it before it would pair with my smartthings hub. Once I did that, it worked right away. The biggest issue with this product is that it's range of dimming isn't friendly with many LEDs. When shutting it off, it tries to dim down and that causes flickering. It also seems to flicker in the 30% range with my fixture quite badly. LEDs are extremely common now and some of the newer wifi based smart dimmers let you calibrate a dimming range. This switch does not have such a feature. I feel like if it let me limit dimming between 100-50% it would be fine.\n19#Was great till it wasn’t……. Install was very easy. Worked great for about a year then up and died. Many of my other Z-wave switches are going on 8 years with no problems. Very disappointed in the lifespan.\n20#Professional Look. As advertised.\n21#Single switch diagram wrong. The double switch diagram shows neutral connected to the switch. The single switch diagram does NOT show it connected. Support person refused to acknowledge that the diagram is incorrect but did insist it needed to be connected which is correct. Could not understand their refusal. Other than that switch works fine so far with Habitat hub.\n22#Fades to off, no option to change. I was very disappointed to discover that the dimmer fades slowly to off with no option to change the ramp rate or set it to instant off. This was a deal breaker for me. On an advanced. Device with other programmable parameters I think instant off / on should be a programmable parameter. Furthermore, one of the internal nut plates on the neutral terminal was cross threaded on arrival.\n23#Failed. Unit failed after two weeks in operation. LED and App shows the device turning on but no power to the lights.\n24#Easy integration with SmartThings. We've been using SmartThings to automate our lights at home. We had initially used smart bulbs but as they burn out, we've been selectively converting some lights to work with smart switches instead. Installation is straight forward and easy. Just make sure you connect the correct neutral wire behind the wall if you have another switch next to this one.\n25#Connect to WINK as a z-wave device. Connecting to a WINK hub is a little tricky. Install the switch as a GE Dimmable Smart Switch and it will be found and work perfectly. The written instructions are a bit tricky. I found that I needed to watch the installation video provided by the manufacturer to get the wiring right.\n26#Great price. Works great. Price is good.\n27#Good value for a Z-Wave switch but what a hassle getting SmartThings to see it. Out of the box, wired it up to replace a defective GE switch and my SmartThings app/hub would not see it. I finally resorted to a Youtube video and found out that you must factory reset this brand before it will be seen. I don't understand this, since it's brand new out of the box why would it need to be reset? So I performed the reset by tapping the top padding 10 times very quickly and then the bottom paddle 10 times. Then SmartThings saw device instantly and it works great. The dimmer function also works well on my LED bulbs. Overall it's a great value compared to other brands.\n28#Easy to install. I am changing all my switches to this type. Eazy installation and add to Hubitat.\n29#Great price, at a small cost. For the money, it's a great dimmer, however, if you're looking to dim many LED bulbs to low levels, you're going to get flickering. I ended up having to redo a few rooms with lower output fixtures to shorten the dimming range. Yes, a more expensive driver would probably work, but if you're working with those more expensive fixtures, you're also not looking at $30 dimmers.\n30#Slow response time. It does the job, but the response time is a little on the slow side compared to GE or ZOOZ.\n31#Way too slow. I bought a couple to test out and I was disappointed with how slow they are to react to user input. About a second and a half for the fade animation to start to turn on or off. But this speeds up significantly if they are configured to act as a switch instead of a dimmer. And when they are on, there is a slight hum to the bulbs. I was also disappointed with the number of configuration options these dimmers had. I went with a different brand that uses Z-wave 700 series chips and they were better in every way.\n32#Good basic Z-Wave dimmer. I have about 12 of these throughout the house, most paired with a three-way companion switch and they work just fine. I really like the clean look of the cover plate that comes with them. Easy to include in the home control system.\n33#Worked as advertised. Very easy to pair with my hub.\n34#Failed after 2 months. The switch worked fine for 2 months then it just wont turn on. It wont even work manually.\n35#Don't buy, will not pair to smart things hub. I purchased this a few months ago because i always like to have extra switches as i am building my shop. I decided to add an extra outside light and installed this right next to another GE Z wave switch. This one will NOT connect to the smart things hub. I have excluded it and added z wave repeaters next to this and the hub itself. After 3 nights of messing around with it, i am just going to buy another GE switch as those will actually work.\n36#Good, reliable switch. These are built as well or better than most. Probably best price from all choices.\n37#Awesome! Best smart dimmer that I have ever bought. I have Leviton and GE smart switches that I use with my Samrthings app. These ones are by far better. Much easier, faster to set up and connect and they don't loose the connection( so far) like the others. I was so impressed that I ended up getting few more.\n38#Won't connect to Smarthings hub. No issues with physical installation or manual operation-straightforward. Very scanty directions and no support for connection to Smarthings hub. Failed to connect or (apparently to reset when I tried that).\n39#Can't adjust dimming speed and flickers with LED bulbs. Pros: Paired easily with my ZWave hub and has very good RF performance. Overall tactile feel is crisp and satisfying and gives a quality impression. Supports pre-staging on-level by programming default brightness level (parameter 32). Cons: The default dimming speed is very slow and there's no way to change it, which is ridiculous. I intended to use this with the 3-way add-on switch to control a fixture having three LED bulbs. Initially the fixture had EcoSmart bulbs which flickered badly when dimmed, so I swapped them out for Sylvania TruWave LED bulbs which are highly-rated for dimming performance. With the Sylvania bulbs, dimming up/down is smooth and flicker-free, almost as perfect as incandescents. HOWEVER there is a BIG problem: whenever the lights are dimmed, every few minutes they flash full bright! This spoils any mood set by dimming the lights. Unfortunately this glitch disqualifies the UltraPro ZWave dimmer for me and ultimately I went back to Insteon dimmers which are more expensive but work great.\n40#Works Well with my ADT Z-Wave Hub. I've installed 8 of these switches and am very pleased with their performance.\n41#Don't get fooled by the picture. it comes in a plain packaging. May be not new. I have bought the Honeywell brand Z-Wav switches before at Costco and on line but they were out of stuck. This looked like them but when I got my item it was in a plain brown box not even the original box that the picture shows and the badge cover was missing. This could be a used one.\n42#Works great for LED Bulbs. Easy to install and works as advertised. Dimming range goes from full bright to a barely visible glow of light, using 45W equivalent standard LED light bulbs.\n43#Good value but would be great if you can customize button. Pretty good switch and relatively easy to install. Prefer another brand that let you set button combination as other actions. But this is pretty good value\n44#Percentages not accurate. Quit working after 4 months. Didn't work right out the box, the percentages did not match the light output. 50% would be darker than 30%. Mac light output was at 60%. Anything higher did not change.. Anything lower than 30, lights would be off. Compared same switch to a Honeywell and I could dim the same light real low 1%-10%. Quit working after 4 months of use.\n45#LED flicker. I ordered these because they seem exactly like the Jatco or GE Dimmers, but my other 10 GE Dimmers don't flicker on low brightness or when adjusting the brightness level. I'm sure with incandescent bulbs you won't notice it, but if you have LEDs and flickering bothers you then I would spend the extra $ and get the real deal\n46#Great Zwave switches with dimming. I bought these for my under cabinet lighting and they work great - no buzzing, perfect dimming. My smart home started with a Wink hub but I switched to SmartThings after Wink’s many outages and the demand for monthly payment. I started with one switch and one bulb but now I've got dozens of devices of all sorts. I think all of these smart switches are made by the same company (Jasco) because I have GE, Enbrighten, and now these UltraPro and they all look and work the same. Don’t hesitate to pick these up for your network. Adds easily to SmartThings as a Zwave device using the QR code on the switch.\n47#Best Z-Wave dimmer on the market. I have installed a wide variety of ZWave switches and this is by far the best for several reasons. First and foremost is the slim profile, which is useful (critical) in multi-gang boxes. Not only does it make installation easier, it provides a better cooling profile, which is nice compared to the metal cooling fins of the GE/Jasco switches. The switch itself is responsive, which is something I had a problem with the Zooz switches. Finally, it paired easily with SmartThings.\n48#Good solid switch for standard (not 3 way) lighting. The switch works weil and feels well made: the mechanism is precise and equal in both directions. However this switch needs an add-on switch for 3-way installations, and rather than buying the add-on, I bought a switch that did not need an add-on to work with existing 3-way switches. I used these switches in applications where there was only one switch to control the lighting.\n49#Fire and forget with limited features compared to lesser known brands. I expected better compatibility and support. I also expected an easy install. That part was more my mistake in assuming that this would work in 3-way configurations, but nope you need to spend extra on a grossly overpriced switch that is nothing more than a standard dumb switch with a few resistors and a diode. Due to non-specific device profiles in SmartThings not all features are able to be used. I returned these and went with another brand that doesn't need you to replace the other dumb switch for 3-way functions and seemed very responsive to questions.",
