After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Multi-Function Combination Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a.

Center switch broke after 10 months\n1#Safety hazard - switch shorted open. I installed this to restore a bathroom electric light/fan/heater. Once installed I found all switches functioned, but were very flimsy. After just a few cycles one of the switches failed short (on) and since it was connected to the heater it caused that unit to run continuously. Fortunately I was present for the failure and able to de-energize the circuit in time to prevent overheating. This could have caused a fire otherwise. I question the UL listing on this device. It replaced a switch that lasted 40 years, and only worked for a week with less than a dozen cycles. Cheap, shoddy, and dangerous.\n2#One of the three integral switches defective. It sparked when I turned one of the switches on after I installed it.. Lower quality than Leviton that I replaced this with from Lowe’s\n3#Looks good. Easy to install, fit just right.\n4#This was just what we needed. This worked perfectly! Was exactly what was described!\n5#Awesome. Great product.\n6#Right choice. Controlling the lights\n7#Exactly what we needed. We have a Broan bathroom fan/light/nightlight, so we hooked it up to this triple rocker switch and can control all three. No issues.\n8#Good switch. The switch was easy to install, but the face plate was smaller than I would like so I had to go out and purchase a bigger face plate to cover it\n9#Good material! Work excellent and durable material!\n10#Installed it and the switch was bad. The switch was bad when I installed the switch!\n11#Elegant. Looks very nice and modern\n12#Quality switch. works great. Higher quality than what I thought it would be. And the \"press-in\" connections on this are really nice. Just slip in the slot, screw the clamp down. Way easier than wrapping the wires around the screws and better than the press in ones that are just a barb that holds it in that no one should trust. Switches feel nice too.\n13#precio .uy bueno. fasil de intalar\n14#Looks bigger than it is. In the picture it looks like it would be normal size, but is extremely small. Turns out this wasn't the one I needed because it was way too small.\n15#Light switch. Satisfied!!\n16#Good Quality. Works well for bathroom vent/ light/ fan.\n17#Great product! Worked as described! Need I say more?\n18#Smooth Working. I use this for my bathroom exhaust fan/heater/light combo. Works great and looks good, too.\n19#Love them! Super easy to install!\n20#Works great. great product, easy to install, love it!\n21#Good for the price. I bought This 3 pole light switch to replace broken bathroom switch It has easy to install terminals and works fine Wont get warm Just the color doesn’t exactly match the existing cover wish it came with a cover\n22#works. Not much to say.\n23#Working well, looking good! Simple and clean design, easy to wire, what more do you need?\n24#Worked for Broan bathroom fan installation. I bought a Broan bathroom fan, not realizing that with a humidity-sensing feature and a light in the unit, additional wiring would have to be run. Running the extra wiring makes the installation a chore, but no fault of the switch. This switch did the trick, and was much lower cost than the Broan switch, or switches from the big box stores. You do not need a special overpriced switch from Broan, as they would lead you to believe.\n25#The worst switch ever cheap and fragile. The plastic switches broke after a month of use. The are made of very delicate plastic. Do not buy.\n26#Send back- very small. I was meaning to send it back but never got around to it. This thing is the size of my middle finger. No exaggeration. If I could find it, I would have uploaded a picture\n27#Wrong Size. This is a SINGLE SWITCH size. Wrong for me. Good luck. Otherwise norm product.\n28#Updated design. Love the clean look of these switches. Replacing all to this brand and model\n29#Good quality and fast shipping. Good quality and fast shipping\n30#Exelent. Very good exelent product\n31#as advertised. Awesome, very reasonable price and very easy to install\n32#Didn't work. This didn't work in our 60 year old house. Tried several electrical supply stores to see if it could be adapted and even hired electrician...no help.\n33#Great switch. Switches have nice tension and it works great. Very easy to install\n34#Attractive triple switch. This which is very attractive and works nicely but the wires in the light that we were connecting to it seem very short so my electrician had extra work to do to work with the short wires but that was not any fault of the switch the switch is beautiful and works well. Thank you.\n35#Easy to install and competitive price as the big stores. Wires are easy to terminate and nice looking switch.\n36#as described. As described\n37#Good product. Value for money.\n38#Works great. Works great\n39#Need replacement. My LED light occasionally flicker. Engaging bathroom fan makes LED above tub shut off and then come right back on(assumed voltage drop). Easy replacement sent. Hope it works\n40#Effective containment. Mt rcyrician installed this so I.could have my two bathroom lights and the fan on separate switches. Keeps everything looking neat",
