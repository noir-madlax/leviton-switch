The good part is that it is easy to install. The bad part is the functionality once it is installed. The app is not good, and worst of all, it specifically does not connect with 5 g wifi. Sometimes it connects to Amazon Alexa, and then it won't connect, and it is impossible to get it to reconnect. Terribly unreliable. There has to be something better\n1#worked, but now it doesn't. Worked for awhile, but stopped connecting to wifi and turns off randomly after 8 months.\n2#Do not waste your time buying this. The absolute worst switch that I ever owned. It worked for about 30 days, then it started flickering. Now it is uncontrollable. It turns on and off as it wishes, dimmer goes from minimum to maximum, and everywhere in between constantly.\n3#Garbage. Dimmer does not dim. Garbage, don't buy. Manual dimmer does not work.\n4#Fantastic! Good purchase, it looks elegant in my living room.\n5#They look great. Not so easy to install, but they do look great.\n6#Dual dimmer with app/alexa capabilties. dimmer works great and allows control via app and/or alexa. Was fairly easy to install though the instructions aren't great. Was able to connect to router fairly easy but as I said the instruction are lacking detail.\n7#works great. I recently installed the GHome Smart Dual Dimmer Switch and I’m really impressed with how well it works. The 2-in-1 control feature is awesome because I can easily adjust the lighting for two different areas with a single switch, which is a huge space-saver in my home. The WiFi connectivity is seamless, and I was able to set it up with my smart home system in no time using the app. The dimming feature is smooth, and it lets me adjust the light intensity just right, whether I want it bright for reading or dim for a cozy atmosphere. I love being able to control the lighting remotely through the app or with voice commands via Alexa or Google Assistant. It’s convenient, especially when I’m in bed or outside and want to turn the lights off without getting up. The switch itself has a sleek, modern design that blends well with my decor, and the installation was straightforward, even for someone who’s not super handy. I also appreciate how responsive it is—there's no lag when I adjust the lights. Overall, the GHome Smart Dual Dimmer Switch has definitely made my home smarter and more efficient. It’s a great option for anyone looking to add smart controls to their lighting system, and I highly recommend it!\n8#Defective. Within a year the switch goes bad. The smart part still works for now so I m able to control via google home, but the wall clicks are not doing anything. Have emailed the seller but no response yet.\n9#Útil. Cumplió las expectativas.\n10#Amazing product. It works perfectly with Amazon Alexa and also the switch feels very sturdy and high quality. I would personally recommend it\n11#Disappointing and Frustrating. I had high hopes for the GHome Smart Dual Dimmer Switch, but it has been a huge letdown. The installation was more complicated than expected, especially with the neutral wire requirement, and the instructions were unclear. Once set up, the switch never worked consistently with Alexa or Google Home, despite multiple attempts to troubleshoot. The dimming function was unreliable, and sometimes the switch wouldn't respond to voice commands at all. I also noticed frequent connectivity issues.\n12#Purchased 2 years ago and it's still junk...Turns on whenever if feels the need... I have no control of it. you must reset it all the time. It's junk in my book...\n13#Broke the first day. This held sooo much promise, but alas no, it wasn’t to be, died the same night it was installed 🙄\n14#Works well once you get it set up. It is a nice dimmer that allows you to put two dimmers into a single switch box position. It seems to work well. I have only had it in operation for about one hour. It works easily with Alexa. However, It is difficult to set up in the Gosund app (have to do this for Alexa control). because the instructions are inaccurate and I have almost given up. There are no flashing lights when it goes into setup mode. I happened to go to the WiFi network list on my phone after doing the reset and found a GOSUND_<MacAddr> network and connected to it and it set up. They should really be clearer that this unit (the SW7) does not have any indication it is in setup mode. This is a documentation issue.\n15#returned. had voltage bleed through\n16#Working perfect! Easy to install and love dimmer switch!\n17#Didn't work. Didn't work, wouldn't pair after 2 hours of trying\n18#High EMF output. dimmers work well but very high EMF output per my trimeter. Replacing with a dual dimmer without wifi.\n19#Dual dimmer smart switch. Easy push in quick wires installation. Works as described\n20#Another Perfect Gosund Product!! Gosund has done it again! Combining 2 switches into one unit is genius!! They integrate seamlessly with Alexa or the app. It’s great to be able to turn my lights on for my dogs if I get stuck out late! Love Gosund!!\n21#Works pretty well. Easy to use. Modern looking and very functional. I can use it with my previous home control app. I also use it with Alexa. Great for controlling two lights from the same place.\n22#Such a good Dual Light Switch. This light switch is great! What a fantastic way to reduce Wall plate clutter with too many switches! I love the fact that this switch was easy to install, saves space, and looks great! The set up was simple and quick in the GoSund app! I cannot wait to see what else they put out for 3-way switches!\n23#Great functionality. It works great and good functionality overall\n24#Great Dual Dimmer Switch and Space Saver. The smart dimmer switch has a very nice design, allowing you to control two switches in one unit. The price is reasonable, comparable to a single dimmer switch. It functions very well, and I particularly like its design. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with Alexa, making it easy to control with voice commands. This switch is great for my usage because I was able to run additional wires and control my ceiling set of lights with two controllers. I can have half of them on or dimmed, or have them all off or dimmed. I’m very satisfied with this purchase.\n25#Controls both lights magnificently. There was apprehensive when I bought this, worried that I would need an electrician to install. No, I did it myself...the instructions were very clear, and the install went well. My google mini controls my kitchen lights perfectly.\n26#Dual Dimmer Smart switch. Very easy to set up this smart switch. Work with apps, Alexa and voice control. Good update for lazy people like me. I am able to control lights from where I sit and don’t have to stand up to lower the lights.\n27#Good till it fails. Had this for 1.5 years, Connection was not difficult, just couple basic knowledge. Configuration was easy, as other smart devices. Esthetic looks good and I really like it fits in a single slot in the wall. The 3 stars come from post sale service. year and a half and the switch stopped connecting to my wifi, Nothing has changed, I do have other smart devices in the same network. Tried resetting the switch, disconnecting and connecting again and couldn't make it work. Wrote in their contact form and haven't gotten any response after a couple days. Hopefully they can help me figure out what may be wrong and diagnose if it can be solved or have to get a new switch.\n28#Absolute Game Changer!! The value and ease of installation alone make this switch a real game changer! This switch is very easy to install and set-up using the Gosund app and the integration with Alexa was fast and simple. It looks great and works flawlessly both manually and with my Alexa. I have several other switches in my home that I am going to upgrade to GHome Smart Switches!!\n29#Easy to install and helpful to dim my bright lights. This dimmer switch is easy to use and install. I easily connected it to my Alexa as Alexa recognized the tool automatically. It allows me to turn on and off without needing to get up to change. Also with my lights being bright it helps me change brightness depending on time of day.\n30#Great and Easy to use. Easy set up and great product support!\n31#limited dimming range. overall this is an ok switch. pro: 2 pole in a single gang, wifi. cons: connection can be trick, need a tiny screw driver to tighten lugs, and mostly very limited dimming range. on it lowest dimming setting, the brightness is still 50% brighter when compared to any other switch. unfortunately, one switch i can find with all these features.\n32#Once I figured it out…works great. Wouldn’t go into pairing mode at first. Finally got it paired and it works great!\n33#Not reliable. I had to replace this identical switch after less than 2 years because the previous switch simply would not turn on unless I pressed the switch and held it down for several seconds, 2 times in a row! It was out of warranty by then. The effort involved in replacing the switch was also substantial for a novice like me, especially since I was working under the kitchen cabinets. If the manufacturer wants more business, they should have a 5/10 year warranty. Secondly this switch does not dim the lights as much as the last one. I just pray this one lasts longer...\n34#Easy to install, seamless integration. Identify the place and install. It was half hours job for me as this was the first time installing. Easy connecting with Alexa and controlling the device. Value for money\n35#Great Dimmer with great controls! Once installed, the device was very easy to set up and use. GHome knocks another one out the park! The level of control you have from the app is great, and it easily integrates with home automation systems. That's why I got all my electric switches, dimmers, and light switches from this company. I use home assistant and everything integrates seamlessly once you set it up.\n36#Worked as intended. I installed this dual dimmer switch for the kitchen at my daughter’s house. She bought five led recessed lights, three for the kitchen and two over the kitchen sink divided in two separate circuits. So far, we haven’t encountered any issues as mentioned by other reviewers here. For example, one reviewer mentioned that the switch did not include electrical wires. Well, the switch does not have built-in wiring. You insert the circuit wiring from the wall into its corresponding connection in the switch, i.e. G, H, L1, L2, N, and tighten the respective screw. Another reviewer mentioned that they couldn’t figure out how to turn the individual circuits On/Off. Although I didn’t read the included instructions and don’t know how clear they are when it comes to using this feature, it’s very simple to use. One circuit is controlled (turn On/Off) by pressing the upper part of the switch, while the other circuit is controlled by pressing the lower part of the switch. For example, in our case, pressing the upper part of the switch will turn the kitchen main lights On/Off, while pressing the lower part of the switch will do the same for the over the sink lights. As for the reviewer who mentioned about constantly having to reconnect the switch to the app, this could be caused by loose wiring, either within the switch or somewhere within the electrical circuit. One thing my daughter was not too happy about is that as opposed to the manual non-WiFi dimmer this one replaced, the intensity of the lights do not go down far enough for her taste. Other than that, she’s very satisfied with the way the switch operates.\n37#Nice design with dual functionality. The smart dimmer switch has a very nice design and allows you to control two switches in one unit. It The price is quite reasonable, comparable to a single dimmer switch. It functions very well, and I particularly like its design. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with Alexa, making it easy to control with voice commands. This switch is great for my usage because I was able to run additional wires and control my ceiling set of lights with two controllers. I can have half of them on or dimmed, or have them all off or dimmed. Overall, I’m very satisfied with this purchase.\n38#works great, but dimming LED is questionable. Overall, the switch was easy to install and works as advertised. Only complaint is that it doesn't dim LED lights very much. seems to be pretty common with smart switches and LED lights.\n39#GHome Double Dimmer WiFi Switch has exceeded my expectations. I recently upgraded my home lighting system with the GHome Double Dimmer WiFi Switch, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance and features. This device has significantly enhanced the convenience and ambiance of my home, making it a standout addition to my smart home setup. Installation and Setup Installing the GHome Double Dimmer WiFi Switch was a breeze. The package included clear, step-by-step instructions that made the process simple, even for someone with basic DIY skills. The switch connected to my existing WiFi network without any issues, and the entire setup was completed in about 30 minutes. Design and Functionality The switch boasts a sleek and modern design that blends seamlessly with my home decor. The dual dimmer functionality is fantastic, allowing independent control of two different light sources from a single switch. App Integration and Voice Control The GHome app is intuitive and user-friendly, offering a range of features that enhance the overall user experience. I can easily dim the lights, set schedules, and create lighting scenes directly from my smartphone. Additionally, the switch integrates perfectly with both Alexa and Google Assistant. Voice commands work flawlessly, allowing hands-free control over my lighting setup.\n40#**Perfect Smart Solution for Modern Homes!**. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Perfect Smart Solution for Modern Homes!** The SPACE-SAVING Dual Dimmer Switch is an absolute game-changer for anyone looking to streamline their home lighting system. This smart switch allows you to control two lights separately with ease, making your home design simple and elegant.

These are our first Dimmer Switch and we have no regrets about them so far. I love these Dimmer Switchs they are very easy to set up and work great. The app is also really simple to navigate and makes the experience so enjoyable.\n42#A double dimmer! Saving on wall space with the double dimmer switch!\n43#works great and easy to install. Bluetooth works good and I installed it pretty quick. no issues that I can see\n44#Perfect dimmer switch. This GHome Smart Dual Dimmer Switch is a brilliant addition to my smart home! Its 2-in-1 design and voice control capabilities make it super convenient, and it works flawlessly with Alexa and Google Home. Highly recommend!\n45#Amazing Switch. This Smart switch was very easy to install and connect to the app. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow and it came with screws and a cover plate. The dimming is accurate and works great with my lights. It was very simple to connect to Alexa to control the switch. The app/alexa control was instant. I highly recommend the switch\n46#Nice smart dimmer. The smart dimmer is very easy to install and works great. It can control two lights, however, I only use one. It works pretty well with the Tuya app. Very happy and recommend it to everyone.\n47#Happy customer. Good quality switch, doesn't feel cheap. Works really well, and hooks up easily to Google Home. GHome has great products - my house is full of their stuff because it works and is reliable. Easy installation as well.\n48#what was once old is now new...and functional...oh and pretty :). One of these things you never think you need until, until you have it. then you are so glad you have it. I have a lot of these smart switches throughout the entire home , i have zero complaints. they do require a neutral wire. The GE switches i have constantly disconnect and have cycling issues, these ghome ones have never given me an issue.",
