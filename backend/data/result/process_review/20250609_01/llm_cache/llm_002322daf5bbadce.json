    "prompt": "Extract comprehensive customer insights from reviews about Products.\nThe output format is JSON in English:\n{\n\"phy\": {\n\"<PHYSICAL>\": {\n\"<PID>@<DETAIL>\": {\n\"<SENT>\": [ID, …]\n}\n}\n},\n\"perf\": {\n\"<PERF>\": {\n\"<perf_id>@<DETAIL>\": {\n\"<SENT>\": {<PERF_REASON>: [ID, …]}\n}\n}\n},\n\"use\": {\n\"<USE>\": {\n\"<SENT>\": {<USE_REASON>: [ID, …]}\n}\n}\n}\n\nDefinitions:\n- <PID>: Unique ID for physical aspect (\"phy\"), starting from A. After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Products without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Products' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment. Include all mentioned reasons, or \"?\" if none can be inferred. <USE_REASON> and <USE> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- <PHYSICAL>/<PERF> and <DETAIL> MUST NOT include:\n  * Generic statements without details (e.g., \"good\", \"bad quality\")\n  * Issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., \"fast shipping\", \"delivery time\")\n- If a review mentions any physical aspect, related performance, or use together, extract them as separate entries under \"phy,\" \"perf,\" and \"use,\" with no overlap.\n- Make sure each <DETAIL> is under the most relevant <PHYSICAL> or <PERF> in the context of Products\n- Preserve negations\n\nKey Instructions:\n- Break down reviews with multiple aspects, performances, or uses into individual entries.\n- Escape special characters with backslash that could cause JSON syntax errors.\n- Include only explicitly mentioned reasons, and use \"?\" where no reason is mentioned.\n\nFinal Checklist:\n- Go through all reviews and ensure that no aspect, performance, use, or reason is omitted, even if only mentioned once.\n- Review all entries to ensure proper separation between aspects, performances, and uses.\n\nPrint the JSON result only.\nInput format:\n<ID>#<review>\n\n[[INPUT]]\n0#Different colors. I’m very disappointed they came with 2 different colors! It doesn’t match at all.\n1#It just works. Easy installation, easy app download, easy WiFi connection, works flawlessly!\n2#Be smart! We are setting up our smart home and these switches are perfect. Controllable remotely through the app or through Alexa. Programmable to come on automatically for reliable porch lights, night lights, whatever.\n3#Leviton WiFi Dimmer - quality product. I just installed the Leviton WiFi dimmer. The installation is easy but you need to identify the black wire that carries the power. You can see how to do this on the listing's video. The WiFi set up was a little messy but once it was done, by first linking to the \"My Leviton\" google app, then the \" Amazon Alexa Home\" app, the Alexa voice command works great. This is only the second day with the switch so I don't have any long-term report. I have other Leviton light switches and they are top quality compared to others. I expect the same for this one.\n4#Good switch, but dimmed lights flicker, Good quality switch, hooks up to Amazon Echo well. LEDs flicker when dimmed. Not 100% sure if it's the switch or the bulbs, but I tried 3 brands. Easy to install for a handy person.\n5#Easy install. Works like a charm. I’m no electrician, and I managed to install it and get it working. Just follow the instructions and enjoy.\n6#Best Smart Switch by far. I'm in the process of switching all of my other smart fit switches to this brand. Works well with Alexa as compared to my other brands; By that I mean it's never broke the connection.\n7#High quality and smoothly dims. Love love love. I was using Tp Link switches before and they have trouble smoothly dimming. These are rock solid, connect right up to home assistant with homekit and i find them more aestheticly pleasing. I enjoy the tactile click.\n8#Easy installation. Worked great! Had areas i didn't want to hardwired and these made adding light switches right were i needed them.\n9#very good. works as advertised\n10#Leviton is #1. Love these switches. Replaced all switches in home remodeling and used these in select locations. Easy to install if you have any electrical background. You must hook up the neutral wire for these to work correctly. Pre wired with color coded wiring. Easy to connect with the internet and no hub required. The app seems to work flawlessly for me. Very Happy with the Leviton Products. Also if you want screwless wall plates only use the leviton brand, I tried using cheaper ones and they wouldn't sit flush with the wall.\n11#Gen 2 is great. Gen 2 is easier to install\n12#Easy to wire - Matter readiness requires firmware update. It was simple to wire. Do make sure you have neutral in the box before buying! Recommend down loading the Leviton App ASAP so you can get into the Matter upgrade program. The firmware in the switches currently shipping don't support Matter. Once you have the switch up on your home network (following Leviton directions) go to device settings and Check for Firmware Update Current version supporting Matter is 2.1.25. Once upgraded a new menu item \"Matter Pairing Code\" will appear. Click this and write down the 11-digit code. The go to the switch and hold the top paddle for 7 seconds to put the switch in Pairing Mode (flashing green led). Go to your hub controller and add the new Matter device using the require procedure for your hub and the 11-digit Matter Pairing code. Let me add that I contacted the Leviton support, and they did their best to support me. Now that I know the process I may buy this switch again - but first it has to pass my break in and reliability tests.\n13#Automated light control works without needing special hub. I'm trying to automate the house as much as I can. We have a need to be able to control some things like lighting via automation to alert a deaf person for things like when it's time to get up. This product with the app support allows you to create schedules and control the lighting. Control via third party apps like Siri and Alexa is also supported. I wish it was possible to directly automate from things like fire alarms but you can utilize these third party tools to 'cobble' something together. I requested direct support for a fire alarms feature from the manufacture but they have not committed to it. When I did have trouble with one of the devices the email support was top notch. We were able to resolve the issue quickly in just a few email exchanges.\n14#Best smart switch so far. We’ve tried multiple smart switches for our home. Leviton were the most straightforward to install, practically did the connection to the MyLeviton app completely on its own, and they work flawlessly. Seriously worth the extra cost. The less expensive brands took forever to synch and were fussy. I love these. Great functions, easy to program, well built. They also come with an ivory switch that you can change out so you can install it as ivory or white. So awesome!\n15#Easy to install -app is easy to use. I bought this to replace a 20 year old timer that controls my porch lights. I was able to open up the switch and easily line up the wires with the wires on the new switch. After swapping them out, and turning the power back on - everything just worked!\n16#Works Well With Apple Homekit. I have three of these Leviton Dimmer switches. Clear instructions and easy to wire up. Very compatible with Apple’s HomeKit. If you want to ad a smart dimmer switch to your Apple HomeKit this one just works.\n17#Wi-Fi Indulgence. Who needs a Wi-Fi wall switch?! We do!! It is so convenient and links to Alexa and the phone app. The contractor added them to a kitchen renovation and we asked for a couple more in two other rooms that have ceiling lights. The dimming transition on both old and new led lamps is very smooth. Save the boxes that have the barcode (for setup purposes) in case you need to add them to a new network or you sell your house.\n18#Works smoothly with Apple Homekit. It just works, boringly smooth.",
