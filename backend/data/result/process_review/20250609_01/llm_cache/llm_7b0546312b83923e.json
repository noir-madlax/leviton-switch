And shorted out. One of the packs I bought was used. The box was taped shut but the other wasn’t. All 3 switches in the same box were bad and didn’t work. Looked like they’d been shorted out. Very dangerous to sell something electrical as “new” that’s used and faulty.\n1#A quality product from a proven company. Leviton Decora 600-Watt Single-Pole/3-Way Universal Rocker Slide Dimmer, White (3-Pack). We were freshening up our 34-year-old house. New interier paint, many new (LED) light fixtures and all new outlets and switches. We used six dimmer switches in a three-bedroom, two-bath house. They all work great and look like the regular switches. TURN OF BREAKERS BEFORE REPLACING ELECTRICAL PARTS.\n2#Incomplete and also defective product. This did not come with the color change kit as advertised. Also, one of the 3 switches was defective. Seller did not provide for replacement of the product or refund since the time period (14 days in this case) was exceeded. I repurchased from a more reputable seller. Why doesn't Amazon do something to a) compensate the purchasers of this falsely advertised product and b) prevent this seller from continuing to sell this?\n3#Only in white not other colors described. Advertised as having light almond optional color with product. The product is only white.\n4#Good price but don’t work properly. I’ve installed hundreds of switches and outlets, and never had bad experiences as I did with these switches. Good price, but absolute garbage. They frequently flicker and /or simply don’t turn on until you hit the switch several times. I installed five of these and have to replace all of them. Basicly junk that cost more since you have to replace them. I should add, I'll admit that I did not realize this was a refurbished product ... but ..... why would anyone even produce a refurbished switch? ... thus who would think to check on that? Don't buy this!\n5#Good value and free shipping. 30% cheaper than the box stores. Single pole or 3-way. Programmable, higher wattage rated for all bulb types.\n6#THERE ARE NO LIGHT ALMOND COVERS IN PACKAGE - DESCRIPTION IS INACCURATE. BEWARE OF DESCRIPTION -- THERE ARE NO LIGHT ALMOND COVERS INCLUDED These are very high quality switches so WHY is this a ONE STAR... so potential purchasers will pay attention and NOTE that the DESCRIPTION IS INACCURATE.... so if you need WHITE... you're good... if you need LIGHT ALMOND you are wasting your time. the supplier is not cooperative with returns due to the inaccurate description and won't make a change to the description which is highly disconcerting and worrisome.\n7#Faceplates are NOT included. The comments are incorrect. The faceplates are not included. The boxes also looked very beat up, bottoms open. Factor in the cost of faceplates before you decide if this is a competitive deal.\n8#Love these dimmer switches... Replaced my ugly dimmers with this sleek looking design...They are working great!!!\n9#Excellent Product. A little more expensive than other rocker style switches but hands down the best quality one you will find.",
