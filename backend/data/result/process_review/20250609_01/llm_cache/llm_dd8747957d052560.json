While this works well and is easy to install, I've had to replace this every two to three years because it just will no longer control the device, even though I can control it through the app or Alexa. The switch itself stops working, and a new one then works. So I'm not sure I'd recommend this. If I buy one now it'll be my third in 7 years at this house.\n1#Perfect switch. Easy install and works great with Alexa and others\n2#I love the product for most part. I have been surprised by the number of software updates, often with new features. I wish my house wiring was better and these switches were less expensive $25-$30 would be fair. Sometimes I have problems with google assistant and Apple Homekit. Apple homekit is a pain to setup but I blame Apple for this as that issue spans multiple manufacturer devices. I have one switch in kitchen that gets reset by barstool chairback and have to connect with homekit often. Sometimes google loses track of devices. The Leviton app always works well. I like that the dimmer switch can also be on/off. Customer support has been good. Works well with counter part devices for multiple locations (used both wired and wireless). I like that it can work with Homekit, Google and Alexa (smart being agnostic). The 26HD is well built. Installation can be tricky, as switch takes up more room in box leaving less room for wires.\n3#Very important remote switch. Needed sister remote switch to the master device\n4#NOT A ROCKER SWITCH!!! This is not a rocker switch!!! There is no on/off position, instead it has two momentary buttons disguised as a rocker switch with absolutely no mention of this fact on the store page! Not what I expected from leviton...\n5#Love it. Needed it for smart switch in three way switch config. Works well\n6#Disappointing features. I would like more robust night-time settings. The app currently allows one to turn on the lights at night time, but not turn them off after a configurable time period. I don't want lights on all night, but I would like them on for several hours at sunset.\n7#Works great! Our entire house is now run by these switches for lights and other equipment. The company provides major support over the phone for installing so pretty easy to install.\n8#Scam or something. Just opened my smart switch to find a used light switch. Didn't really notice the box didn't look perfect but it didn't look opened.\n9#Easy to install once you follow the instructions. This remote switch worked great with DDL-06 Decora Dimmer switch. Pairing with the main dimmer was straight forward, all I had to do was press the side dimmer on the remote either up or down and it paired with the master switch. Installing was easy once I followed the instructions and watched a few youtube videos.\n10#Nice remote switch. Does exactly what it’s made for. Doesn’t need any setup since it just communicates with the other switch. I recommend reading the instructions for both switches before installing them, because I had one mostly installed before realizing the switches can’t be installed interchangeably. The one that is NOT the companion has to be the one hooked up to the load (light). One other item important to note is that this doesn’t work exactly like a 3-way switch. One of the wires has continuous power, and the traveler wire is used to communicate between the switches. I somehow kept missing the section in the instructions that show the line wire and wire going to the switch both being connected to the same screw.\n11#Works with Alexa and Google Assistant. These are great for voice control of your lights. I would just say that Leviton needs to do some security work on their database that controls these Internet-connected lights. One April Fools day the lights in my house randomly started turning off or on when we didn't command them to do so. Support at Leviton claimed they had a system upgrade and it went a little buggy, but was then resolved. My feeling is some programmer left an easter egg in their code and they didn't want people to know. Outside of that, the control of the lights ran awry the same way one other time in the 3 years since I've had them, but it wasn't April 1st that time. Not sure what it is, but if it keeps happening, it would be something weird\n12#not working at all its old product even the switch color changed. not working at all its old product even the switch color changed\n13#No wall plate. Pictures are deceptive, the product doesn't include a wall plate.\n14#Home automation impossible with these. Either the hub has EXTREMELY poor range, or it is just a piece of junk... probably both. You can use these as expensive regular switches, maybe you can get a connection for a few minutes and program some features like night mode brightness etc, maybe you can't get connected. But for sure, the connectivity between the switches and the hub is so poor you will never be able to use the app or any other automation without getting frustrated.\n15#Works perfect with smart switch. 30 seconds setup once you have it installed. Quick response just like the normal switch\n16#Unreliable, requires frequent pairing. Look elsewhere for a dependable devise. Works well when it works but flakes out frequently and is a nuisance to constant pairing sequence. Not worth the time and money.\n17#Works as intended. This worked great as a companion for Leviton D26HD smart dimmer.\n18#Works to complete 3-way config w/ companion D26HD smart switch. TLDR; Yes, it works, and yes, I’ll be buying more for my other 3-way d26hd & dw6hd installations Use of this or a similar Leviton companion device/switch is required to make a functional 3-way switch operation using the other Leviton 3-way supporting smart switches. Installation was straightforward per the instructions. For me, the total time to install and set-up in a +100yr old house with older wiring was less than 20min from start to finish. Getting this via Amazon was a good value and had a significantly quicker delivery, and the cost is similar to, if not lower than, my local suppliers. The bottom line is that I recommend them.\n19#Many physically broke apart; others kept falling off our z-wave network. I spent thousands of dollars to convert all my light switches to Leviton. First, many of them broke physically (parts falling off or internal parts breaking). Second, switches would periodically disappear from my Z-Wave network and would need to be re-added. It is now three years later and I have decided to completely replaced every Leviton switch with TP-Link Kasa. I am much happier.\n20#Converts 3-way and 4-way setups to be smart; works and looks great. The DD00R-DLZ Companion Dimmer is required when converting from a conventional 3 or 4-way setup. It/they get connected to the line (hot) side, upstream from a Leviton D26HD which gets wired to the load (i.e. light bulb) and does the controlling. I must admit I struggled to get it wired right on the first one I did. I just did another 3-way and a 4-way set of switches and it went smooth. The resulting smart switches look nice and function as you would expect a modern, quality dimmer switch should. I highly recommend them. Only the D26HD needs to be added to the Leviton app for firmware and setup, for these switches are just messaging that switch. Any activity performed on these are mirrored by the D26HD as well as the other companion switch in the case of a 4-way setup. Although i would not order a D26HD from Amazon Warehouse, for when I tried what arrived was often only the package containing some other switch. I would recommend getting the companion switches that way for you can often save $10 or more per switch. I've ordered 1/2 dozen thru the warehouse, and so far all worked and looked perfect. I suspect because of the clear window present in that switch's packaging, people are less likely to try swap out what they return. Perhaps Leviton needs to add a window to all its packaging or Amazon needs to open and inspect returns better. Update 9/24/2022: I spoke to soon (perhaps I jinxed myself) for of the two I ordered from AW, only one contained that switch. Now I must wait for another to ship before I can make my 4-way hall switch smart. It was interesting to find a more expensive Leviton D215S (2nd gen smart switch, non-dimming) was within the Leviton DD00R-DLZ packaging. Fortunately I found a use for it, so didn't have to go thru the hassle of returning it.\n21#Unreliable. I purchased this smart switch and two compatible remote switches to control the living room lights in a new home. They were easy to install, but don't work reliably. You can always control the lights from the master switch, but the remotes only work occasionally. I have spent too much time with customer support trying to get them to work. I'm an electrical engineer. Leviton customer support verified that I installed them correctly. Their only suggestion is that I should upgrade the software in the switches. This requires a Wi-fi connection, which isn't up and running yet in the new house. They were not amenable to replacing the switches, or allowing me to return them. I don't have the time to play with updating the software IN A SWITCH! I don't recommend anyone buying these switches unless they want to spend hours getting them to work with questionable results. I do have to say that I have installed dozens of Leviton smart switches and remote switches without dimming control. They have always worked flawlessly. That's why I took a chance with these smart switches with dimming capability. I am going to throw them in a box and install conventional 3-way/4-way switches and give up the ability to dim the lights. The box will probably find the landfill eventually.\n22#Works great! (after I wired it correctly). I paired this with the Leviton D26HD-2RW Decora Smart Wi-Fi dimmer. Although this a companion device and can’t be used without a Decora smart switch, this becomes the master switch (per the installation diagram) and must be installed in the box with the hot “line”, and the smart switch be comes the remote and must be connected to the “load”. This is totally backwards from my previous setup and caused me some anxiety when the lights wouldn’t stop blinking on and off. Once I swapped the 2 switches they work brilliantly.\n23#do not buy first generation. very troubling to get it to continue connection to HomeKit. The company finally replaced it with the current generation that does work.\n24#Don’t work with some mesh network features. I spent hours and contacted tech support without success. I finally found a comment from a user that said they had to disable “fast roaming” on a mesh network. Frustrating that you can’t have all mesh network features enabled on your existing network and more disappointing that their documentation and tech support doesn’t know this and share it.\n25#Not a Remote Chance! Bought these to replace existing on-off switches in my daughter's new abode. Fit well, works fine. Lights in dimmers are not too bright...just enough to see the status. Never HAVE understood why these are \"three-way\" and not \"two-way\"! Oh well...in today's world, who KNOWS?\n26#Clean look. Needed for other switch. Had a lightning strike close to the house. Had a few things get fried. Replaced like for like and everything works as it should\n27#Did not work with D26HD Wi-Fi switch. As the title states, in a three way set up this switch did not work with the D26HD as advertised and recommended.\n28#Requires 2 extra household wires (traveler communication wires) if installing in a 3-way. Requires 2 extra household wires (traveler communication wires) if installing in a 3-way.\n29#Pretty user friendly. I have several of these that I have installed in my home. They have worked fantastic for me, occasionally they get a little warm. I use them with my google home and they have flawless integration.\n30#Works great with the DZ6HD switch. Installed this remote 3 way with a Leviton Z-Wave plus DZ6HD. Indicators and dimming functionality works like a champ, and exactly as you would expect it to. 3 wire install required. Interesting to note that you can have up to 5 switches with these devices!\n31#works well. Upgraded whole house from contractor grade toggles to mix of smart and dumb decora switches.

[1] Used for on/off floor lamp [2] Used for night stand lamp [3] Had this and Leviton IPF01-1LZ IllumaTech 1.5A Quiet Step Preset Fan Speed Control, but liked this one so much more I use this even in places I wanted a \"dumb\" fan speed controller. [4] Used for replacing toggle switches that don't need to be smart [5] Used for bathroom fan light hi/lo [6] Used for bathroom fan on/off [7] Used in laundry room, walk-in closets & pantry areas where these is no lights and your hands are likely full [8] Some house upgrades elimated the need to switches (they use hand help remotes), so for these instead of leaving a dummy switch in place that did nothing, I replaced when with these and their decora equivalent.\n32#Doesn't quite match the fan controller. This functions a bit different than the fan controller it goes with. There are 8 lights instead of 4, and they illuminate in a different way. Also, the air gap switch comes off when pressed at the top.\n33#Great to remotely manage 2-way lights. Easy install. Just works.\n34#Works well. I reviewed the main switch separately, it works well, and does everything I wanted, so I won't go into details. Aside from functionality, installation was a bit unorthodox. One of the travelers hooks to the same lead as the hot, which is not a problem but might be unexpected. My prior dimmer switches didn't need a neutral, and since this needs one but didn't come with a neutral lead built in, I couldn't simply attach it with the existing wire nut. I had to make my own lead. Likewise, I had to do the same for the ground since my prior switch had a ground wire attached, rather than a screw to attach a lead. Some Leviton switches have wires in the back instead of screws. That would have made it easier for me to attach the ground and neutral, but more awkward for the other wires since it's easier to attach the existing bare ends. A compromise would have worked, or they simply could have included leads in the box. Update: After about two years, my wife tried it and said that it doesn't work. Leviton support was good and told me to tap the bottom five times, and that fixed it. The switch can get disabled by mistake, which Leviton told me sometimes happens with small children who repeatedly press it a certain way, and the solution is not in the instructions, but if anything at all doesn't work with a Leviton product, call them and they can help.\n35#Sometimes manual operation is all the house provides. It adds control on the other side of the room and doesn't require any additional programming. This is super convenient when you arrive home to a wifi outage.\n36#Great companion to the Smart Home dimmer! A great companion to the Smart Home dimmer, you might need an electrician to install depending on your comfort working with electrical wiring.\n37#Get the right remote. There are different remotes for the decora series. Make sure you are ordering the correct one for your main/master switch. The remote was much easier to install than the main (which had the external wires, rather than wiring into the screws, like most switches). So definitely a positive for that. The only negative thing I have to say is that the screws for mounting into the wall box are absolute garbage. They strip almost immediately. Make sure to have extras on hand.\n38#great switch. i highly recommend it. my wife and I really like this switch in our bedroom. if we forget to turn off the bedroom light we just need to tell the light to turn off. i really like how you can adjust the maximum light setting when you hit the switch to turn on. you can also tell the lights to dim to a certain percentage. just really handy. i have LED can lights and this works great. the only issues i ran into is with 3-way switches. i didn't realize that you have 2 of the Leviton switches for a 3-way application. a main controller and remote switch. once i purchased the remote switch it was a breeze. its easy integrate into my current alexa system. good all around buy. glad we did it.\n39#Great smart dimmer for a 3-way configuration. I used this switch as a companion to the DW6HD-1BZ I purchased. Installation was straight forward and everything worked out of the box once installation was complete. This is one of the few 3-way dimmer setups that is also \"smart\". It integrates with Alexa well, and the \"My Leviton\" app made setup easy. This dimmer along with the main switch (DW6HD-1BZ) will both show the current dimming level along with the app. You are also able to set the dimming level via Alexa like any other device. I have this for an LED light fixture, and it has worked flawlessly so far. You do need to have a neutral wire available in order to install this in a 3-way setup. I highly recommend you goto the Leviton website which has an excellent installation video. It is way better than the included instructions and make installation mush easier to understand. See the DD00R-DLZ product page on the Leviton website for the video.\n40#Leviton support is what made this work. Ordered offbrand LED ceiling lights that were really easy to put in but when it came to the dimmer we went through several dimmers and returned four of them and ended up with the second choice of dinner from Levitown and their support help my daughter get it installed. Happy ending.\n41#Need this for 3-way capability. Purchased a dimmable SmartSwitch at Home Depot. Told the associate the switch was on a 3 pole switch. Told it would work fine. Well it didn't. Had to order this to make the dimmer work properly. Neither Home Depot or Lowes stock it in store so it had to be ordered. Can't believe I'm the only person who have ever tried to use a SmartSwitch with multiple switches. Both Lowes and Home Depot should stock these in store.\n42#Only bought it since I already had the master dimmer laying around. I used the master Wi-Fi dimmer in a previous installation but I now had a three-way installation I wanted to repurpose the switch for. This combination is a pain to install since it's very specific about which side the load is connected to and both switches need to be connected to hot and neutral. Only one traveller is required in this installation (I guess a plus) so I repurposed to other traveller to pull my load over to the other switch (due to the configuration). The quality of this companion dimmer is significantly inferior to the master dimmer as this really feels like cheap plastic junk. The LED indicators lag the master, controlling dimming levels has a very significant lag (hard to dial in a specific dimness from this device), and you can't turn off the dimming indicator as you can with the master. I won't be buying more of these in the future.\n43#Buyer Beware. I have 5 of these switch circuits that took a number of tries to set up the first time. Apple Home and Levitons app kept rejecting them. Finally all worked for a number of months and now 4 of my 5 switches will not respond to app commands. The app says they're not connected. I did the factory reset on all and none can be reconnected. With the 5 command switches and a few of these three-way remotes and the color faceplates, I am over $300 into this stuff and basically have switches you have to go to and physically turn on. At least that feature still works but I could have just spent $30 for manual switches. Consistently, these are of poor quality. Buyer Beware!!!!\n44#Not good with all lights. Didn’t work for my led 6”. Didn’t wanted to even turn in my lights, didn’t try any other light style or bulb since whats the point? It says dim switch so it got to be for any led light. However assuming that does not dim but at least turns the light on...anyways was past the returning time frame I guess I get to keep them may be one day they work in other lights.\n45#Love Alexa & app control; 3-way install issues. I do love phone and Alexa control. Instructions backwards for 3-way wiring led to many, MANY unnecessary trips from 2nd floor to basement and back flipping breaker on & off to test. (thankfully another review provided correct instructions). Also dimmer switch a little flimsy and keeps popping out so question durability. I mainly use voice through Alexa or app on my phone to control so hopefully won’t be an issue. I was going to replace several more switches in my house but after the difficult installation waiting to see how the dimmer switch that is popping out holds up.\n46#Don't buy this cheap mess. The core functionality is its zwave capability, and Leviton screwed that up. I have about a dozen of these, and about one fourth of them have lost their ability to talk zwave. Additionally, the physical switches are clunky. Press the button, and it will click, but if you don't press it hard enough, the light doesn't turn on, but it still clicks. You've been warned.\n47#Super switch!! I love this new dimmer switch and that it’s compatible with Alexa! That was a must when we redid our kitchen lights, and it has not disappointed once in the two months since we installed them. We have a compatible three way switch on one side of the room, and this one on the more used side, but honestly, Alexa turns them off, on, dims, and brightens for us more than we touch the switch!\n48#Perfect! As described. Great product, instructions and integration.",
