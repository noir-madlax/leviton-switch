Amazing Product Great Seller\n1#Can be glitchy. Works well most of the time can get glitchy when turning off. Otherwise works well.\n2#Works fine but no way to secure it to the base. Works fine, easy to install. Unfortunately no way to secure it to the base. We had to use a screw on top to prevent someone to slide it up. The screw looks stupid but we don’t see a different solution\n3#Check size. Works good size isn't small had to make work\n4#Best thing ever. Lifesaver instead of having to run a whole new line to power the light from another room this remote control save my back and it was easy to install\n5#No Electrician Needed-Game Changer. I am amazed.....our switch eas in the corner of the room. Hooked up this switch, placed at entryway and works perfectly. We live in the Caribbean & or house is concrete, simply running electrical is a bit more difficult. This light switch is a game changer.\n6#Worked exactly as described. Installed today so don't know how well this product does in the long term. However, in the short term... The switch was covered in the box so it would not get scratched by other pieces in the box. Was easy to install. Just make sure you know which are the hot and neutral wires when connecting this device to power. Only one complaint--instructions did not say what size drill bit was needed to install anchors in sheet rock. I used anchors that I already had and knew the size drill bit needed.\n7#Great wireless switch. Works great for my application\n8#Easy to install. Works perfect! So happy. No more reaching way behind the cabinet to turn on the light!\n9#Producto excelente. Producto muy funcional y excelente\n10#Connection issues when mounted to wall. Switch works fine when it’s not mounted to the wall, when I mount it to the wall, the connections stop working, I bought four of these, and they all have the same issues.\n11#Awesome. Amazing product. Love how easy it was to install and make life so much easier.. Definitely will be buying more\n12#Works remarkably well! Liked the fact it was so easy to install (15min). Works flawless.\n13#Good customer service but questionable product. Update: After my review, customer service contacted me and gave me a refund. Well done on that front so I'll add 2 more stars. Doesn't make me think any better of the product, but it's handled by good people. Maybe I just had a dud given the other positive comments; however, it's not a product I recommend. Original review: Complete waste of money. Worked intermittently. Sometimes it would click on immediately, other times very slowly, then other times not at all. And it's not like you can trouble shoot in an app. You simply have no idea why it's not working. Unfortunately, I ordered a couple weeks before it was actually installed in my new light, and by the time I'd had 2 weeks of it not working as expected and getting fed up and removing it, it's outside the return window. Don't make the same mistake. Don't buy.\n14#Not great. The switch part doesn't switch smoothly. Have to hit the switch 3, 4 times to get it off.\n15#Unreliable turning off the light. They have great range when turning on by pretty dice for turning them off. I think LED lights that have switching regulators inside produce wide band interference that blocks the RF off signal.\n16#Frustrating waste of money. I installed this for a simple garage light near a back entry. It works intermittenly. Most of the time you can get it to turn on after a few trys but turning it off seems to be the real problem. I installed the switch only 12 feet away from the reciever but it does not work consistently. Its a particularly frustrating when trying to shut things down for the night and your there trying to turn it off over and over. I moved it to 8 feet away and it still could not work as advertized. Making a remote light switch is not a new technology and should not be a difficult task for a decently equipped company. Don't waste your money get a better brand.\n17#Troubleshooting. READ THIS TROUBLESHOOTING TIP: If after installing the wireless switch to control a light fixture it turns ON but not OFF or it requires many pushes off etc. AND you are using an LED light bulb, remove the LED bulb and try an incandescent bulb. If it is now reliable and you still want to use an LED purchase a \"dimmable\" bulb. I've had good luck with Phillips bulbs. These are semiconductor switches and there is a technical reason they don't work well with LED bulbs.\n18#GREAT!! I have bought quite a few of these switches and they all work great.\n19#works great. I liked the ease of installing this switch and the fact that it works.\n20#Works. Not a really positive click off and on And you need to click it several times to go off\n21#Electrical Device Sturdy. Good Device- not meant for Old house wiring. Good directions\n22#Works great. Working as expected\n23#Wireless switch works like a charm. Switch was extremely easy to wire up and worked fantastic.\n24#Delay in turning off. Light switch doesn't turn off right away most of the time. You have to click off multiple time so Kate's can turn off.\n25#DOA. Ordered one of these and a ceiling light to replace a closet light with pull chain. And the unit was dead on arrival. I have purchased one of these and their plug style for another room previously without issue. I ordered a second to replace this failed unit as replacement would take longer and it too was DOA. I would say they have serious QC issues and do not recommend this product.\n26#Junk. Just like the other reviews it only works some times\n27#Easy to install, works great. I have a light switch that is inconveniently located in a bookcase and is covered by books. I did not want to relocate this light switch, so I bought this remote light switch so I could access the covered switch. This remote works great! It has a low profile so while it does not lay flat like a normally installed light switch, it only protrudes about 1/2” but doesn’t look out of place. The transmitter needed to be hard wired in place of my covered switch, but if you know how to install an outlet or switch, it is very easy to do. You will want a face plate to cover the transmitter.\n28#Off works intermittently. The on button works just fine, but I have to click 8-10 times for off to work.\n29#Excellent! Easy install and setup. Rectangular box is perfect size to conceal inside light fixture. Didn’t read instructions and installed in no time. Included hardware is all you need for installation. Love the movable switch. Excellent for upgrading basement fixtures with pull chains and eliminate extra electrical wiring and switches. Also gives flexibility to place switch wherever you want without cutting sheet rock, walls, or wall studs.\n30#Switch works intermittently. I bought 4 of these with the goal of being able to remotely operate four fixtures. I installed the first, and found it worked intermittently. It could turn the light on and off, much of the time, but often required multiple attempts. Occasionally, it would not operate at all. Since I intended to install four switches, I decided to try a second one, and maybe it would work perfectly. But it worked more or less like the first switch. Operations succeeded intermittently, but failures were not identical to the failures of the first switch. Then I looked at the reviews more carefully. Reviews ranking the product from 1 to 3 stars almost always cited the intermittent behavior. This convinced me that the product design was inherently at fault. I returned all four switches, including two remaining that I not bothered to open and test. I wanted remote switches that worked perfectly. Intermittent behavior is not acceptable. My recommendation is to avoid this product until a new product replaces this one, and the new product corrects the intermittent failures of the present product.\n31#Works like it is supposed to. Was easy to hook up. The control box is small so it fits in pretty small places. I used it to add a switch to an outdoor floodlight that was hardwired and always on. This did the trick. Now the light is only on when i want it.\n32#very good material. Easy to install\n33#range sucks. After installing the module it worked great until I walked about 6 feet away and it would not shut off. :( I tried everything but replacing the battery and the red light in the center of switch works everytime u push the button. If i shut off power it will turn on everytime but not off.\n34#Not functioning as advertised; Starts but you have to point the switch to the lamp and keep pushing to turn off\n35#Spotty connection. I've had this installed for a few months. Half the time it works on the first try. The other half the time I have to press the switch a few times to get the light to turn off. The switch is located about a foot from the sensor so I don't think it should really have a problem.\n36#I'm sold. My first time installing one of these (and installing a junction box and wiring) This saved me so much time. Would have been much more difficult to run a line off the switched circuit. I got the 15A just to be safe even tho it will stay way below that with LED bulbs. At first I installed it backwards with the load to the black wire but on this device the red goes to the load blue to N\n37#Put a switch anywhere. Hate pulling wires? Want a switch on your nightstand because you're sick and tired of clapping to turn the lights on? This is the switch for you. Super convenient and works perfectly.\n38#Life saver. Our new shop is in a very old building, built by leprechauns apparently as all the light switches were a foot off the ground. I'm 6'2\". I was not going to be bending over for every light switch for eternity and needing to stretch and touch my toes every morning before I could turn the lights on at worm. Every switch got replaced with these. Miracle workers! We even were able to put 2 in the ceiling at the junction box and split up some of the lights, so I can have all the main room lights on at once or only half. These are amazing and surprisingly simple to install and program to the switches.\n39#Poor distance. Stronger battery made no difference. The receiver does not get the signal even from 4 feet away unless the switch is removed from wall and pointed at it. In other words. This item is completely useless for its intended purpose. Spend a few $ more for something better.\n40#A simple and effective solution for adding a switch operating multiple power cords. This product can be successfully used for installing a switch operating multiple lights, in my case located under multiple kitchen cabinets, without running cables in the walls. It is imperative to recognize that a distance between the switch and the receivers has to be minimized and tested, as the RF signal is not meant to penetrate through walls or over extended distances. Again, in my case, the best location for the receivers was above the switch or it would not pick up the signal on each attempt to turn the circuit on and off.\n41#Had to remove it... At first, I thought it was working well. But for some reason, it would not always turn on or off the lights. Finally, I removed it from the switch, and it's just been sitting collecting dust.\n42#a little large but does it's job. My house is rather old and the ceiling light power box isn't connected to the wall switch in my room. instead of rewiring the romex to run through the light switch into the ceiling fixture, get this which will wirelessly switch on and off the ceiling light so you can get a smaller cordless ceiling light and use the remote to turn it on and off. the little housing of the circuit board is cumbersome and can take a little too much space in the ceiling box so I took the board out and it saved enough space so that I could get a thin ceiling light and still have it wirelessly connected. That being said, sometimes the remote can't reach the board and you'll have to aim the remote at certain spots to reach the controller but when it works, it works.\n43#These small RF switches and receiver kits work just as stated. These are used to control separate 8’ led light fixtures independent of each other even though they are wired on the same power source.\n44#Cable to short. How possible to connect this cable within and inch ?\n45#Switch sometimes stop working. Price is good and easy to install but the switch keep freezing\n46#Very Inconsistent Connection. It may be something to do with the installation but the connection is extremely inconsistent and not very good. Have to find something else to replace this as it is unusable.\n47#Remote Switch DID NOT WORK. I received this in the original box that seemed just fine. I hooked it up as per the installation instructions but it did not work. I verified power to the receiver but to no avail, nothing. NO customer service, no help and now have to waste my time and return the $14.00 item. As per the instructions, resetting the receiver should have made the LED indicator light flash. It didn't. Crappy item from a bad seller.",
