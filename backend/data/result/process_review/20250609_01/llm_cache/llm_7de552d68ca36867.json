I need to update my review. I gave a one because I believed this item was missing from my order, but I had mistaken the package as batteries that came with another one of my orders. My mistake! They are very nice looking, but I'm in the middle of a remodel so I will not be connecting them for a while so I do not know how well they work yet, but they do look very nice.\n1#Nice gold color. Love the look of these switches. I bought 3. They were easy to install. Would recommend.\n2#These look yellow. They look yellow and not gold\n3#OVERALL. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase. The item met my expectations, and the entire transaction process was smooth. I would recommend this product and seller to others, based on this positive experience.\n4#Just enough glitz. At first I was disappointed. Once I installed the switch and put the cover on *magic* It's just fancy enough while still being in the background, not steal the spotlight of the wall. I will be changing all our light switches to these as our renovations continue. Goes perfect with the cover plate.\n5#Sleek look, function well, resist fingerprints. I have a house full of boys on most days and they are somehow always covered in grease and dirt. I was concerned that with this style of light switch it would show streaks on the wider space. It doesn’t!! It is a beautiful gold color. These were easy to install and great quality for the money! I love the plug cover on the inside as these are in my bathroom. I don’t fear moisture sneaking in! Love these outlets.\n6#Work very well. It’s solid construction, not flimsy at all. the color match the outlet cover. The sound when switching is clear and loud, I like this sound, some people might not like it.\n7#Doesn't work. These light switch doesn't like up in dark like ots suppose to do\n8#Excelente. Muy buen producto\n9#Good quality. Good quality easy to install\n10#Fake color. Don't even bother to buy is not even close to gold color !\n11#Switches. Function great look great match my plate almost perfectly\n12#EXCELLENT product. Goes well with my new brass wall switch plate\n13#Outlet switch. Very good product I like it\n14#Cheap Garbage. The brushed gold finish looks nice but the lightswitch is very cheaply made. Lasted approximately 4 months until one day I flipped my bathroom switch on and it fell off. The piece inside that controls the light also fell out so I can't use my bathroom light until I get a replacement. And it certainly won't be this one.\n15#Hermosos. Encargue mas de 10 para la remodelacion completa de mis baños y quedaron perfectos con los acesorios q estoy comprando muy recomendables\n16#Decent product, bad color. Did not look good with 100% brass cover plates. Too pale. Did not use for my project.\n17#Me encantó. Esta super bellooo y tiene un dorado q me encanta\n18#Over priced. Funny color\n19#Good quality finish on paint. Easy to install and good quality finish\n20#So easy to install! So easy to install! My first time and it was quick and easy!\n21#Beautiful addition. The product did exactly was it was supposed to i had an electrician install but it’s beautiful\n22#They look so good! I knew that they would be perfect for the space! They were so easy to install and I'm 100% happy with them.\n23#its perfect color. i like the color that gives contrast to a white wall and can also make screw less plate. i wish price is cheaper. It is branded product and they changed the color. I wish company can make it more cheaper, taking fact that plain white switch even with screw less plate is less than half price\n24#Contemporary Look! Exactly what I wanted. Brushed gold look to match my bath fixtures. Easy to install.\n25#Awesome! Great item to use when dressing up a room. Very easy to install.\n26#Wonderful! I liked this item because it was both efficient and attractive as advertised!\n27#No where near gold color. These are not even close the the color gold. They are a light almond color. There is no metallic quality to them. They are just a flat tan or almond color.\n28#Light Switch. Product as described, look very nice and makes a nice improvement compared to the original whites switches\n29#Overall great product. Simple installation, pretty resistant to scratching (slipped with the screwdriver a few times) and the finished product looks very clean. Was hoping for more of a gold tone, but these will do nicely. Would purchase again.\n30#Looks and works great. Super easy to install and looks great in our remodeled bath. Feels kind of cheap, but does the trick.\n31#Just ok. So I bought these because of the good reviews, but they do not look good to me. I know it's plastic, but I was hoping it had more of a metal look. It doesn't. It just looks like cheap plastic to me. I'll keep them for now but I will be replacing them soon.\n32#Nice and elegant. I really like this item. I put up new wallpaper and I accented the light switch with this and a gold cover plate. It really looks nice and elegant. So nice, I am ordering more to go in the other rooms in my home. Very easy to install. Only took me about 5 mins. to install. Looks great and worth the price.\n33#Good quality. Great color, subtle gold that looks metal. Good quality product\n34#one bad, one OK. Bought 2. One worked, one didn't. However bought another one as it's the only game in town for what I'm looking for.\n35#Great product. Easy to install and great value for the price\n36#Brown, not gold. Mediocre plastic, not metal. Wouldn’t buy again. These aren’t gold finish at all. They’re a matte brown. You may as well spray paint your own, especially for this premium price. They’re just plastic, and the rocker switch feels cheap. I wouldn’t buy again. Honestly just spray paint a higher quality switch or plate - that’s all this is.",
