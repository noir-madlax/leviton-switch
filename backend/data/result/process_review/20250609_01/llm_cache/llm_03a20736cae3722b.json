The product removed the screw terminals, I assume to cut cost. The problem if you have small electrical boxes is that now you need to at least 3-4 connectors inside to connect them, Leviton already taking up a lot of room in the box, so I have 2-3 1 gang fittings where these simply don't fit. All their previous gear had screw connectors, kind of sneaky since they don't seem to call it out on the box either.\n1#great. worked well with my Samsung SS - Zwave hub\n2#Better button-feel than Zooz. I use Zooz for my outdoor houselights on a timer. Tried Leviton ON/OFF (non-dimmer) switch to control an outlet, with the 3-way auxiliary installed as well. Both the aux and this switch have a superior sound and feel when physically pressed compared to zooz. Considering using this for my other often-used switches just for that even though the price is almost double.\n3#Only Z-Wave switch rated for 15 Amp outlets. This is the only Z-Wave switch rated to control standard 15A outlets. There are also no Z-Wave controlled outlets that have a load output that can control other outlets. I used this to replace a UPB-controlled outlet that did have a load output. It fed 4 normal duplex outlets in a 1/2 switched configuration.\n4#Easy to install and setup. Easy to setup, works as intended. Installed on front porch light and made it \"Smart\" and hooked up with camera sensor. Now my porch light acts as motion sensing light.\n5#Works well, missing English instructions in the box though. Works well but the most recent one had no english instructions. Spanish and French language instruction sheets were in the box though. The English language one was available on the Leviton web site though. The wire leads on the switch are long enough for most applications but I would have preferred traditional screw terminals for a cleaner installation but I'm sure the wire leads help keep the cost down. Overall it's fine as a basic z-wave switch. It doesn't seem to support any kind of multi-tap functions (like Zooz devices) but for an on-off switch it works fine. The current rating for LED lights is considerably higher than alternative products as well which was my main reason for buying this model.\n6#Not worth it. WARNING: Does not work in a 3-way circuit as advertised without the companion switch which also costs a lot. You better of getting the tplink ones that cost 8 times less and work even better. Unreliable, I installed it in a shed and that was apparently too far away for the Hub to pick it up. Then, tried to install it in a 3-way and that does not work since I didn't have the companion switch. Then, installed in another room.. Pairing is very fiddly with Smartthings are seemed unreliable at times. For something as simple as a light switch I expected a lot more from Leviton, and a lot less expensive... Unfortunately with all the re-installs I can't get a refund so this is now garbage.\n7#Not best product. It not best product it okay have little bit buggy for when using paddle switch but it fine to use controller hub I e-mail to Leviton Support for new firmware but i stilling not getting new firmware i think they can't figure out I don't recommend if using paddle switch unless just controller hub only\n8#I do not trust Leviton anymore. Leviton was my go to brand for my home automation Z-wave switches and dimmers. NOT ANYMORE. I have purchased Leviton Z-wave ON-OFF switch model ZW15S. Switch will not turn off at times when bottom of the paddle is pressed. Its a random thing. I have powered the switch off-on with breaker and performed reset to factory default. Neither helped. Thinking this may be one odd defective switch I have ordered replacement. New switch will now do complete opposite and will not turn on at random times. I'm an electrical engineer by trace and I can assure you that it is not a wiring issue. Z-wave connection and control worked fine. Manual paddle control does not. Although I have not experienced any issues with Leviton z-wave dimmers this is no longer my go to brand. Makes me think where they make these switches nowadays.\n9#Wire leads. Small problem, these switches have wire leads that are marretted to the house leads. Would prefer switches with screw harness only as it can get fairly tight in the box with the extra length of wire. Other than that, switches are great.\n10#Works well and integrates perfectly with Smartthings. Installation was fairly straightforward. Only issue I had and still don’t understand is a warning from Smartthings that the connection was not as secure as it should be. I could not find the reasoning and left it as is. It however works perfectly.\n11#Can't seam to be able to connect to my Canada telus Adt. I have tried several times to connect to our ADT security. I will keep on trying. The small manual says it should connect but not as let\n12#Z wave compatible. Easy to connect with z wave system and easy to install.",
