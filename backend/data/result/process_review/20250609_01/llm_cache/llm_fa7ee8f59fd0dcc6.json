I’m really impressed with the ELEGRP Dimmer Switch, Touch Dimmer Light Switch. It has a sleek, shallow profile compared to the dimmer I replaced. The switch operates smoothly and has a modern, elegant look. I also love that it remembers the last dimmer setting when you turn it off and on. The build quality feels just as good, if not better, than the more expensive name-brand dimmers that look similar. Plus, there’s no flickering of the light. It comes with a decorative plate, though I didn’t use it since my previous dimmer was installed in a duplex J-box. Overall, I highly recommend this dimmer switch for anyone looking for a quality, easy-to-install, and user-friendly option.\n1#Touch dimmer function is smooth and continuous... I like this version of ELEGRP Dimmer Switch better than the other version with a + and - sign. The quiet operation on this Touch Dimmer Light Switch is much smoother and continuous...no need to press it multiple times...just press and hold to brighten or dim light. Installation was easy and the Matte White screwless cover plate looks clean and modern. I bought quite many more to replace all the dimmers in my home.\n2#works well. Though this isn't a smart switch, this dimmer switch upgrade works well for our needs. We've been doing an update to all of our new home's light switches to make them a cleaner rocker/decorator style. I like that this switch comes with the plate, and the whole look is clean and modern. The dimming function works really well and the fact it can be installed single pole and 3-way makes the decision to order that much easier.\n3#Fancy looking and well made. This dimmer looks really fancy and futuristic and seems to be very well made. The on/off switch part has a nice soft click to it when you press and lets you know you pressed it enough to turn the light on or off. I love the touch slide dimmer function, very cool! No mechanical slider to mess with. But remember you absolutely MUST have a neutral wire in your light switch for this to work, whether in 3-way or single pole mode. So open up your current switch and check for a white neutral wire before you order this switch. Easy to install, comes with everything you need but a screwdriver.\n4#sets the mood. loved this feature, great find for me\n5#Works as it's intended too. I used this switch to replace a standard one after replacing my kitchen light with a dimmable model. The dimmer feature seems to work fine, and the switch looks nice. The style matches all my other switches and outlets. Installation was similar to any other switch and was not difficult. I like that the switch came with stickers to label my wires and the switch itself was well labeled. You will require a ground to use the switch so ensure your intended outlet does have a ground wire as well.\n6#Received defective switch (video). After installing the switch according to included instructions, the switch does not work. It causes the lights to violently flicker and will not increase in brightness from the minimum setting. I think I received a defective product and would like a replacement.\n7#Appear nicer in photo. They did not function correctly, it was the the dimming feature wouldn’t working up or down. They required a neutral which made it more difficult to install. They looked nice, but they weren’t even worth the value of money I spent on them. The build quality seemed mid. I heard no noise from switching these.\n8#Good Dimmer Replacement. This ELEGRP touch dimmer switch is excellent for controlling LED lights smoothly. Installation was straightforward, and it works for both single-pole and 3-way setups, which was a nice surprise. The touch sensitivity is responsive, and it’s easy to adjust brightness levels. It includes a wall plate, has a modern matte white finish, and needs a neutral wire, which is common in newer homes. I’m impressed with its performance and style — great for modern lighting control!\n9#Worked great for two days then stopped. when I want to increase the light intensity it jumps back to the lowest dim level. It’s not functioning correctly which is very disappointing.\n10#Nice looking dimmer. The installation video on the product page provides detailed explanations, which is a plus. The color label also helps to prevent mistakes and mishaps with the switch. The instructions are clear and easy to read. The switch has a fancy design, but I didn't like the cheap feeling of it. The dish-shaped contour, smooth surface, and no-screw face plate are good design features, but the touch made me think it's a cheap device. For $20, it is what it is. Everything works, but the dimmer LED remains lit.\n11#looks great, dimmer is a bit tricky. Easy to install, it comes with instructions and wire nuts. I really like that the end of the the wires have the insulation precut so all you have to do is pull that little bit off and hook up to your wiring. I didn't use the 3 way feature, so I just capped that wire off. There's no sounds when clicking the switch on and off. In order for the dimmer function to work your finger needs to be on the switch and on the dimmer part for it to respond. Took me a second to figure that out. You install a plastic mounting bracket, and then the face plate clips on to it. It gives the exterior a nice smooth look without seeing any screws\n12#ELEGRP Touch Dimmer Light Switch (Single Pole & 3 Way, Matte White). The ELEGRP Touch Dimmer Switch is a sleek, modern way to control lighting in your home. It works with both single pole and 3-way setups and is compatible with LED lights up to 150W or incandescent/halogen bulbs up to 450W. The switch includes a wall plate, and the neutral wire requirement makes installation straightforward if your wiring supports it. The touch functionality is responsive, and the dimming range works well. Given the UL listing and its solid performance, it provides good value for a reliable lighting upgrade.\n13#Touch functionality is spotty. I like the look of these, but the touch functionality isn't as good as I'd expected. The dimming can sometimes be jumpy. I also feel the LED is a bit too bright when the light is off. I wish there was a way to dim that too.\n14#Stylish dimming switch. I have other #Elegrp products throughout my home and when I was looking for a dimmer switch for an LED fixture, I thought I'd give this one a try. Installation was very easy but if you're not comfortable dealing with high voltage electrical lines, hire an electrician. Once installed, you're greeted with a slick, small LED light bar that runs vertically along the right side of the rocker switch. To brighten or dim the light, just run your finger up or down the light bar. That's it. Very cool. Turning the light on is almost like other rocker switches. I say almost because you can't just push the switch anywhere. I find it works best when you press the top left or bottom right of the switch. Even with that slight quirk, this touch sensitive dimmer switch is great. It also works as a night light because the LED light bar is always illuminated showing the dimming percent.\n15#Looks nice, works well. This dinner switch installed easily and works as expected. It comes with a nice faceplate that pops on without exposed screws, but it has a stepped design that doesn't seem likely to match most existing faceplates.\n16#Very smooth and easy to install. This switch has high quality finish. It's very smooth to operate. Also, compared with many other dimmers, this one is very compact in the back, so it's fairly easy to install. This is critical if the electric box is not big enough.\n17#Working as expected. Well made. Replaced my old one which causses light bulb flickers. The light can be dimmer perfectly, no flicker.\n18#Works smoothly. I installed the Dimmer Switch for my LED lights, and it's been a great upgrade. The touch dimmer is smooth and responsive, allowing precise control over the light levels. It works perfectly with both single pole and 3 way setups, which was a bonus for my home configuration. The installation was straightforward, though it does require a neutral wire, so double-check your wiring before purchasing. The wall plate included is a nice touch, and the overall look is clean and modern and it does fit perfectly.\n19#One of the Best Looking \"Non-Smart\" Dimmers Out There. VERY slick looking (and working) Decora-style dimmer switch. Dimming function is embedded into the right side of the paddle - it's touch sensitive. It's the nicest \"non-smart\" dimmer I've found to date. Installation is a straighforward 4- or 5-wire arrangement, including the required neutral. I'm not a fan of the screwless plate provided. It looks nice, but doesn't match anything else in the house. (And in most of cases, the switch is going in a multi-switch gang anyway.) At the current sub-$20 price point, this is a great choice for anyone in the market for \"plain old\" Decora stye dimmers.\n20#Quality LED Dimmer. These ELEGRP dimmer switches are consistently high quality and they work well in my experience. This switch has not been an exception. it works well and it has a high quality feel to it. It inspires confidence installing this into my home\n21#Impressive packaging. UL listed. I've received a lot of wall switches and unfortunately a lot of them lack the certification required that allows us to install them here in the states. This touch sensitive dimmer switch was very nicely packaged. It included instructions wire nuts screws and a wall plate. The UL certification was on the back of the product but it was in the form of a sticker. I would rather see it embossed on the product but I will accept this as it is. Its capabilities are just like any other wall switch controlling up to 450 watts incandescent or 150 watts LED. I have the three way version which I can install both as a single pole or a three way switch. Cheers\n22#May not work for everyone. I tried several different ways to connect this but it didn’t work for me. It seemed to be a well made light switch and the dimmer worked fine. The 3 way control just didn’t seem to work. It’s unfortunate because it looks nice and modern.\n23#NICE ESSY TO INSTALL DIMMER SWITCH. At $20, this easy to install dimmer switch is thin in appearance to keep a low and seamless profile on your wall to look nice and can be easy to control with an on/off switch and a thin dimmer bar for brightness that goes up and down. For the value it is of good quality and is holding up fairly well!\n24#Excellent dimmer. Easy installation, smooth travel on the touch controls, handsome.\n25#Nice switch and good instructions. Make sure you note this is a 3 way switch. That means you will need two of them. Also this switch requires a white neutral wire which most of the time is not run through a light switch wall box. You also must have the necessary wires run between the two light switch wall boxes. This is a good looking well made light switch. The cover plate fits nice. The unit comes with good instructions.\n26#Worked good. Looks good and does what is supposed to do. It was easy to install and seems to be well made. The dimmer is nice as well.",
