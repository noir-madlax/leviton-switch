Exactly what I needed\n1#Four-Way Lighted Switch: Performance & Feel. The four-way lighted switch works well. It’s gently lit, so it’s not too bright but still easy to find in the dark. Compared to the three-way lighted switches, it’s a bit stiffer and not as smooth when flipping on and off. At first, I thought it was defective and ordered a replacement, but the new one was just as stiff. So I decided to keep the original. It does the job and works as expected.\n2#Nice. Put them in the hallway. Perfect.\n3#Wonderful, New Item. If you have trouble finding the light switch at night well these are for you. Easy to find for kids or anyone looking to turn the lights on in the dark. Easy to install.\n4#Works well. Installed easily. Switch feels sturdy when switching between on and off. Not too loud. White light in the switch took a bit of time to get used to, since older (non-LED) lighted switches had more of an orange light. Brightness is good. Has only been in service for about 2 months, so I can't comment on long-term durability yet.\n5#Hard to find 4-way lighted switch. Works great, hard to find except on Amazon.\n6#Nice switch. Nice switch, easy to install, location light is not too bright and is a nice color. Gives off just enough light to easily locate the switch at night. I have purchased a few of these now and they all work great.\n7#Okay but expensive. Seems to be okay- it was installed yesterday. Not crazy about the price-don’t see motion detection on mine.\n8#Nice Switch, Amazon only Part. This 4 way switch matches all my other Leviton illuminated switches, and has the white LED. It functions great and looks nice as well. Amazon is the only place to carry this. The switch is pricey imo, hence the 1 star knocked off.\n9#Not bright. Not as bright as I`d hoped, but enough to see it in a very dark hallway.\n10#Light isn’t very bright. The led light isn’t very bright behind the plastic. Works well enough.\n11#Great product, white night light. Great product which has a white night night, not the orange.\n12#Lighted 4-way rocker switch does the job - double-check the wiring configuration! We replaced an existing non-lighted 4-way switch with this one. The old switch had inputs on top and outputs on bottom. This switch has the inputs on the left side and the outputs on the right. So you can't necessarily install the new switch wire-for-wire if you're removing an old one. It's easy if you note the labeling on the switch itself compared to the old one and follow included instructions. We like the light-level on the switch; it's not a night-light, but you can see the switch at the end of a dark hall. Medium click-sound; not too intrusive.\n13#Loud click to turn on...not bright enough. Installed this. It makes a loud clicking noise when switched on/off. I wish it were brighter. But the noise to turn on/off when used in a hallway FOR NIGHT, should be silent. No worries installation was good.\n14#Works fine. This 4-way lighted switch works great. White LED seems the appropriate brightness in the dark. Turns off when light turns on. Very nice improvement.\n15#Love the night light. Perfect for our mud room near the back door. Easy install too\n16#Worth the Money. A little more money however definitely worth it. Love the backlit feature\n17#Be patient. Great product, very thick rear piece, make sure wires are clear before pushing back all the way.\n18#Doesn’t illuminate. False advertising. This does not illuminate.\n19#Works like it should. For some unknown reason, the builder installed FIVE switches for the kitchen lights, all in multi-gang switch plates. Each of the load and line switches are 3-way and the other three are 4-way. I replaced the original non-lit switches in the 4-way and will get 2 more for the 3-way and just wire them for 3-way operation. With these, the white illumination is on regardless of switch positions so it easy to identify them from the other switches in the plate. They wire a bit differently, just read the directions.\n20#Came cracked. Came cracked of no use!\n21#Classy Touch! Works as expected. Quality materials. Easy install to replace existing Hall Wall Switches (4way + two 3way switches in total) - It is a classy touch for the kids/guests to find hallway switches in the dark. Worth the extra money for these upgrades.\n22#Works well. Works well, overpriced though.\n23#Good. Works as advertised\n24#It may not look good but it works. While the switch does light up a bit it's very dim with no adjustment. It also shines through the plastic switch where the internal parts cast shadows so the illuminated area is not at all uniform and so looks cheap. I was hoping for something a bit brighter (or adjustable) that is not illuminated 24/7 but just at night and more aesthetic.",
