We purchased one of these at a local big-box hardware store. First problem, loosening the connection screws required a heavy-duty Phillips and tremendous effort. The factory had torqued those in at an unbelievable tightness. Second problem, with connection screws backed out, the easily come all the way out. Then the threaded piece inside moves away from the hole, requiring one to twist the damned thing around in space to position it to start the screw. Then we find that our u-shaped wire ends which worked fine on reasonable dimmers and switches, were extremely difficult to place under the limited height of the retained screws. Adding insult to injury, the side terminal totally refused to accept its mating screw. Almost dangerously close to thinking it was started, but placed toward the wall it popped out. I have installed countless wall switches and dimmers, The device will have to be returned. Lowes and Eaton have no easy review/complaint path for warning their customers. I will never trust any Eaton device after this.\n1#Just what I needed. Perfect. Easy to use. Easy to install. Dimms the lights just right doesn't have any background noise or unwanted flickering\n2#Good product. Expensive, arrived on time. However delivery was not at front door. It was my backdoor. Took me awhile to find the package.\n3#Great value. Shipped fast. This dimmer works great. Fantastic value.\n4#It worked for an hour or so. We had a slider just like this controlling our dimmable LED lights, and we bought this to replace it when it stopped working after years of service. This was appropriate to handle the minimal load for these lights, yet they flickered off and on the same day it was installed. The replacement does not. Back this went for refund.\n5#Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Hard to tell by any of the packaging or instructions, but this will turn the light off completely when fully lowered to the bottom. The slide acts as both the switch and the dimmer. This was not super evident from what I read, but that is exactly what I was looking for. This was a super low cost option that is functional.\n6#Work great - great price. Work like a charm!\n7#Good dimmers. Good dimmers. No problems\n8#Easily gets dirty. It works well but gets very dirty when pulling up a down as opposed to touch and tap position ones .\n9#PROS and CONS. CONS: After setting it up to come on half-bright when motion is detected, the light flashes and then comes on. This is very annoying. It is driving two dimable LED bulbs. Sometimes it comes on quickly, other times there is a significant lag before coming on. Instructions for setting the dim level on motion is unclear ! Undefined terms. PROS: Thinking.\n10#Outstanding. Wow...as a dimmer freak...this is the most pleasant! From off to full on it has a soft quick but gradual light...like a one second from dark to bright...easy on the eyes...kind of hard to explain..quality item. Easy to find toggle switch.\n11#Good for price. Cheaper than the big box stores and does its job.",
