After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the LED Illuminated Indicator Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a.

The backlight is constantly on, regardless of whether the switch is on or off.\n1#Love it! SO much better-now we can see the light switch in our basement!!\n2#Not very useful. The description says \"it is easy to locate in a dark room\". Not, it is not. You can't really see it until you're standing right in front of it. It's nowhere near as good as other lighted switches I've installed over the years. This is pretty much just ... a switch -- at three times the price of an ordinary switch.\n3#Now I see my switch. Works well in the dark where my switch is. Now mama can find it in the dark.\n4#Incorrect and incomplete documentation; could not get it to work. Instructions are incorrect (e.g. connectors are drawn in the wrong location). Instructions say that another neutral line is needed, but no instructions given as to how to supply this. I was able to install the product and get it to work successfully as a 3 way switch, but was not able to get the night light working (which was the only reason I bought the product).\n5#It's a switch. It works as it should.\n6#Internal Led. I bought two of these for two different installs. Both switches work fine but one after some use has the LED on full time regardless of the state of the circuit.\n7#Toggle is not illuminated. The only light comes from an LED behind the bezel and is not uniform looking. Light source should be inside the toggle itself. White LED may not be suitable for sleeping areas. Watch for quality control as some arrived defective.\n8#Stopped working after 3 months. Switch stopped working after 3 months.\n9#very little light. Doesn't throw off nearly enough light, even in pitch black.\n10#It's Leviton. It lights up. Not much to say because Leviton has been doing this for 118+ years; plenty of time to get it right. The night light works well; it's a dim white-blue and the switch paddle is clear. Silent switch, and it works well as a 2-way.\n11#High quality switch that should last a long time. The lighted surround is fine - it can be easily seen in the dark and it is not too bright. Overall, I have installed 5 of these switches - 4 were single poles. Overall, a good value that is an upgrade over builder's grade junk.\n12#High-quality switch. Replaced a problem switch - this one works well, and also is illuminated at night.\n13#Replacement For Older Switches. Worked as expected\n14#Good replacement switch. The illumination on the switch stays on all the time weather on or off\n15#3 way works fine. Light not what expected. I expected that the lamp would be in the toggle. Not the case. It's ok but not what I hoped.\n16#Do his purpose. Do his purpose a little light make a little easy to find.\n17#Didn’t like. Did not like\n18#Very Nice. Very nice 3-way illuminated toggle switch. Easy to install, and it feels really durable. 1st photo during daytime and 2nd photo shows how bright the switch is at night. I plan to purchase a clear (wallpaper) switchplate to really brighten up the dark upstairs hallway. Thanks Amazon for offering a really nice and inexpensive item. A+\n19#Better than anticipated. Toggle switch is sturdy and we’ll made. Side screws are easy to turn and tighten up nicely. Around the toggle switch there is a light. Would buy more if needed.\n20#Great in a dark hallway. I got 2 of these for our hallway that has complicated wood molding so you could never find that d*** light switch, until now. And they aren't annoyingly bright, just right- blue/white light. Goes off when you turn the light on.\n21#Made in the USA. The Leviton name speaks for itself, yes. But, now its my turn. Everything Leviton I have purchased as I make improvements to my home work perfectly. These illuminated switches work perfectly. Because I am familiar with the company and where these switches are made, I install their electrical switches with confidence and the pride a homeowner should feel when you (me) buy the good stuff.\n22#Love them. Wish they were a tad brighter but I still love them\n23#illuminated toggle. not much of illumination,,,the toggle is not illuminated, just around the base of the toggle\n24#Come towards the light! Helps guide you to the light",
