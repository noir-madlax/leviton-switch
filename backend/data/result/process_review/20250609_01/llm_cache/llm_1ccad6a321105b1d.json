After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the LED Optimized Dimmer Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The LED Optimized Dimmer Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>.

Love the fact that these satin(matte) black outlets/switches match all the other fixtures and accessories that are matte black!\n1#So far working very well. The product description states ... So far working very well. The product description states CFL/LED but I have it connected to Incandescent recessed lights and no issue. Slide bar a bit delicate so I'm being very careful.\n2#Essential for dimming LED bulbs. LED bulbs are an awesome way to green up something you use every day, and dimming is great to save energy and adjust the mood. But older dimmers don't like LED bulbs. This allows you to set the dimming thresholds perfectly for your bulbs. Easy to install and setup with a little knowledge and the included instructions.\n3#I HAVE THE POWER OF LIGHT! Lutron Diva LED+ Dimmer for Dimmable LED, Halogen and Incandescent Bulbs | Single-Pole or 3-way. This unit was installed today (Jan. 08, 2025) and looks very nice on my kitchen wall. I chose the midnight black, just be aware that it does not come with a wall plate, you need that, and it's an extra cost, I chose the matching wall plate, midnight black. This dimmer switch comes in many different colours and so does the wall plates, you can mix and match if you want to. At the moment I am a very happy customer.",
