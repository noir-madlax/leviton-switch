Cuando me di cuenta que era defectuoso de origen, ya habian pasado las horas que tienes para devolverlo. Conclusion: pesimo respaldo posventa\n1#Hi quality easy to install. I recommend recommended. Fast omg its took 4 hours to get it\n2#what is needed. yes exactly I wanted n needed\n3#Don’t buy. Stopped working after 2 months. Complete crap.\n4#Awesome. Great product, Easy to install, works great.\n5#Item seemed to arc. After install. The item was tested and worked great. After the install was complete. I used the remote to turn the fixture on, and there was a pop and a flash and the item didn't turn on\n6#Hard to turn on. It was easy to install and it works. The only thing I have found that is a little disappointing is that it is hard to turn on. You have to press very hard and hold it to turn it on. Once you finally get it turned on it is easy to turn off.\n7#Decepción doble. Es una lástima que no pueda terminar mi trabajo por un switch que ya he comprado dos veces y me hace lo mismo., enciende y luego no apaga. El primero nunca apagó la lámpara led de pared, y el segundo la apaga a veces; mayormente no la apaga. He perdido mucho tiempo en montar y desmontar la lámpara más el viaje de devolución. La atención al cliente fue buena a pesar de que me “alertaron” de que si no la devolvía me la cobrarían a mi tarjeta de Amazon. Espero que esta vez entonces me digan que me la regalan por tantas molestias, porque la calidad del producto no parece buena, a pesar de los cientos de buenos review. Debería aclararse en la descripción si necesita un consumo MÍNIMO para que funcione correctamente. Ya me ocurrió con la fuente de alimentación de una lámpara. 5/25/2025El reemplazo volvió fallar después de una semana. Buena atención al cliente, pero el producto muy malo.\n8#It’s works, but barely. Easy to install and works. However as others have said, you need a clear path between the light and the switch. Even trying to instal right next to a window frame 15 feet away did not work, and if you have other LED bulbs on nearby it can also cause interference. However, it does best having an electrician run a new switch for us. This was for a ceiling light that was replacing a ceiling fan with pull cords.\n9#It works great! I ordered this last evening and it arrived early this afternoon. I used it to replace a light switch that became inaccessible. It was an easy install and once paired it works great. Will buy again if the need arises.\n10#Does not work as designed. Installed the switch in our closet to replace a pull chain on the light. It does not work properly. If I hold the switch up next to the light and it works fine but when mounted on the wall about 5 feet from the light it does not work. Tried putting in a new battery but still does not work. Not worth the effort and it's been 35 days so I can't return it.\n11#Work ok. Not sure this is the best one but works most of times. Sometimes its stuck in on position and have to toggle it a few time.\n12#Company has great communication. This product is absolute junk does not work. I have purchased two to replace the one thinking it was faulty none of them work. Absolute trash. Watch the video I posted will answer your should I buy this question *** update *** this seller has great communication they reached out to me with my troubles we tried troubleshooting. Unfortunately things did not work out and they refunded me. The company really went above and beyond to try and resolve my issues. For this reason I've up to my review Stars. It's rare you find a company that cares about the product and tries to resolve issues customers have\n13#Libre de cables visibles. Trabaja perfectamentr como esperado\n14#Reliable. Worked well for my project. It looks like it is wired in. Turns the light on every time. I am satisfied with the reliability.\n15#It requires some skill to install the receiver. Works great.\n16#Not all parts included. Missing the piece that goes in the ceiling attached to the actual light. Only received the wall switch and it’s useless\n17#Good Value Remote Light Switch. Good Value Remote Switch. Installed 2 ceiling LED recessed can-less lights. Too difficult to run a wall switch so went with a wireless remote. Easy install with a simple battery wall mount switch. No real guidance on the remote which I buried under ceiling insulation with the fixtures (IC rated) but no real load. Yes, would recommend\n18#Great value. It was just what I needed to eliminate surface wiring to an existing ceiling fan. The surface wiring had been added to allow the fan to be turned on and off with a wall switch (instead of pulling on the cords hanging from the fan). Installation instructions were easy to follow.\n19#Dissatisfied. Very poor quality. Switch did not work. Cheap plastic, would not buy again Rating should be less than 1\n20#Not functional after several days. Not functional after several days later, and still didn’t work after uninstalling & installing again. Can’t return because limited 1 month returning limitation. New comment: This is a responsible seller. After I sent above comment, they email me sincerely, detailedly describe the installing and testing processes, and replaced me a brand new. I recommend this seller, because they are responsible. Thks\n21#Does not work. does not work. turns off the first time, but does not turn on, to turn on you need to bring the switch as close as possible to the lamp and press the power button about 10 times. the distance between the lamp and the switch is about 5 fit, but it does not work, or rather it only works to turn off.\n22#Turns on, won't turn off. We installed the switch and it turns on fine with the remote, but to turn off the light, you have to be 2 feet from the receiver. Very disappointed. Will have to return it.\n23#Dead on Arrival! I received this about an hour ago. I hooked it up per the instructions. The wall switch turned the receiver on and off as it was supposed to. The only problem, which is a major one, the unit failed to shut off the power. These obviously are not tested before they leave the factory. Very disappointed! Would find another option, like I am going to have to.\n24#Cool beyond words. Perfect solution for lighting my shop when the back service door is used. Huge cost saver.\n25#Operate Lights Without Getting Up. These were an excellent alternative to controlling the hanging lights in our family room! Nobody has to get the go to a light switch!\n26#Just as expected. Just as expected\n27#Easy to install, working very well. Excellent option, easy install, working well with Hampton bay light fixture.\n28#Save money and works well. This such a great use of technology and easy to install. Well worth the money 1/2 price of Home Depot or Lowe’s.\n29#Effective switch, strange design. I love the use of this switch. I have an old home with solid brick walls so running wire was impossible. These switches do the trick! The downside is their strange design. As you can see in the picture, these don't look like normal switches. And, they feel like cheap plastic. This doesn't effect performance, just brings the aesthetic and user experience down considerably.\n30#The price is right. Works as good as more expensive models\n31#Good but might not work. I bought three of them and one of them didn’t work. I installed it and had to switch it out because it didn’t work but other than that, it was pretty cool. I just waited too long to return so now I can’t return the faulty one.\n32#Does not work as 1 of 2 light switches in a hallway. I am unbelievably disappointed in this product. I was under the impression that it would give me an additional switch. However if the main switch for the light is turned on then the button on the receive has to be pressed as well to get the light to turn on. So to turn on a light that this device is attached to you have to press 2 buttons.\n33#light. It worked fine\n34#100%. A great RC light switch, easy to install and use. Good price.\n35#Works well! I purchased this item to control a light in our garage from our house (distance between light and switch is about 30'). The switch works as designed. I wish I had purchased/installed this years ago!\n36#Remote goodness. worked as intended\n37#Worked great for a couple months. Worked great for a couple months. Now it will turn on from the switch, but need to use the button on the wired box to ever get it to turn off. Instantly turns on again. Cheap quality it seems... Bought in August, installed in December. Failed in January.\n38#Disappointed. It works when it wants to.\n39#Troubleshooting. READ THIS TROUBLESHOOTING TIP: If after installing the wireless switch to control a light fixture it turns ON but not OFF or it requires many pushes off etc. AND you are using an LED light bulb, remove the LED bulb and try an incandescent bulb. If it is now reliable and you still want to use an LED purchase a \"dimmable\" bulb. I've had good luck with Phillips bulbs. These are semiconductor switches and there is a technical reason they don't work well with LED bulbs.\n40#Muy practico. Funciona muy bien\n41#Works OK. Works but the off switch isn't the greatest.\n42#Easy Install. If you are unhappy with your existing home \"wall-switch\", this product can be an easy solution for low current loads (such as a 60W light bulb). Install the unit by following the accompanying instructions and then locate the included remote wall switch nearby.\n43#Off Switch Does Not Work. On switch works fine but the off switch doesn't. Sometimes it turns off the lights and most times it does not. I found several other comments by others who encountered the same problem.\n44#It's not very responsive. It's not very responsive, and sometimes pushing the button doesn't work，But so far it's still working\n45#Long lasting use. Easy to install, attractive, works well, been using for well over a year with no problems.\n46#Works great, after some teoubleshooting! I bought this to put in my bathroom. The current lightswitch is behind the door. When I went to install this switch I was baffled, as I discovered mine is a 3 way switch with unknown where the other switch is. I have two hot wires entering the switch. After some Google and YouTube research, I discovered I could bypass the light switch and install at the light fixture. I was going to return the item and claim defeat. But it works and I can now turn on the light without having to go around the door! Go me!\n47#It is not high quality! The remote need to be in horizontal direction towards the switch, slow speed to respond to the remote clicks, if the remote is vertical and mounted to the wall then it gets glitchy and won't function properly. Even the distance between the light fixture is less than 5ft\n48#Range and design issues. Installation was an issue because the learn button can easily get bumped by wires etc. You do need to program remote BEFORE installation. Worse than installation was range. 'ON' seemed to work fine. 'OFF' needed to be within 1' not 100' of receiver.",
