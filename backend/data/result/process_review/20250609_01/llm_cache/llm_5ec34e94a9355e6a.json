Good dimmer\n1#THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK THANKS J\n2#great product - high quality. High quality materials - premium feeling. Easy installation. Works perfectly.\n3#Not Pleased. Bought this one to replace one I had purchase a couple years ago. This one had good reviews and a higher wattage rating so I thought it might work better. At both high and low settings it flickers, not continuously but occasionally. On the middle setting it is less often but overall not pleased. The other rooms in the house with the same LED bulbs do not flicker at all so I know it is not the circuit or bulbs...must be the dimmer. Not another brand for me to try at the moment so I'm stuck. I do not recommend it.\n4#It works. What can you really say about a dimmer switch? This one works fine and blends in well with the other hardware in the room.\n5#Easy 5 mins install. Works great! Replaced my regular switch to dimmer in less than 5 mins. Why spend more when this works as good as expensive brands.\n6#As described and delivered on time. Easy to install and works great with the led lights that we have. No flicker when dimming.\n7#Srcew teminals. My existing junction box is full of wires/nuts with little available space. I wanted to replace the existing switch (which had screw terminals) with same. Now days most switches have wires that you connect to wall wiring with wire nuts and ends up consuming a lot of space in box. This switch was one of few with screw terminals and worked perfectly for me. My only complaint is the switch is a little loosey-goosey (not as solid of a click). But other than that I'm very happy with it.\n8#I own several of these, it's my goto device for dimmers. I have more than one of these (all the bathrooms, foyer, upstairs, living room) and never had an issue with them. I especially like the little led above the switch that shows you were the devices is in the dark. not a big led but in places were you fumble to find the switch, this is would be a nice indicator. performance, never any issues raising/lowering the amount of light from the sockets\n9#Definitely not triac. Gotta send (4) back. Video says it all\n10#Dimmer adjustment not great. Also had flicker in one spot of slider. Easy to install, but ended up having to return it as the dimmer adjustment didn't do a very good job of dimming the lights, even after turning the small adjustment wheel. The adjustment wheel didn't seem to change it much. The switch also had a noticeable flicker at one location on the dimmer slider near the top. The lights were bright at the top of the slider. I tried to use this in a room with 15 Halo 6 LED lights, approx. 14 w each.\n11#Be careful with compatibility. Nice switch, was recommended by another reviewer for the lighted exhaust fan that I had purchased. Unfortunately it is not compatible and hums loudly. Probably not the fault of the switch, just is not appropriate in all applications.\n12#Nice dimmers. Ordered 4 and liked them enough we just ordered 3 more!\n13#does not like certain bulbs. My builder installed a bunch of these, and I found they don't work well with certain bulbs. The recessed LEDs work great, but track lights did not. They were very dim and winked out when my printer was running. My electrician blamed the driver circuits in the no-name LED bulbs I got from Amazon. So I purchased some GE branded bulbs of the same wattage and put one in each circuit. Presto, all the bulbs, including the cheap ones, were bright and steady and the dimming worked perfectly.\n14#Superior quality. Legrand always has quality products, and this one doesn’t disappoint! The amount of led watts this dimmer can handle is what sold me on this product.\n15#Defective. Defective product . Does not operate properly\n16#Exactly what I needed! The dimmer switch was easy to install and works great!\n17#easy to install, 3 faceplate options. Liked that it had three different faceplate options. Installation was easy - BUT my lights flickered at high. I read the instructions and there is a little wheel that you can adjust for the low and high ends of the dimmer. Once I adjusted, it worked great. Very Nice\n18#Easy install, looks great. All my single pole switches are also Legrand, like that it fits with the other switches. Install was a breeze and the dimmer slider works well.\n19#Works great. Simple install. Bought some Vanoopee dimmable LED track lights. Says to use TRiAC dimmer. Was not sure what that was. Turns out many modern ‘universal’ dimmers are usually TRIAC. I took a chance on this one and it worked perfectly right out of the box. Very well made device imo. I just swopped out my SP switch for this one. Worked as hoped. I did follow the directions regarding setting the low end of the dimmer. It was an easy adjustment. Only took two circuit shutoffs to get the full range of dimming of my Vanoopee lights. Very pleased with the product. Very pleased with the 10W Vanoopee 3 color dimmable integral LED track light heads too.\n20#Great dimmer. Nice low profile dimmer. Fits in well with other decora style switches and outlets. Night light is literally just a dot. You'll be able to see it at night, but it's not bright enough to keep you awake if installed in your bedroom.\n21#Flicker free. Great dimmer no flicker\n22#Great dimmer. I was confused about the 3 assorted colors...the package has color \"face plates\" to match your decor. These work with our LCD can lights, and make them a lot nicer in the living room, rather than just the intense full-on lighting.\n23#Works with led. New led lights flickered when using old dimmer. With this one the new leds work great\n24#Works well with LED fixtures and bulbs. I'm an industrial electrician. I installed these in a Media room at work to dim some can lights. Price was certainly reasonable for this type of switch. Dimmers can be touchy about LED lighting. Especially if your having trouble with regular fixtures and LED bulbs. These worked flawlessly. In fact, I want to install a dimmer switch over my Dining Room table. I chose this model for my own house and am expecting it's arrival today. I foresee no issues with this quality product. Be aware that there is an adjustment lever to achieve the perfect 'no flicker' level when installing. Fairly easy install if you follow directions. TURN OFF ALL POWER, and verify no voltage before install! SAFETY FIRST! Live another day to enjoy tomorrow's problems. :)\n25#Bought 3, two worked one did not. Bought 3, two worked one did not\n26#Does not perform. We are completing an extensive home renovation and purchased four of these switches for bathrooms and main living areas. First, do not purchase open box here because those didn’t work at all. Second, the dimmer in the bathroom attached to one sconce with three LED bulbs works well. However, when we used the switch for recessed lighting in the living room (hairy eight 15 watt LEDs) it flickered and buzzed like crazy at all levels of dimming. We switched it out for a Lutron dimmer switch which interestingly is actually rated for lower wattage (150 watt vs the 450 Legrand advertises) and it performed flawlessly. It’ll be Lutron for us from here on out I guess.\n27#Trim adjustment is inconvenient. Works fine but the low end trim adjustment requires removal of the switch plate which is inconvenient\n28#Does Not Work On LED 300 watts. This product is being advertised as working with LEDs up to 450 watts (unlike most other brands which advertise that they work on LEDs only up to 150 watts. This was the reason I bought this. However it does not even work on 300 watts. My lights keep on blinking and there is a buzzing noise coming out of the switch when it's turned on.\n29#Feels good to touch, slider is easy to manipulate! I chose this for my parents in their 60s. Our dimmers have a much smaller dimmer toggle and it can be a pain to manage at 35... This one is just perfect. I am fussy and didn't want something cheap or overwhelming, like an oversize toggle. In our world lights only need a minimal adjustment on occasion. This is the perfect balance. There is one small LED which may not be enjoyed in your bedroom (it is the smallest one I have seen yet however) Overall, this paddle has a crisp actuation and feels quality.\n30#Perfect in every way. This switch looks great, matches other Legrand switches well, and I love the slider for the dimmer. Sure, a slider might look lower tech than a button with a revolving light, but I can quickly set the brightness exactly where I want it without cycling through different levels of brightness. I would estimate the brightness goes from about 30-40% to 100%, so with super bright bulbs it doesn't get that dim, but it's still very noticeably brighter at the high end and comfortably dim at the low end and I could always get dimmer bulbs if I wanted more wiggle room on the dim end. There is zero flickering with led bulbs.\n31#Was not compatable with the bulbs I'm using humming and flikering. Reasonable price easy to install just not compatable\n32#Great Product - Worked Great with LED Undercounted Lights. I literally tripped the breaker, pulled out the old smiths, and installed the new switch. Fit perfect and works like a champ. I installed it to support the three undercounted lights I installed.\n33#Waited too long to return. Purchased in Dec 2021...installed in May 2022...didn't work. Window to return ended in January...oh, well\n34#Flexible. I love how easy it is to change out the color of this switch. When we started the reno, we thought of leaving the switches almond. By the end, everything was upgraded to white and rather than having to buy new switches, I swapped out the plate and went back to enjoying the finished product. Awesome, easy, flexible. Thank you!!\n35#Great product. Subtle pinpoint LED light to illuminate switch location. Elegant design. Fantastic product.\n36#Made in China - NOT USA! This was expensive for a switch. I was willing to pay the higher price because the details listed Country of Origin: USA. The package I received shows Made in China. I am returning it,\n37#Decent Value. Local Home Depot only had as special order item. In stock, only carry 150w max. Had installed LED lighting at 380w. This 450w max did the trick. Get full brightness down to probably about 75w brightness at lowest setting.\n38#Quality product. Works better than the $8 switches. Lights don’t flicker when set on low.\n39#Wish I hadnt. These do work with the my LED ceiling fans, but it causes the ceiling fans to be noisy. I purchased another type on Amazon that said it worked with LED ceiling fans, that one the fan is super quiet but makes the LEDs go wonky, so I purchased these and got the opposite issue.\n40#really like the interface. Replacing older Lutron Ariadnis that cause LED bulbs to flicker. Really like the size of the dimmer slide, and the absence of any flicker.\n41#Junk. Causes flickering with pretty much any LED lights. Installed these for use with brand new Globe Electric Ultra Slim LED recessed lighting and they immediately caused issues with flickering. If you dim both sets of lights they flicker terribly at the lowest setting. Wound up going with Leviton dimmer switches and it solved all my flickering issues.\n42#Easy to install with great wiring options, but doesn't work with LEDs. The look and feel of this is just overall nicer than Lutron's competing decorator dimmer. I really appreciate the matte look and feel - it's less prone to scratching and scuffing and looks a lot nicer than the high gloss options from competitors. Lutron decorator dimmers have wires that protrude from them and require you to use wire nuts to join them with the wiring in your electrical boxes. These, however, have the standard screw terminals that allow for not only the standard J-hook, but also for back-wiring (back, not push-in, which is inferior). The back wiring makes it really easy to quickly and securely replace a lot of switches in a short time frame. The little light on the switch that turns on when the switch is off is also fantastic - it's bright enough to see in the dark, but not bright enough to be an eyesore or call attention to itself. What's the catch? Unfortunately, it seems that this switch has a hard time with LEDs. I tried installing in two different places with different fixtures and bulbs. Despite adjusting the minimum dimming setting on the switch (which is not as easy to adjust as Lutron's), one set of dimmable bulbs would not dim at all. The other barely had any dimmable range and buzzed loudly at all settings. Ripped these out and replaced them with the Lutron switches that had a much better dimming range and didn't cause lights to buzz.\n43#Brand is quality. Hard pressed to find a better dimmer of higher quality with such broadness of compatibilities. Never met an LED or other that didn’t work. Cheaper brands fail with weird LED watt levels or create a flicker on bulbs at the dimmest setting. Nothing more to say but the brand is top tier vs standard builder grade switches. Worth the extra few dollars since switches last so long I cannot imagine how people lived before illuminated switches…. Truly the dark ages\n44#Great Product. Top quality. Very well made. Dims very well. Low to no flickering\n45#Garbage. These are not compatible with LED lights. I purchased 23 of these for my house. Five different types of light fixtures. Each and every one flickers.\n46#Able To Set Minimum Brightness - Nice! Unlike less expensive dimmers, these have a calibration setting to set the minimum brightness of your lights. At minimum setting of the slider, your lights should not be all the way off, that's what the on-off switch is for. The calibration adjustment can prevent lights from going out completely when the dimmer is at minimum setting. That's a very nice feature, in my opinion. The instructions tell you not to make calibration adjustments with the power on. I would heed that advice.\n47#Glitches. Doesn't get as bright a it should. I have 2 small pendants it controls and the original switch was better because it allowed all the brightness that it supposed to show. This dimmer was supposed to give that same brightness option but it just doesn't and it clitches at the highest brightness so we can't even turn it up all the wall. In the picture, the pendants are turned off and the dimmer is not used to take the picture.\n48#No good with LED's. Reading the reviews, the pattern is clear. This switch just doesn't seem to cut it when it comes to dimmable LED bulbs. No matter how many different (dimmable) LED bulbs I installed, I experienced occasional flickering as well as times where I would turn on the switch and the bulbs would dimly light, although the dimmer was turned all the way up. The problem would solve itself by switching the light off, and then back on again. I tried adjusting the wheel on the side to no avail as the problems mentioned above continued. I replaced the switch with the simple GE dimmer and all problems went away. I packaged this one up and sent it back for a refund.",
