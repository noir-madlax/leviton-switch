Works well, easy to install.\n1#Make sure you know your electrical wiring will work. This switch is what I wanted to use for my new fan, but unfortunately I have old wiring that my installer said would not work with this. Bummer I did not want to go into the expense of changing my wiring.\n2#JUNK! I am extremely disappointed with the MACL-LFQ light and fan dimmer/control! I have two in my home with Hunter ceiling fans, and both have the same problem. Yes, it is easy to install, but that's as good as it gets. The light works as expected when used without the fan. The fan works occasionally. Typically, using the fan causes the light and fan to ramp up to high and will not shut off! Following the reset procedure does not cause the fan to stop. The fan just starts back spinning. There is simply no way to stop the fan except to pull the chain! Shutting off the breaker has the same result. Tech support/customer service blames the disfunction on using \"untested\" light bulbs. Unfortunately, \"tested\" light bulbs are impossible to find! Absolute JUNK!\n3#Very good quality for both light and fan. I was getting frustrated with other light/fan combo switches because the knobs would break or fall off. No such problem with this design.\n4#NO WIFI. My bad…I didn’t realize that this product does not have wifi abilities. It’s just a normal dimming switch, built for two devices. For the price, it should have included wifi. Ahhh, the Lutron exclusivity tax. That said, the device works fine as a manual dimming switch (it better for what it cost).\n5#Worked fine for a few months.. Installed correctly. Worked perfectly for months…all of a sudden it doesn’t work. LEDs in front just flicker. Lights and Fan don’t turn on. Very disappointed.\n6#For the price you can do better. I believe this is one of the most expensive switches on the market and you didn’t bother to include a cover. Now, I have to go to local store to buy a piss of plastic that should have been included in the first place. Horrible!\n7#Works great. I have installed two ceiling fans in my house and use this control for both. It works like it's supposed to. Haven't had any issues or complaints. The first was installed about 4 years ago, and I installed the second last month. It has a little dim LED for each control (light, fan) so it can be seen in the dark, but not so bright it'll bother you.\n8#easy to install. the way it look\n9#Works well, but...get the correct bulbs. Lutron has a place in their website that shows approved light bulbs that have been tested and will work with this switch. I've seen reviews where people say the switch didn't work properly after a few weeks or months. I had an issue with flickering green lights on the switch showing an error code. After I bought matching bulbs to install in the ceiling fan that were suggested by Lutron testing, everything has worked perfectly ever since.\n10#Dims Great and Don't Flicker. I bought this to replace my previous switch that used to flicker. These work great. Has a high range of brightness. It was a bit tough screwing the hot wire onto the switch but not a big deal if you're more handy than I am.\n11#Bought 3 in 2022 - two are already broken. I installed 3 of these in my home in late 2022. One starting smoking about 6 months later and shorted out. The second just failed - lights are blinking but nothing works. For the price of these they should last 20 years. I had their old sliding switches for 15 years with no problem - only replaced as they finger slides were plastic and fell off.\n12#Failed after 18 months. Worked great for bathroom fan and LED ceiling lights for 18 months, then failed.\n13#Great fan switch. We have this fan switch in our guest room. It is an easy to use fan switch and allows you to power the fan on and off without changing the fan speed, which is a great feature. The light switch is also a dimmer and it will maintain the same level of brightness. In summary the on and off functions are the rocker switches and the fan speed and dimmer controls are to the side of the on off switch. It’s a really great design and works well/easily.\n14#handy. split my bathroom fan and heat light. nice\n15#Failed after 2 months. Installed by a licensed electrician. Product failed after 2 months.\n16#Works good but expensive. Works well but I can't believe how expensive a single switch is.\n17#A lot of money for poor performance. Don't waste your money. Light pops on randomly when using light, especially in the middle of the night. Hooked up correctly too, must be something inside. Wish it happened when it was still returnable, 2 months in use.\n18#Does not work with all fixtures. I do not know what it does work with, but it did not work with any of my ceiling fans. Does not dim and makes a seriously weird power draining sound.\n19#Lutron Fan Speed & Dimmer Control. Used five (5) of these for various fans in my home. They all work great and a a great upgade to older dimmer/fan control switch. Good product!\n20#Perfect for bathroom! I love this style vs a traditional light switch and the fact that is only a one gang for two functions is perfect. Modern look cannot be beat\n21#Product works as intended. This light switch and fan speed control works perfectly. It has simplified my bedroom area. I like that when the fan or light switch is off the green LEDs are greatly dimmed for nighttime sleeping.\n22#Did not work with my Fan, not sure why but also not intuitive to use, and easy to dislike. Did not work with my Fan, not sure why but also, for me, not intuitive to use and easy to dislike.\n23#Perfect for my Hunter fan. I have a Hunter ceiling fan and this switch is perfect. It remembers the settings, so the light or fan isn’t on full blast when you turn it on and off. The dimmer works perfectly with LED bulbs with no buzz. I recommend the Philips Warm Glow because they replicate old incandescent bulbs so well on dimmers. The speed control for the fan is good. No buzzing at any speed. The slow could be a little slower, but that’s a preference Only down side is installation can be tough. It is much deeper than a regular switch, so make sure the box can handle it.\n24#Product did not work. The product did not work with my new Hunter ceiling fan/light\n25#Funciona muy bien. El control de pared para ventilador y luz funciona muy bien, tiene 4 velocidades, 1 extra para tu ventilador con luz. Hay que tener en cuenta que Lutron siempre envia el dispositivo SIN la tapa externa, hay que comprarla aparte. De resto todo muy bien, por eso no le doy 5 estrellas.\n26#One function at a time. I recently bought and installed this switch and initially it worked fine for the first few days, but now it only works one at a time. Either the fan or the lights. While having the lights on if I turn on the fan, the lights turn off.\n27#Works great. I have a couple now. Will use again, only wish it was a little less money. But with the prices of everything now it’s worth it\n28#Compatibility and/or quality control issues. I bought three of this switch from a big box store. Whether it works as intended seems heavily dependent on the particular ceiling fan you have, even more so than the finicky dimmable LED bulbs. In one fan/LED configuration, the switch works fine and has a neat feature where you can hold down the button and it stays on for a little bit to give you time to exit the room before the light turns off. However, with the two Hunter fans I have, using bulbs recommended by the Lutron compatibility guide, the switches exhibit unstable, maybe even hazardous behavior. In one fan, the bulbs dim as expected… until you turn the fan on, and then the bulbs turn off and can’t be turned back on until the fan is turned off. Even worse, sometimes this causes the fan switch to become unresponsive and it is impossible to turn the fan off without using the little pull tab cutoff at the bottom of the switch. The other Hunter fan is similarly unstable with the same exact bulbs (swapped) with the fan on, except with that switch the bulbs will not dim at all. So it is a problem with the combination of the Lutron switch and the fan. But the fact that there is “crosstalk” between the lights and fan circuits inside the switch makes me very uncomfortable having this hard-wired inside my wall.\n29#As always a great product but no caseta wireless. Why can't Lutheran make a fan and light combo switch that works with cassetta with a smart switch Wi-Fi. I just don't understand it. Again. These work fine if you're not trying to get Wi-Fi, built-in or smart, use the smarts hub from lutron. But in general these are just okay. They just look fancy than any analog switch and they're more modern. But for the price point, they really need to drop this thing by 20 30% to be able to compete with some of the generics out there. I don't think a lot of people would be buying these unless you're in the top 1%.\n30#These are the best. This combo switch is the best switch in my opinion and much easier to install since you do not need to install a reveiver module in the fan housing. They work the best, look the best, install the best, but 4-stars because they are expensive.\n31#Compatibility is an issue. This switch will either work for you or it won’t. It’s a gamble. Years ago, I was a certified electrician, so I’m no dummy on the install of this switch. I hooked it up as instructed, using a brand new hunter ceiling fan and when I pressed the fan button and set the speed to the highest setting, it made a terrible whining noise and the blades barely spun. Pressing the light button, there was an awful several second delay and when the light did come on, it flashed and flickered, randomly going out and sometimes on again. I tried 3 different dimmable LED and all produced the same result. Many reviewers complain of the same issue, so I assume it’s a fan compatibility issue. I’m just not going to waste my time making it work. I’m returning it, but maybe others will have better luck.\n32#Almost impossible to find LEDs that work with this dimmer. It works great with incandescent lights that you can't find anymore, but I bought and returned 3 different sets of LEDs that were on lutrons list as tested and recommended and none if them worked. All the LEDs I tried worked with the dimmer, as long as you did not turn the fan on. If you run the fan and try to turn on the lights, the light come on for less than a second and turn back off.\n33#This switch failed me twice. The first switch I received was totally dead after I wired it in. Returned it and got a replacement which worked perfectly for 3 days, and then out of nowhere it died. Lights dimmed all the way down and neither the fan nor now dimmed lights would turn off. Removed the switch and hardwired the fan and using the pull chains for now and everything is fine. Will look for a different switch to install.\n34#Blown Switches. Installed two of these, one in each of two bedrooms on the same circuit. Two years later in another room a short ocurred on a third device, a recepticle, the only other device on the circuit. After resetting the breaker, I discovered that both switches were destroyed. Tech support informed me that it was a common problem that electricians frequently call about. The switch is more sensitive and reacts faster than a breaker so a short on the circuit will destroy any of these switches installed on it. It was two for two on mine. I'd like to see a more robust design to compensate for known issues like this.\n35#Great switch. Great switch. Very powerful functions in a small package.\n36#Look great and work as they should. Just hope they last because I love them\n37#Works perfect. Install is easy wit the supplied wire nuts and screws.\n38#Add function to your switches. Need to have more switches than we had wall space for. These allow us to control the fan speed and the lights on one switch. They also allow us to dim the lights and fan speed. Just what we needed for the space we had in the wall box.\n39#Great product for dual switches. Great product and easy to install. Highly recommend. Easy to adjust dim settings as well once installed.\n40#Absolute garbage. Switches would not work as shown. Instructions were simple but the product failed. Bad news is that 2 of the three no longer have their packaging so I have to take a loss. Don’t think I’ll be buying this brand again!\n41#Didnt work straight out of the box. Did not connect properly and lights were going haywire. Was really looking forward to using this but failed its purpose.\n42#Nice switch for a fan/light combo. I put this in my daughter's room to control her fan and built in light. It works well for both functions. It doesn't have a remote control option, I was looking for a caseta version of this switch but wasn't able to find it. This works fine for what I need at this time.\n43#Beautiful lightswitch. I needed a switch and fan control combo switch. This switch has a neat and clean appearance. Would buy again in a heart beat.\n44#Fan and light control. Product worked great to control my fan\n45#Bought 7. In 2, when fan is on, lights go out. Cool otherwise. Great features but does no work with all light/ceiling fan units.\n46#More color options. Please add the ivory and light almond!!!!!\n47#Didn’t work for me. Stopped working after a few months. The kit section started flickering all the time. Controls wouldn’t work. Not sure if my electrical connection was the issue or the switch itself. Replaced with same brand but a more traditional style.\n48#Outside deck switch. Works great for our fan/light fixture on the outside deck. Dimmer works great!\n49#Works as described. Use in living room with hunter fan replaced an old switch and the bulbs were flickering. Changed the switch to this one and now no flicker. Great quality. Wish it was smart controlled, but works for what is needed.",
