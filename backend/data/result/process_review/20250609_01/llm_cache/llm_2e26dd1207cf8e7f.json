Both work decent with my led strip lights. Although they don’t dim them at all, they just turn them on…which is fine, that’s all i really cared about i guess but i would be more happy with it if it didn’t take rolling the switch all the way to the end to turn them on, which is not practical at night. Especially since i have to scroll it 3 times around. also doesn’t allow for the controller use and can only choose one color and one setting.\n1#LED dimmer for neon art. This dimmer helps faux “neon” led lighting take the proper place in a room for atmosphere and lighting art!\n2#Worked well. So good so far.\n3#Not recommended. Does it work? Yes. Would I buy this particular one again? No Why? There is literally zero resistance from the turning knob. So, if you bump it by mistake or slightly touch it, it will move and thus change the brightness of lights. Had to tape it with scotch tape to stay in place. Cheap quality and execution.\n4#Quality control is a bit lacking... For my application I only needed the dimmer module, not the cords and enclosure it came with, as I wanted to integrate it into another enclosure. So I took it apart. I am glad I did though, as the connections were pretty bad. The PCB looks decent otherwise, but whoever soldered the USB leads on, did a bad job stripping the wire. It probably would never have a problem as the insides are not likely to shift, but you never know and even a short in 5v is enough for a bad time. I still kept it, but probably would not recommend due to the safety concern. They could easily fix this issue with a little quality control.\n5#Adjustable. Have some extremely bright LED lights. These allow me to dim them when needed. Also gives me the ability to turn on and off without having to disconnect them from power.\n6#Awesome. Works as intended.\n7#Works perfectly with ikea bedside laml. It’s a perfect way to dim an LED bedside IKEA lamp that uses a USB-A charger\n8#surprise it works. I bought this item to dim a neon sign. I didn't think it would work so I am pleasantly surprised that it just works. Love it.\n9#Works fine on all of my USB lighted gadgets. I didnt have high hopes for these, but I was pleasantly surprised since they work well.\n10#A must have. I used them on led neon looking signs. They were extremely bright and now I can adjust from dim to bright.\n11#Perfect for LEGO light kits. I bought these to lower the voltage from a USB power brick to the Lighttailing kits I have for some of my LEGO sets and they worked perfectly for dialing in the brightness level and keeping the lights from getting burnt out. One thing to note is that the description says they use a push button to adjust brightness but it’s actually a physical dial which is exactly what I wanted.\n12#Amazingly better than I ever expected. So many times, USB gadgetry is disappointing. This dimmer has been in use for over 3 years, and it is excellent. It dims a strip of LEDs under the molding on my computer hutch. It allows for cranking the light up to full brightness for reading things on the desk or dimming it to a pale night light. It's the perfect control for what is effectively a backlight for my monitor -- the dimmer stops it from being glaring or blinding.\n13#Very good item. Good quality and useful item\n14#Nice dimmers, no problems in testing. Just received these today, they seem like a quality product. They dim simple USB LED lights like I'd expect them to. Incidentally, these are the same dimmer switches that came on some rodent/lizard heating pads I recently bought, so it seems like a common part. (I say simple USB LEDs because I know they won't work for complex LED drivers that have their own voltage and current regulating circuits and twinkle/dimming IC).\n15#Dimmer. works great\n16#Only one worked. Only one worked unfortunately. Too much trouble to return and wait for another set. Emailed the support on the packaging and have not heard back. Disappointed.\n17#A USB potentiometer with an on/off click! This was the perfect solution to my “Now Spinning” vinyl record holder on my vintage hifi system. The LED lights were way too bright and covering them with translucent tape wasn’t enough. It finally hit me to search for a USB dimmer switch and here we are. These units are lightweight plastic and don’t feel overly sturdy, which is expected at this price point. However, I didn’t expect the “click” that powers on/off so that was a pleasant surprise.\n18#Great for rooftop tent with light strip. Lighting strips are useless without something like this, and it works great. I also connected a three foot USB extension, and ran it to the door, so you don't have to climb into a dark tent feeling around for the light switch.\n19#used to dim led lights that were too bright! these worked perfectly!!! i could not be happier with the results, and the price was great.\n20#This works quite nicely!! We got this to provide a dimmer for an LED night-light. It works very well, smoothly dims the light with no issues.\n21#Perfect fix! I bought two smallish neon style lights off of SHEIN of all places. Didn’t expect much from them, just silly decor for my sons rooms. One is multicolored and VERY bright. The other is white and VERY bright. I wasn’t expecting this from cheap SHEIN lights that are literally each a mere 12” wide, max. I thought, if anything, they’d hardly light up. And then when finding these dimmers I thought for sure they wouldn’t work, even though it’s just a simple USB connection. But nope, they work perfectly! Which is great because I wasn’t sure the white light in the nursery would get used with how bright it turned out to be. Now I can use it for a super cute nightlight or crank it up if we are in there and want some cool white light.\n22#very happy. Does the job very happy\n23#One worked, one didn't... Got these for some usb powered picture lights that are a bit too bright. After making sure they're dimmable LEDs I ordered these dimmers for them. I was really excited when I hooked up the first dimmer and it worked beautifully. I got out the 2nd one and hooked it up, didn't work at all. Tried all sorts of trouble shooting, different power bricks, different lights... very disappointed in quality control and will find an alternative. If they both worked... easy 5 stars.\n24#1 work, 1 DOA. one of these worked as expected, the other did not. Pointless to buy 2 dimming units, and get 1 unit and 1 paperweight.\n25#Awesome. These work great!\n26#Thank You!!!! This worked flawlessly for my small USB neon sign. The sign was way too bright when turned on but this allowed me to bring down the brightness in very small steps until it was perfect for my room. Another reviewer said it didn't work for his neon sign but it's not the product it's the type of sign you have. Some need full power or they shut off. But the well built neon signs will allow power fluctuation which mine apparently does. Thank you for a great product. Would definitely buy again.\n27#Doesn’t work well. I have a small neon usb sign and once I start turning the dial down to dim the light it goes down by barely anything then just shuts off I tried both cables one doesn’t even work at all and the other well like I said dimmed it by barely anything can’t even tell really then just shuts off after a certain point of turning the dial so i don’t know if I got two defective chords considering one doesn’t work at all but not satisfied.\n28#Simple to install, priced right! This is my second time to order these. They work well, simple to install and priced right. What else is there to say?!\n29#Great way to dim TV LED Backlight. I had installed LED backlights on my TV, but they were too bright. I put this inline between USB port and the lights and adjusted the brightness. What a difference! Highly recommended.\n30#Amazing for Small Neon signs. A great product for dimming neon signs. I wanted to be able to conrol the brightness on small neon signs and bought rhis pack hoping it would help. It was the right choice!\n31#Perfect Solution To A Problem! I bought a Luigi statue for my daughter as a night light. Not really it's intended purpose but whatever. Come to find out the light is way too bright! Even for a statue sitting on a shelf the light is ridiculously bright. Bought this dimmer and put it inline with the power supply and now it's perfect! So glad this exists!\n32#Just okay, needs a redesign. Needs a smoothing capacitor as the lowest levels cause flicker with all my LEDs. Also, the taper for the brightness potentiometer is terribe, it feels linear when it should probably be logarithmic. In other words, the lowest settings don't do anything but then, from about 60% onward it gets bright quickly...basically, the range is narrow. Sort of gets the job done...though not that well, wouldn't buy again until they redesign it.\n33#Work great! Ended up ordering two sets of these. Easy to use. Plug them right up to my Jackery or even my smaller portable power banks and do great. I like to dim our string lights lower to enjoy the star's without being in complete darkness. Definitely recommend these dimmers!\n34#I have a USB fan, wanted to slow it down to make it quieter but it didn't work. I have a USB desktop fan, it was still a little noisy even at the lowest speed. I read on another review for a single speed fan to use a LED Dimmer switch to slow it down even further. However, doing so caused the fan to emit a whining noise which was worse than the fan noise.\n35#Does the trick…. Needed to manually turn fairy lights on/off, and to be able to dim and make less/more bright depending on the occasion. Worked well. Would be nice if “smart” feature was available where could be controlled by phone/tablet and/or Alexa/Google.\n36#Billy but got the bill! I used these to dim the LED strips in my tent, and they work just fine. The whole dimmer wheel assembly is really oversized, and that is my only criticism at all. Otherwise I’m very happy with this product!\n37#Control power. I'm not sure how good it is at controlling LED's, but I used it to control power to my USB powered fans and other small items and it worked amazingly also used one and spliced it in directly\n38#These are cool. These are cool\n39#Works, but not with everything. 4 stars, because it does work. Connect it, turn the dial, and your device can go from off to barely on to full power. However -- I got it for an LED lamp that continuously cycles through a range of colors, and it turns out that in order to do that, the power has to be on max. I can have a red glow as dim as I want it, but the color change cycle won't start unless I turn up the power all the way. If I unplug it while on a different color, it comes on red again when I reconnect it, and stays that way unless I turn the power up. I realize this is my lamp's problem, not the dimmer, but since this is probably not an uncommon type of device to want to use this with, you should be warned it may not work for that.\n40#Works Great. Does what it says and clicks to On/Off position. Nice!\n41#Works great! Great for the RV or campsite. Plug into a USB power source in-between the the USB cable and light and you have an adjustable light!\n42#Works well with USB Lights. I used the dimmer switches to connect with VOKARO USB Lights. The lights do tend to warm up a great deal. The dimmer switch helps with that. This is a good purchase for small tasks such as this.\n43#Works as expected. Working great and serving my needs.\n44#Works well. Used to control brightness of two LED lamps for microscope.\n45#not bad. seems to be working just fine\n46#Just as advertised. Works great. Dims a light strip in my Roof top tent. Will also switch it off, so that's super handy.\n47#They work — Perfectly. A little bulky and mugly, but these dimmers work perfectly with 5V strings of faerie lights. And I assume they would work equally well with any low-voltage LED lighting. If you've strung low-voltage LED lights through a tree in your backyard but your neighbor complains that as a result, they can longer sleep at night, dial them back a bit with one of these dimmers.\n48#Works great but very bulky! The dial is very large and bulky. Not a good fit for slim LED light connected to your computer.",
