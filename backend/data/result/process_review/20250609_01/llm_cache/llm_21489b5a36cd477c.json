Works really well for my fans light only downside is it doesn’t sell switches on the side\n1#Great. Perfect, the small size makes it easy to fit into an electrical box.\n2#Very happy. Simple to wire up and works exactly as described, very pleased\n3#Easy to install I hide the remote switch so you can’t see it. Fast shipping easy installation works great I love them\n4#Plug and play. The receiver is kinda large and I had to rearrange some wires in the 3 switch box but it fit without a whole lot of hassle. I did get the two back pieces apart but it wasn't real easy. I think the trick is to put a flat screwdriver in the top end where the slot is and turn it - that will bend one of the pieces and make it so you can release the 4 locking tabs. I then decided to put it back together and use a removable adhesive strip instead of screws into the drywall. It's very light weight. The portable switch is easily removed and replaced from the wall mounted back plate. Works very well.\n5#Works as described! Easy to understand instructions, used on detached garage outdoor lights, remote works well through exterior walls from house 25ft away… remote also works while standing in the driveway 100ft away.\n6#Great solution! Well made! Great solution! Well made!\n7#Works well! This wireless switch works great. I used it in my RV and wired it to an outside flood light and works flawlessly. The receiver is about 50 feet away and works with no issue.\n8#Great purchase! Does what it said. Great invention! We love it. Instructions were great.\n9#it does the job well. it does the job well\n10#Works well. Easy to install. So far works great.\n11#Ceiling Fan. Product works as described. It can operate on the wall or as a switch, which is what we really wanted. Now we can take the remote around the living room to operate our ceiling fan.\n12#Wireless Light Switch Kit. I have decorative patio lanntern lights that are switched on only from a switch located outside on the patio. The installation of this Treewell Wireless Light Switch near a window that looks out onto the patio allowed me to turn on the decorative light sfrom inside. The installation was a bit of a struggle with ethe wiring but it eventually worked. Overall happy with the function of the wireless remote.switch.\n13#Works well, but hard to detach the wall mount from the case. Overall, product works great. I replaced an existing switch that was outside of the room with the \"box\" and it was fairly easy with the help of Internet (my set-up was a bit different than the instructions that do not cover two switches connected in the same electrical box). It worked right away, without the need to pair anything. I turned on the power and it just worked, which was a pleasant surprise. The only issue I'm facing is detaching the wall mount from the switch case. It's stuck together and if I try to use a tool to separate them, I can see the plastic bending. So I can't install the switch on the wall with the provided screws, I might have to use double-sided tape instead, unless the seller can send me both the wall mount and case separated. Let's see if they reply to my comment first. Overall, I like it. I thought about WiFi connected switches but how often do you really use that?...\n14#Good solution for a bad wiring problem at my house. I encountered a strange wiring issue in my house. When the house was built, the bedroom light and the hallway light were wired together, meaning the hallway lights were powered through the bedroom light. To fix this, I removed the wall switch, connected the lights directly to the house wiring , and installed a wireless light switch receiver in the light junction box to control the lights. I installed the housing of the remote switch holder over the light switch JBox, I then added a remote switch in the hallway, allowing me to control each light separately. As shown in the video, the lights turn on instantly with minimal delay. It works perfectly!\n15#Could Not Have Been Easier. The hardest part was installing the battery.\n16#Great for when you need an extra switch. I purchased this specifically for use on a brand new renovated bathroom. I realized that I needed a second switch that was hooked to the exhaust fan and exhaust fan light. So that you could run them independently of the other lights in the bathroom, which all had a night light feature. Without a separate switch this messes up the night light option. So I chose to use this tree well wireless switch, as a way to place the exhaust fan and light on its own switch and circuit. It was super easy to install, however, there are interactions with electricity. So if you don't know what you're doing I would suggest that you get someone to assist you or have an electrician install this for you. The build quality seems pretty good, and the size matched up well with the in-wall switch. Overall the functionality seems to work great, there's very little delay in the process. Recommended for any time that you need to add a switch but you don't have access to running new lines in the walls. I purchased a second one of these so that I could add a antique light to my stairwell that has been updated with smart technology.\n17#Remote switch - It does what it states and is simple to install. Used this remote light switch on a remodel in an old brick home (brick walls with plaster) where it is not easy to reroute or run new wiring. We reversed a door and the light switch was now on the wrong side. This Treewell switch saved a lot of money and time. Removed the old light switch, wired up the controller as per the simple instructions, installed the remote switch and done. No programming, no Wi-Fi needed. If you notice in the video, the old switch box is a shallow metal box. It was tight, but the controller was able to fit and get a cover plate on it nicely. Shut off power to the light switch and was complete in about 25 min, including mounting the remote switch.\n18#Works as Advertised. This allowed us to have a light switch for a new modern light fixture. Our old light fixture had a switch built in the fixture that was hard to use.\n19#Somewhat large to fit in with wiring. These work as advertised but the physical unit that receives the signal from the \"switch\" is somewhat large and depending on the size of the box it is going into and the amount of existing wires in that box this can be a problem. Keep this in mind when selecting.\n20#Best product I've tried. I have tried other wifi switches and this one is by far the best.\n21#Functional with poor design. The switch works. I was able to remote a light from a far to reach area. Installation is not too hard to the electric switch box, but to remove the battery cover from the remote was very difficult as you have to use a pick to pry away the locking tap before you can turn the battery cover. Also, separating the mounting plate from the surface plate is another difficult task.\n22#Works great! More compact than previous wireless switches I've used in the past. Works as expected. Keep in mind you need to use all four wires for this switch. The switch that this one replaced was only switching the hot wires, but I imagine that this needs the neutrals in order to power the unit itself.\n23#Easy to install, has good range. This was easy to install. It works well. I like the small size. That makes it easier to fit in tight electrical boxes. The remote has good range. I like that the remote is removable from the switch plate.\n24#It works but... I ordered this remote switch specifically because it seemed that it would fit a \"decorator\" switch plate. As can be seen in photos, its width is 1.37\" whereas the spec for switchplate opening is 1.31\": a full 1/16\" off. I had to hack away at the plate. I also had to cannibalize a decora switch to get the metal armature to place around the transmitter (see photo). Otherwise functioning is adequate; the transmitter is powered with a button cell.\n25#I couldn’t get it to work. Well, I had high hopes for this device, but unfortunately, I couldn’t get it to work. I typically have no issues installing light switches, but this one vexed me. I installed in place of a switch that turns on a floodlight. Every time I turned on the power it would Immediately trip the circuit (15 amp) and 8 would have to try over and over until I gave up. I even hooked it up in reverse, but unfortunately, my circuit breaker couldn’t handle it.\n26#Easy Install, Easy Pairing, Works Great. This TREEWELL Wireless Light Switch and Receiver Kit was very easy to install, and came with good instructions. This is not the first wireless switch I have installed, and the TREEWELL offers good value. We installed this above a ceiling fan which has constant power, meaning we had to use the chains to turn it off and on. It is really nice to have a switch to be able to turn it on. Paring the switch to the receiver was very easy and it paired within seconds. 5 stars for the easy install, easy to follow instructions, and all around good product!\n27#Wireless switch is easy. It’s attractive, can be installed anywhere, saves running wires in the walls and ceilings and beats having fixtures with pull strings. Easy to install.\n28#Check your wiring first, but very convenient when it works. The thing you need to know before buying this switch remote and receiver is that the receiver requires four wires, which not every light switch box will have. It depends on how your lightswitch was installed. So, I recommend turning off the breaker and opening up the switch you want to move to check the wiring before ordering. Make sure there’s a cable with power coming in (live black wire and neutral white). This will power the receiver. If there are only two wires, then power is going to the fixture first, and the receiver won’t work. There also needs to be a cable with two wires going to the fixture. If there’s a third, red wire, you probably have a 3-way switch. Treewell does sell a receiver with two remotes for this situation (see my review of that below). I installed mine to move a switch for the light over our kitchen sink. The original switch was awkwardly placed behind where we keep our dish soap, etc. I put the new switch on the side of the cabinet above and to the right of the sink. It was great not to have to run wires or take up cabinet space with an electrical box. If you are moving a switch, you might want to go ahead and order a blank wall plate to match your box size and decor. At first, I thought it might feel wasteful to use a battery powered switch, but most ceiling fans have remotes now, so it’s not that unusual. I plan to install a garbage disposal, and I’m thinking about getting another one of these switches for that. Great product! ------------------------------------------------------------ Here's my review of the 3-way version (also 5 stars): Our new house has a Jack and Jill bathroom. The inspector said one of the light switches was too close to the bathtub. I was able to install this receiver where the old switch was and install the new remote switch on the other side of the doorway. The bathroom has pocket doors, so I wouldn’t have been able to move the switch to the new location without this product. I needed the version with 2 remotes because this is a 3-way switch. I couldn’t figure out the wiring to replace only 1 of the switches. So, I replaced them both. I capped off the extra wires going between the two switches (even though there’s no power going to those wires now). There was just enough room in the single-gang box to fit everything back inside. It’s nice that they include both bolts and screws/anchors to install the remote switch plates, allowing you to mount the plates to electrical boxes or the wall. I’m realizing now that I could also move the second switch inside the bathroom. I might do that later. This system is very flexible with lots of applications.\n29#Can put this into normal light switch bank! I was hoping it was possible to pop the switch out of its case and put it into wall plate, I'm pleased to say it works great this way. I basically added a wall plate that have one outlet more than the switches in the box, and was able to have the plate hold that extra outlet in place against the wall, so it looks like a wired switch.\n30#They didn't wire garages very well fifty years ago. We use our garage frequently at night and lights are important as are electrical outlets. They were installed sparingly in this vintage of house. The previous owner added wiring to make the garage more useful. Some of it was installed by a licensed electrician; some wasn't. We have three areas that require good lighting: the washer/dryer, the workbench and the pantry shelves. I'm acquiring remotely controlled switches since getting close to switches in the garage is not easy to do. I'm trying several different types and this one is the first to try. I'm sure it will do the job.\n31#Great for extending a switch. We have a place we visit that has the bathroom light switch on the OUTSIDE of the bathroom. This switch worked perfect for moving control into the bathroom. The only thing to note is that it MUST have a neutral wire available where you mount the controller. If you don't have a neutral in the switch box (we did), you can mount this at the fixture location and disconnect the switch from the circuit by hard wiring the two switch wires\n32#These remote switches are handy when wiring is difficult. These switch relays allow you to put a light switch in a place where wiring is impractical. The light switch was very easy to install. The wireless transmitter has the wiring diagram right on it, so you don't even need the paper instructions, which is really convenient. The box is small enough to wedge in with the wires and has a physical switch right on it which was very helpful. The battery was easy to remove the plastic seal from to use. I'm very happy with the results so far.\n33#Easy and convenient. The TREEWELL Wireless Light Switch kit is super easy to install with no rewiring needed. The remote control works flawlessly with a strong 200FT RF range, making it convenient for controlling lights from a distance. It doesn't interfere with other devices, and the wireless wall switch adds a lot of flexibility to your setup. Perfect for hassle-free lighting control!\n34#Muy práctico y fácil de instalar. Me encantó, y muy práctico.\n35#Buena opción para abanicos con luces led que parpadean. Estaba batallando para poder controlar las luces de un abanico ya que parpadeaban con un smart switch wifi pero con esta solución en conjunto con un bond bridge que ya tenía pude solventarlo y la luz ya no parpadea y puedo controlar el interruptor de encendido de manera remota.",
