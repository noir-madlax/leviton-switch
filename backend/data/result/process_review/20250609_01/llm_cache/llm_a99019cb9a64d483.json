How could it be this easy... I spent way too much money on a new patio. And then at night when I flipped on my outdoor floodlights you would think I was on a nighttime airstrip. Too bright for comfort when lounging on the patio. Ahhh... I need a dimmer that I can control with my phone I said to myself. So I ordered the FEIT dimmer as can be controlled by their phone AP. or at the actual new FEIT switch. Easy install of the switch. Easy download of the phone AP. It works ! Two tips for users: Tip 1) With my first attempt to dim either at the switch or with the phone AP half of my 6 LED Floodlights flickered like crazy. I checked the bulbs and they were stamped \"dimmable\" I was suspicious though and ordered new LED FEIT (brand) floodlight bulbs. Everything works great now. Tip 2) The phone AP dims the lights with a slide bar that moves up and down. Slide down and the lights dim. Up they brighten. I had it in my head that when I fully dimmed the lights the lights would go out. Wrong. On that same phone AP slide bar image is a blue button that turns the lights on or off with a push of the button At this stage I'm trying to find more uses for this great switch.\n1#Works great. Love these. You can control all of your lights with your phone. Also you can have them turn on or off automatically to eliminate timers.\n2#Not Dim enough. The switches work great using the App or Alexa to control them, but they don't dim the lights enough. On lowest setting the lights are still too bright.\n3#It’s a switch. Compatible with Alexa and easy to set up\n4#Was able to create a 4 way install with this. Was able to complete a 4 way install with this switch pack. Basically the same way as a 3 way, the red wire in your home often the traveler is sent between the dimmers as a signal wire. So 2 of the switches are dummy \"remotes\" that tell the third switch to actually do the controlling. The Third switch in the setup has the actual load in this configuration. The manual doesn't describe how to do this but the middle switch has 2 red travelers on one side of the switch 2 black wires on the other side (hot) and of course the neutral wire. I've had these switches for years from Costco and they never gave me an issue. They're not the prettiest but they are specifically cool due to the signal wire used.\n5#Smart dimmer. Dimming is good\n6#Maybe 4.5 stars. These are almost perfect. Sometimes a little hard to install, sometimes tricky to connect to WiFi, sometimes challenging to program but overall a solid WiFi light switch that works for either single pole or 3-way and connects easily to Alexa and Google. Now if we can only get to a place where everything is plug and play I will be happy to never have to troubleshoot again.\n7#WiFi dimmable light switch. Absolutely love these. They work with \"Hey Google\" The low level is adjustable and I really like that I can turn the lights off from anywhere since my family leaves the lights on.\n8#Won’t power on switch. Despite having required neutral wire, switches didn’t work, wouldn’t power on. Very little help from tech support, returned them. Still looking for alternatives\n9#great. Fast, correct.\n10#Talk to me. I absolutely love these. All you have to do is speak an action, and it happens. Everything from turn on and off, to asking what degree of brightness.\n11#Perfect. App can be glitchy at times but it’s perfect other than that!\n12#Way better than the others. Have used a bunch of different switches in my home Tuya, Smartlife - these are far more reliable...so far. Most of the others failed within a year.\n13#Great product!! Looks good and it works!! Highly recommend!\n14#Best smart dimmer. I was an early adopter in the smart switch space and have probably installed upwards of 40 smart switches in my home since 2015. Starting with the Z-wave/Zigbee/Smartthings mess to the much better wifi versions that everyone uses now. These are the best I have used. No wires coming out of the back and they aren't too deep, so they fit in your box. They also have dedicated dimming functions and LEDs showing how bright the dimmer is set. Easy to connect to wifi. These are the best smart switches in have used. If I was going to design the perfect smart switch, I would use this back side design with the treatlife dimmer front. (The back side of the treatlife is huge and often won't fit in the box with the wires.)\n15#Great Product! I have been using FEIT products for a few years now. No issues. Good, cost effective solutions.\n16#Highly Recommeded. This product is highly recommended for anyone considering installation. It is straightforward to install, and once set up, it can be easily integrated with Google Home. Overall, it is an excellent choice for those looking for a reliable smart home solution.\n17#Excellent. Chère, mais ils sont merveilleux\n18#Muy elegantes y bonitos. Solo que si tú casa no tiene corriente neutra no te van a servir .",
