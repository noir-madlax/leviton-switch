When you set the appropriate diming for the lights and turn off; when you turn back on it goes to full brightness, not where you set it to. Each time you turn on the lights you have to go to the switch and reset to the appropriate dimness again which is ridiculous for an expensive control.\n1#Not \"new\" as described. Received damaged/used product. Purchase was supposed to be \"new\" product. Product works fine, did not opt for return/replacement as in a time crunch. Disappointed in seller/amazon for trying to pass off used product as new.\n2#Good price for the package. This package is a decent deal if you need two Casetas with the bridge. As always, these devices just work and have very good/durable build quality.\n3#I am keeping the Order-Lutron Caseta Original Smart Dimmer Switch Kit ! I am keeping the Order and I am not returning the order ! Lutron Caseta Original Smart Dimmer Switch Kit, 2 Dimmer Switches, 2 Wall Plates, 2 Pico Remotes, and Smart Hub, Works w/ Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, 3 Way, 150W, No Neutral, P-BDG-PKG2W-A\n4#A ‚ÄúMust Have‚Äù! This is a very important purchase when wanting to have the full scope and functionality of these dimmers. The hub is the key to coordinating all of them together, and to be able to connect them to smart phones and Alexa.\n5#Works üíØ of the time. I went down the road of buying the cheaper switches and bulbs before‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not worth having to reset things every few weeks. But once cry once. Syncing with google was a breeze. Install was also very smooth:\n6#Did not work for me. love the idea of this, however the switches I received only have 2 wires and all the instructions show them with 4 wires. I have not been able to install it as it will not work with my existing switch as it is a 3 way configuration. I have reached out to Lutron for support but have yet to hear back.\n7#Amazing switches. The Lutron Caseta kit and the switches the I bought are very easy to use. The dimmer function works well. The programable timer switch is pretty handy. Using different lights to come on and go off at different times when away is a good feature to use when one is away from home. I have done away with my portable switch timers. You can manipulate the lights using the app on the cellphone also.\n8#Don‚Äôt burn your house. If you are not an electrician always check the amp of the switch if the amp of the switch is less than 15amp is not worthless buy it. Cause this one is only good for 2 lamps or bulbs. Don‚Äôt burn you house. I hope this is helpful\n9#As described. Great product.\n10#Good Solution with Caveats. The system works well. Unfortunately, the kit is frustratingly incomplete, and the instructions are flawed. This kit contains a Pico remote, which, in most cases, will replace a switch in a separate location as part of a 3-way installation. However, the kit lacks a bracket required to mount the included Pico remote where the other switch was removed. It's not something found in any local hardware store in my town. It very frustrating to finish installation to discover that all the parts needed were not included. You need the Lutron Caseta Smart Lighting Wall Plate Bracket for the Pico Smart Remote, Directly Mount Pico Remote To The Wall, 3-Way (No Wires Required), PICO-WBX-ADAPT a simple plastic part for a ridiculous $7.34. OK, the instruction are oversimplified to the point of being questionable. The instructions describe removing the old switch to replace it with the new Caseta switch and using included (cheap) wire nuts to attach the old wires to the new wires from the Caseta. As described, that's an unsafe practice. The old wires should have the bent ends removed and then have 1/2\" stripped off before using wire nuts or any other connector. They also need to describe the proper technique of using wire nuts. I suggest using 3M Performance Plus Wire Connectors, or better yet, if you're unfamiliar with how to best use wire nuts, consider something like the Ideal Electric Lever connectors.\n11#Caseta for the Win! I love how modular and convenient Lutron Caseta is to use and install. I now work in the smart home industry and we install these everywhere. Integrates with every major control system as well as HomeKit, Alexa, etc.\n12#Flawless. Works perfectly with google assistant. Only downfall is I‚Äôd like them to turn on in the dimmest mode possible. I will be suggesting these for all clients.\n13#Dimming. Lutron is the dimming leader!!! Easy to use.\n14#Doesn't play well with Harmony Hub. Couldn't add commands to control through Harmony app.\n15#Best product on the market! I installed and used so many of them in multiple houses and every time I am in owe! They are great!\n16#Great deal and worth the price. There are less expensive smart dimming solutions. But none of them are superior to this. You can use the wall switch, the remote, Alexa, or the app. Doesn't interfere with your wifi. Easy to set up. It just works really really well. You wont be disappointed\n17#Works perfectly for my lights. Since I don‚Äôt have a 4th wire (Neutral), I decided to acquire this switch. Impressed my family and visitors that I can dim the lights in the living room and the video room (for movie nights).\n18#Easy install - no common wire needed. I have an old house with no common wire - these switches install easy - even if you have no electrical experience. Watch a youtube tutorial if needed, turn the breaker off, and then swap out the switch in about 5 minutes. The hub connected to my router super quickly and it was easily the quickest and easiest smart home app set up that I have ever seen. Definitely worth the price! I will be buying more and I love that they all connect to the hub so easily.\n19#Nice system. Anything electrical can be a challenge. One of the 2 switches I was replacing was a 3-way. It took a while to sort that out. YouTube was helpful. The other switch was a single pole, so that was a snap to replace. OnceI had these installed they worked well.\n20#Regret buying this. I had Zwave in my previous home. Worked great with Hubitat. Bought a new home and it came with a couple Caseta switches. Overall they work fine. The hub is easy and the switches are easy to connect. What I hate about these switches are the 4 buttons. Good luck hitting the right one at night. Top one goes full bright and does NOT remember last dim level like a Zwave switch. There is no way to program this. You must hit the middle dim button and hold to the level you want. Zwave was one tap and done. After searching for this problem people have been complaining of it for 5 years. Only the switch with the middle round button can be programmed with pre set dim. FYI: It's $120. Lutron, you screwed up.\n21#The one to get. This is way more expensive than other smart switch kits or standalone switches, but it‚Äôs the most compatible‚ÄîGoogle, Alexa, and HomeKit to name a few. Plus with the hub, I don‚Äôt have to expose the switches to WiFi which is one of the primary reasons why I purchased Lutron. And it works quite fast, lights turn on/off instantly whether at home or remotely and it behaves nicely with my HomeKit setup. Overall I‚Äôm quite happy\n22#3 year review. In 2020 I lived in an older house with no neutral wires. I wanted to upgraded the lights in the living room and kitchen to smart lights, but most of the available options were expensive smart bulbs or systems that only work with neutral wires. Like everything else I purchase, I do TONS of research first. I eventually found this system and it matched my needs exactly. I purchased this kit plus a single additional dimmer to use in a 3-way switch setup. It was very easy to install, even for the 3-way switch. The included plate covers hide the screw holes giving it a more modern and clean look. It even comes with a remote. After installing the hub and switches I downloaded and installed the free mobile app. With the app you have complete control of every switch individually, thanks to the tiny hub that ties them all together using its own wireless network. The hub plugs into your wireless router so you can control your switches from anywhere over the internet. You can also create scenes and schedules to control them separately or together in groups for different scenarios. For example, sometimes I wanted to turn off the kitchen and living rooms at the same time with a single action, or turn on/off the kitchen without affecting the living room. That same year we were gifted a Google home mini. After getting that setup I was able to easily integrate the Lutron system with it. I could now says \"Hey Google, turn off all lights\", or \"set living room lights to 30 percent\". It really was a game changer not having to jump up and run across the room just to adjust the lighting. It may sound like the next step in laziness, but I saw it as the next step in productivity, as I work from home and having to stop working for a simply task was a distraction I was happy to no longer be burdened with. Other times you just want to raise the lights to find something or to clean up a spill quickly or turn the lights off for a quick nap without having to move at all. We moved into a newer home in early 2022. After my previous experience with the Lutron products I installed the existing system in the new home and expanded it, making nearly all of the switches smart Lutron switches. I even have smart outlets outside over 100 feet away from the hub to turn on and off exterior lighting as the sun rises and sets. Adding new switches and outlets is a breeze. You just install them, select them in the mobile app and push a button to pair them to the hub. I have seen a lot of newcomers to the smart switch arena in the past three years, but most still have the same limitations as in the past, such the the neutral wire requirement. Even my newer home has some switches that lack neutral wires, so Lutron is still the best option. Lutron does of course also offer many switches that do work with neutral wires, such as where you only want on/off switching without the need to dim. For those switches you do wish to use as a dimmer, make sure the bulbs you use are compatible. Incandescent as dimmable. Most newer LED bulbs are NOT dimmable, so be sure to read the box to make sure they will work with your switch. This has been a solid and outstanding system with zero issues that I have used to run my homes for the past three years. Anyone with light switches will love this system as much as I have.\n23#Simple Smart House Upgrade. Installation was as easy as a standard light switch. Integrates perfectly with Google Home. I've always heard Lutron was the best for smart switches and after a few months, I haven't experienced any issues. Looking forward to getting more in the future.\n24#This system is amazing. I have a house built in 1968 with a lot of switched receptacles. My wife and I went with Caseta as they had wireless lamp dimmers, and let me tell you - this system can do a lot! We removed all the receptacle switches and tied the wires in the box together. The. Put the pico in that spot. Now, I have the ability to control individual lamps thanks to the programming. We now have Caseta throughout the whole house, garage, and outside lights. I will recommend this product to anyone who had an older house but wants a light system. 5 stars!!!!\n25#Great feature app. Setting up schedules easy.\n26#I wish this wasn‚Äôt so expensive. The caseta dimmer setup is by far the best option out there. They are just way overpriced for what you get. They are very easy to install however most newer homes have common wires available when replacing plugs so that opens up a wide array of alternative smart dimmer options for a fraction of the price. Given I use Alexa for most of my dimmer switch needs, I cannot tell the difference between an inexpensive smart dimmer and these dimmer switches.\n27#Ridiculously Misleading. What is this dumpster fire of a product listing? These switches are not 3 way. They just let you mount the remote control to a wall and pretend it's 3 way, so you can't actually replace 3 way switches with it. The max wattage is listed as three different values in three different places. The \"Deluxe* version is the exact same thing, but with an extra light switch. Why is there no picture of the back or a wiring diagram anywhere in the product info? For the world's longest product description, it contains almost nothing useful. The marketing nonsense in here is insane.\n28#A great alternative to rewiring. I have many of these. My house isn't huge, but now I can have switches anywhere without having to run wires everywhere.\n29#Top Notch Smart Dimmer Switch. Lutron Caseta line of switches are excellent. Easy to follow video installation instructions. Dimmer switch works great. Completely happy with the purchase.\n30#Wrong item keeps coming. I have ordered this item twice and the Lutron store keeps sending me the wrong item! Once I can understand but twice? Get your act together.\n31#Best in the market. Lutron is the best. What can I say. Set it and forget it\n32#Excellent! The Caseta switches were easy to install and have worked as designed. Allows integration into Apple Homekit. Hub was quick to connect to my network and range was excellent\n33#A worthwhile investment. I really wanted these switches for my living room light and foyer light during my irrational \"nesting phase\" of pregnancy and I'm so glad they worked out like I thought they did! Smart switches turned out to be a better fit for us because they don't die like smart bulbs so you shouldn't have to replace them, and they still turn on with voice control or scheduled routines even if the switch accidentally gets flipped down. For installation, definitely read the instructions and follow the video. My husband and father in law tried to wing it and it took them a few hours to figure out until they followed the instructions and then it was much smoother going. Also, we incorrectly assumed that if we didn't have dimmable bulbs then that feature just wouldn't work and the switches would be limited to just on and off. We were wrong; you must have dimmable bulbs for these to work properly. With regular bulbs, they were stuck at about 25% brightness. Once we changed the bulbs, everything worked as it should. Now it is GREAT to have our lights turn on in the morning so we can see as we pack our baby up for daycare and great to have the lights on when we get home in the evenings. I set these 2 routines up with Alexa, but the Lutron app seems like it could schedule this easily as well. Being able to tell Alexa to dim, brighten, turn on/off the lights when your hands are full with a baby is a God send and I truly think this is something that should be on the radar of more parents to be. I can already see upgrading bedroom and hall and bathroom lights on for when my baby is older so everything turns on to get her up at put of bed in the morning and yet I never have to worry about lights accidentally being left on all day. I also love how the look of these has modernized the look of my 90s home.\n34#Excellent Product. The switch installed quick and easy, no neutral needed. The smart bridge installed quickly and easily. The Lutron app is extremely user friendly. The remote switch installed easily. It was also very easy to connect the device to my Alexa. I am extremely pleased with this product.\n35#Pico Remotes not Homekit compatible. Advertised as completely Homekit compatible, but the included Pico Remotes aren't pairable at all, only the wall switches themselves. Really disappointing, as I wanted to use one of the remotes to turn off a non-switched overhead light but cannot. I'd call this a bit deceptive.\n36#So nice to tell Google and Alexa to turn on and off fan and light from bed. Can't speak to ease of installation, as I had an electrician do it, but they work great! Three fan speeds, and you can voice activate them. Seven levels of light brightness creates the perfect mood lighting, and nice flat, sleek modern look.\n37#Easy Install. My home wiring wasn't made for the newer devices so these really help me integrate my home. These switches and controllers need a hub to operate (Wish they could find a way to integrate with the echo directly).\n38#Rip-off. Cheaper if bought individually. Just make two separate purchases: 1) a dimmer + pico and 2) dimmer + pico + hub. Will save you about $30.\n39#Fast and reliable. These are fast and reliable switches, easy integration with Home Assistant. No neutral wire needed\n40#Nice upgrade, work great, easy install and more tech savvy than we are. I took a chance on these for a new build, and so far I'm loving them. Haven't tried the WiFi / Alexa etc features yet, but I have confidence it'll work as advertised. Contacted Lutron about a random question, a real person with actual understanding of their products answered my question in less than 2 minutes!\n41#best so far. These are the best smart home switches I have ever used, and I've been into it since the early 2000's. These are responsive and reliable. The only missing feature is dim level memory or a way to set a default dim level. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that they can operate without a neutral since one of my switches is a switch loop.\n42#Absolutely LOVE Lutron Caseta. I have over 30 Lutron Caseta items now... mainly lightswitches/dimmers. I hooked up some Lutron Serena Shades as well. I can't speak highly enough about the brand. I have had ZERO issues with their products. Bullet-proof connection, consistent performance, and a great app with great features like scheduling, random away modes, etc.\n43#PERFECT! Ive been on a mission replacing all my current switches at home with Lutron Caseta Smart Switches and I made the start with this set as it came with the hub and have since grown my project to 18 Caseta switches and counting. I love the brand and the reliability it offers. I haven't had any issues since I've started using the system months ago. I have purchased all the face plates from the Lutron Claro line to complete the look. They are a bit pricey so I purchase them piece by piece. Im almost complete and so happy I chose Lutron.\n44#Premium smart home light controller. These are a great solution for your smart home lighting needs. I started my smart home journey with a lutron dimmer and fan control. I now have the hub and several other switches. They are a bit more pricier than others but they are a high quality product. When paired with a solid network, there‚Äôs almost no lag when using the lutron app, pico remotes, and Alexa voice to control the lights. I‚Äôve never had a device disconnect. The install was a breeze. The dimmers and fan control were easier than a normal switch install! The instructions are clear and straightforward. Highly recommend\n45#Works well. Very good starter pack. It was easy to install. Works well with Google assistant. Pairing with the pico remote is not straight forward. I had search the web for assistance.\n46#Nice modern addition. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because it ONLY comes in white. We would have loved off white to match our paint. I even wrote the company and they told me the sets only come in white. You can buy some individual components in off white but buying individually, the price triples!! It's handy to be able to turn your lights on, off or adjust the brightness with your phone also.\n47#Good looking and super convenient! Good-looking switches! I know, sounds weird but they do look amazing. They were easy to install. Also, the hub and mobile app were easy to set up. The included instructions were pretty clear and straightforward. Finally, the pico remotes are super convenient, especially for the dining table, hehehe.\n48#Easy way to add smart lighting and fam control to your home. If you know what you are doing with electrical wiring you can easily install these switches. The app setup for the bridge is pretty simple. Once you connect to HomeKit, you can set automations and scenes easily as well. I‚Äôve got a contact sensor in my pantry and a Lutron switch for the light setup so the pantry light will come on when the door is opened and goes off when the door is closed. Can‚Äôt wait to add more switches.\n49#Works well. Got two switches to start out, both with remotes. Some how one remote paired with two switches. Not a big deal. I tried using the second light switch to control my ceiling fan, but the fan made a weird noise. I'll find another use for the switch, likely adding more in the future.",
