Easy to install, bulk 3-way switch.\n1#3 way switches. Swapped out some switches with these 3-way switches. There’s no doubt you’ve flipped the switch with these. The throw is very stiff. User preference tho I guess. Would buy again.\n2#No complaints so far. Been used for a while and no complaints\n3#Too much pressure/effort required to flip these switches. The amount of pressure required to 'flip' the switch is excessive. If it takes 4 oz. of pressure to flip a normal \"silent\" light switch - these take about 2 lbs. This is a subjective description but it is very different from any modern era silent switch I've seen. The effort required is more in keeping with the switches of 40 years ago that made a pronounced \"click\" when you toggled them (maybe even more). I am one day over the return period or I would return them all. As is I am stuck with 10 switches that I will not use. If you don't care how much effort required to flip it, they are probably okay.\n4#Well made switch. The switches are heavy duty and made to last.\n5#Worked for both sides. Was perfect for my Airbnb remodel and was much cheaper then from the physical store.\n6#Well made and great brand. I have been using these three ways throughout my 1937 farmhouse you walk through multiple rooms to get to the next and I wanted to be able to turn on lights as you go. I have also used them for single pole switches as well and they work great. Before I install them I showed them to my electrician to get his opinion and he thought they were well made as well. Much more affordable than anything I could find in a big box store.\n7#Great Price. Better priced than local stores! Work great!\n8#Works great! Changing the switches in my house from old to new. And no complaints\n9#Well made was expecting inferior product for the price. Well made, but the wire insert ports are too small, need to use screw posts\n10#Easy install. Good price and easy install.\n11#Works great. Great quality,performance easy installation and look good.\n12#Good. Good product\n13#Works as advertised. Just as advertised\n14#Great product. That work perfectly, I replaced my three way switches last week. And no problem with it. Thank you\n15#Like new. This house was built in the late seventies and all the switches felt kinda gummy and not making the best contact. They look and feel like new now!\n16#Good value for quiet switches. Inexpensive and seems to be of fair quality for 15A switches.\n17#they work like they are suppose to. They are light switches. If you don't know how to install them hire an electrician\n18#Good switches. Bought during Covid shortage, big box store out of stock. Usually use Leviton switches, but these were close to same quality.\n19#Read before buying. I installed three way and breaker kept tripping. I assumed was my issue but tried another switch from box of 10. Same problem. Went to home depot got a Leviton. Wired same way. No issues. Would not buy\n20#Easy to install. Easy to install and work well\n21#It's a switch. Good quality.\n22#LOUD action. Nice switches, but the action LOUD. Like, snap your fingers loud. Returned them immediately\n23#Very stiff. These work and look nice but the toggle is pretty stiff compared to other switches.\n24#Got the job done! We are replacing some the switches in our house to white. These got the job done but you do need to use a little more force to flip the switches on and off. Nothing you won’t get use to but you can definitely tell a difference from these and switches in other rooms.\n25#I dont have a title. I dont have a review\n26#Exelente calidad. Fácil de instalar\n27#Good Value. Good value for quality component.\n28#Best for immediate replacement. I wish to tell my best about the fast delivery, this is quiet disturbing i have to work during week to have my project finish and already have the parts ! :) As you know now, i am electrician, There is some yearly regulation broadcast to our members. First one tab of the screw mounting of the switch have a copper plate, this very important, it needs to be on the life circuit, we don't show instructions about that. Second, the ON/OFF imcription we can't see it easily, i know when you have to flip a switch you just try, but why you print a ON/OFF releif even though we can't see it, this is why i downgrade 1 star. Rest is perfect, nice product and will consider for reference !\n29#Want to turn on a light as you enter a room that has 2 doors, this is the answer. I have the need to turn on the lights, going from up stairs or down the stairs. Or entering the kitchen from the back door, or from the livingroom. This is a great way to do it your self. The information on how to hook up a 3 way switch is on the internet. You just need no less than 14 Gage 4 wires, with Black, Red, White and a Ground bare wire. 2 outlet boxes and 2 3 way switch.\n30#Great. As expected. Good value.\n31#Not a quiet switch. They are not quiet switches, I had no idea that loud clicking switches were even manufactured these days.\n32#Good value for the money. Had to go this route since all the hardware stores nearby were out of ten packs of three ways. Little thicker plastic around the switch which was a surprise but still managed to make them look good. They do have require a little more effort to flip then the Eaton switches I'm used to, but should loosen up as time goes I would assume. Overall good value and solid switches.\n33#Great product at a great value! This product met my needs!\n34#Good value. Updating wiring throughout house. Added a lot of smart switches, motion sensors...yet required some 3 way switches. They feel \"substantial\".\n35#simple cost efficient home updates. apparently everyone use to like beige, because its everywhere in older homes. all of our outlets and switches got replaced in our remodel. super easy to change out, just follow wiring already there, turn off power unless you like getting shocked or tripping breakers you will need plates for these, depending on the gang size you have\n36#Great Buy for the money. Easy to Install REmolding a House\n37#3-way switch. Appears to be well made, haven’t installed them yet waiting on materials, made and look like Leviton\n38#Was what I was expected. Was as described\n39#Fantastic! Great product!\n40#Noisy Switches. The switches seem to work fine. But they make a loud click when switching them on/off.",
