I bought a 3-pack of dimmer switches for about half of what I've paid in the past at the big box, for use with LED lights. I was skeptical, because of the price, but they look great and work every bit as good as anything I've installed.\n1#Light flickers. Don't waste your money buying this. Loke others have said, 2 out of the 3 makes weird nose and flickers. Spend a little more and get the Lutron Diva dimmers.\n2#Don't hesitate!! They work great! Even my electrician liked them!\n3#Clean, modern look. Used these to update a 40-year-old house. Along with new paint, they really spruced up the look!\n4#Save Your Money. We were initially pleased when we had these three switches installed by an electrician during a remodel. They worked well and looked great. But starting on day two a different switch broke down on each of the next three days, loosing their clicks and requiring multiple attempts to actually turn the lights on. After about a week, the dimmers all failed as well. All three switches had died within a week! These things *can* happen sometimes, and they say they will replace them. However, they do not respond to customer service e-mail, and the phone number eventually goes to some guy's voicemail with a promise to return your call. After a month of no response, I just cut my losses and ordered Lutrons, which I installed all together in about 30 minutes. From the beginning, they have worked far better as dimmers and they turn the light on every time. I hope that my learning this lesson about Bestten means that you don't have to.\n5#2 of 3 died in 2 month. Installed all 3. First one started making the light flash like a strobe light; put in a different switch and it works fine now. Second one just stopped turning the light on. Too late to return üò°\n6#Love it. Great price\n7#The color is off. I bought to go with white wall plates and these are not a true white. They look almost gray compared to the wall plate. If you are looking for a true white switch these are probably not what you want.\n8#Works fine. Works fine for a dimmable switch.\n9#Great dimmers! The 3 pack was exactly what I needed. I bought this brand of switches for a full condo reno and they work great. I did end up using standard cover plates instead of the super modern looking ones that come with this dimmer but other than that it all worked out perfectly. No need to spend more money on other brands. These are the switches to use.\n10#Only 2 out of 3 worked. Had professional installation done and 1 of the 3 ordered was faulty. Was not able to find how I could get a replacement or refund.\n11#Broke after not much use - second one that broke. Switch just failed and popped out of the casing. It also cracked. Up to this point, they seemed okay. Changed out the entire house. Now I need to consider replacing all of these with another brand. Be aware. Second one broke. The pin that holds the paddle. See pic. Third one broke. The pins on the paddle don‚Äôt hold up and snap off. Bummed.\n12#Full width rocker switch because of a bottom slide dimmer. Everything was in the box!\n13#Great product. Bought several for the new house. Thanks\n14#Some good some bad. felt like I got someone retuned item. Dimmer on low not so great\n15#Chinese products are good and cheap. What a deal! I feel sorry for domestic brands.\n16#There very affordable n they work great. I used this product at my house n they work good üëç\n17#Very nice. Cost was great for 3 switches. Didn't sit flushed to the wall like I hope for but works well. Not for sure if it's the age of my house.\n18#You get what you pay for. Dimmer function did not work with LED can lights.\n19#Great product, good price. Worked as anticipated. Great product.\n20#Clear instructions and easy to install. No issues whatsoever with the switches. It installed easily and the two red wires were labeled as to which one to use for 3-way or one way. The looks are great and the dimmer range is very good. I would recommend this brand without hesitation. The only thing I would encourage is the use of a full-depth electric box and not a shallow one.\n21#Get these. Love these!\n22#Excellent product üëç. Cool and excellent product üëç\n23#breaks after a year. the switches keep breaking after about 1 year, something small inside seems to break so it does not turn on the lights anymore.\n24#Pure and utter garbage - DONT BUY. A penny saved is a dollar spent. These do not work as advertised and are not worth the time to install. They do not maintain settings and require constant adjustment to stay in range. Save your money and buy anything but these\n25#Definitely used product. I don't recall buying/paying for used product...\n26#Totally Disappointed now. Update: Now these rate as a 1 Star. Besides the issues we previously mentioned, now two of them have failed completely. Internal switch mechanism broke and these are not in a high usage location. Absolute cheap China garbage! Dimmers on these are very poor. Tried on several different LED lights. Almost full bright or gill dim. Getting anything subtle in-between is impossible and tried various adjustments with the internal dimming thumb wheel. Sliders just don‚Äôt have very good dimming range. Would have returned these but were the only ones that closely matched existing dimmers in our home.\n27#Seller backs up the product. We received a faulty switch in our pack (2 worked, 1 didn't) and the seller was quick to send a replacement. Switches are great otherwise.\n28#Product works well as advertised. Good value for money. Product works well as advertised. Good value for money.\n29#works well. does not dim low enough.. 1was installed in bathroom. however i'm very satisfied.\n30#2/3 switches broke after 3 months of light use. Switches are very low quality. 2/3 of 3 broke within 3 months of installation. They're easy enough to install, just do not last long at all. Wouldn't recommend.\n31#Look great. Goes with our decor. Look great\n32#ability to dim led pot lights. did not work for what they were intended for\n33#Flickers badly with LED dimmable recessed lights. With LED recessed dimmable downlights these flicker really bad. Any amount of adjusting of the sensitivity dial doesn't correct it. And with multi-gang installation, braking off the extra aluminium sides takes too much effort! I've done the same on other switches many times, and a few wiggles would break these off easily. Not with this product! I had to struggle and bend the whole box for 5 min. before I was able to separate the side. I've wasted more than an hour installing two of these dimmers in 2 separate sets of my kitchen lights and now I can pretty much only use them with really bright settings. Any dimming of less then 50% brightness will introduce random flickers.\n34#Produit int√©ressant. Avec le bouton d'ajustement pour les caprices des diff√©rents LED, c'est vraiment un produit int√©ressant.\n35#Flickers with LEDs. Unfortunately I bought three of these as I liked the design but now that I have installed them the LEDs flicker every 30 seconds to 5 minutes. I even switched the circuit it was connected to just incase there was interference on the line. I have it now on circuit with very little other devices. The flickering also happens on two separate light runs (as seen in the video) so it is not related to LEDs themselves. I am under the wattage and the flicker happens as low or high dimming settings. Unfortunately, I did not get them installed before the return date. I am going to have to replace them with a different dimmer, I am sure they work on some LEDs but really not the quality I expect.\n36#Operates smoothly and feels solid. These are easy to install -- without requiring any special skills or extra room in the switch box. All the screws are firmly attached and it feels like a really high quality. I wish I had these for all my dimmers they look fabulous, adjust easily, and feel smooth and crisp in operation.\n37#Great dimmer. Worked with LED's, incandescent and halogen no problem. FYI, nothing works (dims) with low voltage (12v) halogen bulbs so you would need to change to 120v ac halogen bulbs to make them dimmable with any dimmer.\n38#Works as stated. Works as expected\n39#sur l'achats de 6 interrupteurs 2 ne fonctionne pas..... tres decue de vos interrupteurs. sur 6 interupteurs 2 ne fonctionne pas tres decue.\n40#They may work for you... not for me! Unfortunately this dimmer did not work for me. I install 2 single pole and 1 three way next to each other in a 3 gang box. The 3 way controlled 6 LED MR16 lamps through an electronic transformer and the single poles controlled 1 lamp and 2 lamps also through an electronic transformer. In spite of the adjustable thumb wheel position, the lamps flickered in all levels. There is also some cross-talk going on between the dimmers, adjustments made to one would also affect the others. Perhaps they may work better in an application that does not include electronic transformers or drivers.\n41#Cheapest dimmers on the market. Only got around to installing it after the return window closed. It flickers like crazy it gave my little brother a seizure (I‚Äôm serious). One second doesn‚Äôt go by where it does not stop flickering it‚Äôs a like disco. Cheapest dimmers on the market - don‚Äôt buy\n42#Ordered 3, gave up after 2 installations. 1st installation was on normal lights, the switch was doing a noise while the dimmer was active. The sound was not perceptible at full light. I installed a 2nd one a group of 6 LED in ceiling. 1st problem...the sound like if there was a huge amount of flies hiding behind the switch. 2nd problem the it would only apply 15% of light reduction before the switch would simply stop working. For example, at 25%+ of light reduction If I would turn the off the light I couldn't turn it back on unless I would bring back the dimmer to 15%. On a 3 way, it is extremely annoying and if defeats the purpose since we always have to go back to the dimmer switch. I spent over an hour playing with the adjustments to try to find a solution, to the 2 problems...found none. I'm sending back these products.",
