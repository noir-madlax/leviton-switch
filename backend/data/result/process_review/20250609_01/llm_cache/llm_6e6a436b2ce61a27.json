I’ve encountered some challenges with these switches. After spending several hours trying to establish a connection, I’ve noticed they can be quite glitchy. One of the switches got stuck in Away mode, causing the lights to turn on and off randomly, which was frustrating. In my efforts to resolve the issue, I removed the switch, but unfortunately, it now won’t reconnect. Additionally, when the secondary switch in the 3-way setup is turned off, the Ulink switch makes a persistent clicking noise, which can be quite annoying. Regrettably, we’ve missed the return window and now have 20 of these switches, so I’m hoping for some guidance on how to address these issues.\n1#Works well. Wiring is different than just 2 plain 3-way switches. If you are not familiar with electrical wiring I would recommend having an electrician install. Although I am not an electrician, I have been wiring houses off and on for many years. It still took me a bit of figuring out (including some changes at the light fixture. Also, as there are many wires (with wire nuts for each) you may need a deep box as the switch itself is fairly large. Alternatively, you can get a electrical box extender which is not as nice looking (as it extends the box out from the wall) but does give enough room in the box if you can't change the box. Outside of the physical installation, The configuration was pretty easy. You have to download the app to your smart phone but from there on it was easy, even connecting to Alexa. Unfortunately for me, the light I had thought was dimmable wasn't so I was unable to check the dimming.\n2#Great quality dimmer switch. Easy installation, great quality and I love the touch dimming\n3#Once lose Alexa pairing useless. Connected and able to control with Amazon Alex for about a day and a half. Then lost pairing and unable to register again no matter what I do. Online reviews show MANY who purchase this switch have the same exact issue and there seems to be no fix. Utec contacted me via email and ask me to try to link to Alexa again and I tried the same process that previously failed many times times and it connected immediately, and I am now able to control with Alexa again now. Thank you utek\n4#Doesn't respond to the 3-way dumb switch. No voltage control. ESP32-C3 inside. The instructions pretty much set up the dumb switch as an on/off signal to the smart dimmer, which then itself changes the light setting. A voltage test confirms that it is set up to do just that. But the dimmer doesn't respond Also, there's no way to set the maximum and minimum brightness levels. So you'll have your fingers crossed to see that it doesn't cause flicker or a dead zone for your specific bulbs Otherwise seems fine. I prefer this particular click and capacitive touch over another brand that I tested. Still, if you can't do what you say you can do, 1-star *Can confirm a second unit does not respond to the 3-way dumb switch **Chip inside is an ESP32-C3 which is extremely configurable. Not the easiest to get to, but definitely possible non-destructively. I don't want to give points when you can't do the job you claim to do. But there's a lot to say for being able to completely cut out the 3rd party service\n5#Great switch. Easy to install works very well, it's dimmer features are cool by the touch of your finger\n6#It gets the job done. A nice switch that gets the job done. Alexa can turn it on and off and dim it. Works fine. Arrived new and on time and boxed in a lovely box.\n7#Does not work with Google. The item description and box both say that it works with Google, however, when you install the app it says it only works with Alexa. Otherwise, it works as intended.\n8#Me devolvieron el precio del producto. No se pudo conectar al Internet. Y los del sevicio al técnico se comunicaron con migo y me devolvieron el dinero.\n9#Estetica buena. Muy buen producto\n10#Doesn't Turn The Lights On... I connected everything the way it instructed. But when i flipped the breaker back on and tested the switch, my lights would stay off. This is a Bad Dimmer if it cant handle three light bulbs...\n11#Best Dimmer Switch! The Smart 3-Way Dimmer Switch has been a fantastic upgrade for my home! Setting it up was super straightforward, even without any prior experience. It’s great to control my lights with Alexa and Google Assistant, making it incredibly convenient to adjust the lighting without getting up. The dimming feature works smoothly, providing just the right light for any situation. I also appreciate that it connects directly to my 2.4GHz Wi-Fi without needing a hub, keeping things simple and efficient. Plus, the FCC/ETL certification gives me peace of mind about its safety and reliability.\n12#ETL certified. This is ETL certified so it's safety is assured. However it was too large to fit in my switch receptacle.\n13#Smart switch. This 3-way functionality is great. I can control from multiple locations. The smart features lights remotely when I am not home , making it a convenient and energy-saving addition to my smart home system.\n14#Instructions / support are incorrect and/or incomplete. Followed the instructions for \"load-side\" 3-way dimmer installation. Unfortunately, modifications must be required for the \"line-side\" switch which are not included in the installation instructions and support was unwilling or unable to provide. When the dimmer switch was installed as a single pole switch, it caused my dimmable LED lights to flutter and then flicker when dimmed.\n15#Perfect Smart Switch for a Seamless Smart Home Experience. I’ve been using the Smart 3 Way Dimmer Switch for a few weeks now, and it has completely transformed my living space! The installation was super straightforward, and I love that it doesn’t require a hub. It synced effortlessly with my Alexa and Google Assistant, making voice control a breeze. The WiFi connectivity is rock solid, and the mesh network ensures consistent performance throughout my apartment. The dimmable feature is a game-changer, allowing me to set the perfect ambiance for studying, relaxing, or entertaining friends. The switch is responsive, and the app interface is user-friendly. It’s also reassuring to know that it’s FCC/ETL certified, ensuring safety and quality.\n16#VERY slow to turn on light, even physically at the switch. Needs lots of space in box. After I installed this U-tec dimmer switch, my wife only used the physical on/off once before asking me uninstall it: the lag is much too long between tapping the switch and it turning on the light. Unless this switch is being installed somewhere that a long delay of 1 or 2 seconds is not going to be noticed, pick a different switch. Which is unfortunate because the switch has good installation instructions and comes with labels for the wires, faceplate, screws, and wire-nut connectors. All I needed was phillips and flathead screwdrivers, and electrical pliers. That and lots of space in the electrical box for the big switch housing and its integrated wiring. This is the largest smart switch I've installed. I tried to replace a main Levitron 3-way dimmer switch with this one. It turned the lights on/off and dimmed them, but as soon as I changed anything on the other dimmable switch, the lights kept turning back on. Swapped the old Levitron back in and the 3-way works fine again. Maybe this dimmer switch only works with a dumb on/off only switch as the other switch in a 3-way configuration? The mesh idea sounded appealing, but I can't use these switches for my house. I thought about giving a 2 star rating, but they might be okay for someone that doesn't care about the lag time or 3-way problem.\n17#Works well. The switch does what it says that it’ll do. I didn’t run into any complicated challenges with the installation. Syncing the devise was a smooth process.\n18#Smart dimmer! This is a super smart Dimmer swith, bought it for my kitchen lighting. It took me just under 15 min with the instruction sheet to self install without any issues. It is a perfect switch size that fits in the regular switch board. The connection diagrams are accurate and works as expected once this has setup with the correct connections. It looks great in my kitchen and easy to operate. The Dimmer settings holds up well on the switch for last settings and retrieves it original settings once it is turned on. The switch can also be control with the u home app and it took me just 5 mins to set up the device in the app for essy access. The automation part is awesome and works as expected. It is very inexpensive and easy to setup. Love my purchase and I recommend this for evevyhome for Dimmer switch at home.\n19#simpley. I bought this to experience something different I thought it was difficult but not just follow the instructions It works well, only my wall is a little small but the use it has is great\n20#Easy to use once setup. This smart dimmer switch looks cool and is easy to use after its been setup, I like that it supports Google assistant so I can controll it with my voice\n21#Upgrade that old boring switch. I've had some switches like this before and wanted to upgrade another one that was for the stairs. It was a 3 way and this did the trick. I had the neutral line in the box, I checked before ordering. It was easy to install by following the existing switch wiring. A few wire nuts later and it was ready to go. This is a decent sized switch and there will be plenty of wire in a box for a 3 way, so you will most likely need a deeper box to install this. This switch doesn't activate like a standard decora switch. It's more of a lever style. The top doesn't move and you just push the bottom of the switch to click it on or off, the touch slider in the middle is to adjust brightness. This does have a more satisfying click than this other similar smart switches I have. more of a positive click than a springy higher pitch click. Hard to describe but it just seems better The no screw faceplate is a nice touch, except the brand name is embossed on it. Kind of lame and I wish it was just solid. I did not use it. I also wish the switch didn't have a little lamp on it and was just plain. Most major switch brands don't need to advertise right on their products what they are.\n22#Works Well. Easy to setup!\n23#Easy to install plus home automation. I ordered the #UTec 3-way Smart Dimmer Switch to install in our dining room. We recently replaced the builder grade chandelier with a larger chandelier which has a lot more bulbs. Now the dining room is too bright. This dimmer switch solved that issue and gives us the ability to fine tune the amount of light depending on the mood. Installation was straightforward and it does need a neutral wire to be installed. It didn't require any additional space inside the box and the fit and finish of the final product are excellent. Operation of the switch is easy and it's a matter of sliding your finger up/down the center of the switch to dim/brighten the room. Integration into the Echo ecosystem was easy as well and we had voice control in a matter of minutes. Very happy with the UTec 3-way smart dimmer switch and will order more for other rooms in our home.\n24#Great dimmer. I love this dimmer!! My husband had it installed quickly and ready to use. Download the smart things app and connect to your google or alexa and you are set. You can schedule when you want it to go on or off as well as setting your brightness which is a great feature if you don't want people knowing you are away. Everything works smoothly and I am looking forward to purchasing more for other areas of my house.\n25#Quality switch with great WiFi capability - control from multiple phone apps. We all dream of turning lights on and off without getting up. This is better than clapping. Just turn it on or off with voice commands through Alexa or Google, or through a phone app. Laziness at its finest. Works well for us. My husband’s complaint was: it won’t work if the WiFi goes down. True. But if the WiFi goes down, it is exactly as if we have a normal light. . . which we have already. Seems like a win to me. We installed in a basement room where the light often gets left on and we hate to go down late to deal with it. Good dimmer functionality.\n26#Easy to install. First and foremost, I love the fact that this is very easy to install. Even with the slightest bit of DIY experience, you’ll be up and running in no time. Just be sure to shut the power off and you’ll be fine. I love the fact that this doesn’t need a separate hub to work. If you wanna go ahead and have a light switch with a dimmer that makes your home smart then this is a good product for you.\n27#3 way dimmer can be wired with standard non-smart switches. I have 2 switches in 2 different locations to control lights in my attached garage and got this switch because I don't have replace the other switch. It needs to be installed in junction box where power is split and the other switch may need to be slightly rewired to send power back to the traveler wire. Back of the switch has aluminum cover to cool power electronics. Screw free wall plate, wire connectors and mounting screws are included. You can use other decorator type face covers for installation into multi-gang junction boxes. U-Tec app offers the same features as Smart Life and can be integrated with Google Home app or Amazon Alexa for voice control or multi-device smart scenes.\n28#Easy to use and install. This dimmer switch works well in my environment where I needed a three-way switch, already easy to slide up and down and install easily within the wiring. Instructions were clear but basically retrofitting existing switch. This is very easy works well within my smart environment with my hub.\n29#Works perfectly! I used this switch to replace one of the switches on my 2-switch kitchen light. It was simple enough to install once you figure out which wire in the wall is which -- a multimeter really helps here -- just be careful with the live voltage until you figure out which wire is which. At this point, turn off your breaker and begin connecting the wires. The included wire nuts make this easy! You may need to get a larger wire nut if you are connecting more than 3 wires. I have a deicated 2.4GHz IoT network at home, so connecting it to my network was pretty straightforward. The U Home app made it simple and the connection to Alexa work flawlessly.\n30#Great price for a WiFi mesh switch but sadly uses a proprietary app. Ordered this wall switch for our hallway light. This smart switch has the ability to be controlled by my voice (using Alexa) or by the U-tec app. It is frustrating to me that companies feel the need to spend tons of money and man hours trying to “reinvent the wheel” making their own standalone phone software when there is no reason for such wastefulness. More than 50% of all smart devices use one of two industry standard apps, either Tuya or Smartlife. Surely one of these app could have done the job for U-tec and they could have spent the money they saved on developing new product! As for this product, the dimming at the wall is smooth and defiantly stepless. I love the feel of this smart wall switch. The WiFi mesh means it can be installed pretty much anywhere in the house and still have a good connection. At the time of this review the U-tec Smart 3 Way Dimmer Switch was selling for $21.99 which is a good price for a 3-way WiFi mesh switch. Despite the disappointment of the proprietary app this is a great quality switch and I highly recommend it!\n31#Works great with alexa. This is a great smart dimmer switch, works well with Alexa and Google Voice. The installation is straightforward with step to step instructions. Just make sure the neutral wire is available. The setup to get it connected to the app is also simple. The only complain is that I hope the manual switch could be more responsive.\n32#Works with Alexa. I have several switches installed that work with Alexa but this is the first dimmable one. The switch is pretty easy to install. It can be used as a single pole or a 3 way switch. I installed it as a 3 way. I really like these three way switches especially since I only need one smart one and can keep the other as a regular 3 way (non smart) switch. The dimming works great. I love a dimmed light when watching TV.\n33#\"Real\" 3-way smart dimmer switch. The last 3-way smart switch I got was not actually a 3-way switch, it just claimed to be in the description. This actually has the traveler wire and works with a 'dumb' switch. While only one side has the dimmer control, since it is also voice capable you can dim the lights from anywhere. Physically, this is on the larger side, so you do need to make sure you have ample room in your switchbox - but being a 3-way dimmer smart switch, the size is as expected. Setup is not only relatively easy, but this may be one of the most comprehensive set of instructions I have seen in a while. It literally walks you step by step through the installation procedure, even if you do not have a lot of electrical experience. Healthy load handling capacity, 430 watts incandescent, and 250 LED or CFL. That's a lot of lighting. The finished product is very high tech, the sliding dimmer is first class. No moving parts, you simply swipe up or down with your finger, and the indicator lights follow. There is also an indicator light glowing whether on or off, green when on, and white when off. If it were a completely dark room, you can easily find your switch. Also lets you know it has power and is live. Very nice product lives up to its expectations.\n34#Very good value. This works well and is VERY inexpensive compared to similarly capable products from other brands. U-tec has for years made some of the (if not the very) best smart locks on the planet. This is a nice entry into the smart-lighting arena. For the price, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better switch. I don't love the tactile feeling of the switch, but that is true of literally every smart switch out there. They all use shallow, clicky microswitches. Or, as here, the mechanism feels a bit mushy. Every smart switch FEELS cheap when you press the button. That's a shame. But at least for now, there's nothing to do about it. Nobody makes a good one. The dimming mechanism here is nice--much better than switches where you just have to hold the button down to dim--which invariably causes the light to dim way too fast, so you always find yourself overshooting your target and it often takes several tries to land on a dimness level close to what you want. Installation is fine--about the same as any other smart switch. Note that you need a neutral wire (if you don't currently have smart switches, this will be the white wires in the box that are currently doing nothing--just connected together with a wire nut). If you don't have a neutral wire in the electrical box, you will have to find an alternative. There are a few smart switches on the market that work without a neutral wire. Lutron and GE both make such switches.\n35#Doesn't Work, Bad Support. The dimmer isn't working and when I tried to get support they replied that I should get an electrician to rewire my house. Even though my mechanical switch works perfectly. Not great support. They also said that the dimmer doesn't work with incandescent bulbs because they're not dimmable; incandescent bulbs are inherently dimmable. Not great support. I would never recommend this dimmer switch.\n36#Nice dimmer. This is a nice dimmer, unfortunately my light seems to have issues with dimmers, not the fault of this dimmer though, another Leviton dimmer didn't work either. My light flickers. I'm going to use it for a different location. The bottom is a nice push button and then you slide your finger up and down over the lights to change the brightness, that part worked and was really nice. The WiFi app and connectivity is also a nice option to have available. I'll try and update once I move to another location but from what my tests were with the bad light I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this dimmer.\n37#Switch! Installing this switch was easy. It worked with the light at the location. No issues at this time. Easy to use.\n38#Neutral wire required. I'm sure this would work for certain applications, but I ordered this a little knee-jerk. This requires a neutral wire, so if you have older wiring this may not work. There are smart switches that don't need that neutral wire, so that is important to know. I have a very old house, but I thought the wiring going to the outlet I was planning on using this on had been recently replaced. It had not, so no neutral. Another thing to take note of is it only works on 2.4ghz. I'm sure I'm not the only one that never used 2.4ghz WiFi, so disabling it made sense. The emergence of smart switches seems to be bringing it back, but make sure you have that available. All said, it feels like a good quality switch. It would have looked sharp and been very convenient in that room, but I guess I'll have to find another place to put it.\n39#Easy to use single pole light switch. This is a good light switch that wasn't too difficult to install. I like that everything can be controlled in the app as well as using the Alexa or Google assistance to control the light in the bedroom. I like that I am able to dim the lights either by voice, in the app or on the wall switch itself. Everything is working well and hopefully this light switch lasts for many years to come without any issues.\n40#Excellent quality led dimmable light switch. I received this dimmer light switch well packaged in excellent condition. Out of the box straight forward installation, black wire line power, red wire load to light, white neutral, green ground, and blue to 3-way switch. I only have single pole and I used wire nut & tape on the blue wire. Switch works perfect manually and with the app. Program feature to set dimmer and it returns to that setting when powered off and back on. I installed for a 3-pendant LED light, and no flickering no matter what the dimmer set at. Excellent quality attractive switch.\n41#Dejó de funcionar. No lo compren, aparenta ser un buen producto, funcionó 2 meses y ya no funcionó correctamente. La aplicación tiene Bugs, comparando con otras apps es un poco más complicado configurarlo.",
