Excellent product! I have several Gosund smart devices and find them to be the most reliable when compared to other brands. I moved into a new home and wanted a dimmer on some recessed lights but also wanted to use it with my Alexa system. The design of the switch with the screw terminals is a space-saving design but having to install the tiny screws that are included is a little inconvenient. I am an electrician by trade so this isn’t a big deal. Setup to Alexa and Gosund app is a simple and fast. Dimming control using Alexa is so convenient, too. I had purchased a Leviton model from HD but took it back because it required another accessory device to work as a 3-way. That is not the case with this model and it works perfectly when installed as the switch with the power feeding the circuit as shown in the device instructions.\n1#Convenient. Installed very easy and was quick to set up with Alexa. Love being able to control the lights with voice commands and set up on a schedule. Looks nicer than other dimmer switches.\n2#Won't dim enough. Only dims the LED lights by approximately 75%. Emailed manufacturer and they advised no update available.\n3#Great switches! Excellent switches. I setup via the Gosund App then connected with Alexa. Work fantastic. Ordered 3x now. No issues since 2021 in 3 different houses!\n4#Failed after 2 years. While it worked it was nice. After just a couple months the wifi feature would not work. After 2 years switch stayed on full and would not dim or shut off.\n5#Plastic is garbage. Im an electrician, i did 2 whole houses with these. The tabs that hold in the switch are too thick so the plate doesnt sit flush!\n6#GARBAGE quality, defective right out of the box. 1 of the switches in the box was defective. This is typical for this brand and the second time this happened to me. you're better off buying a better quality product, not this cheaply made POS. My electrician said he's seen a LOT of switches from Gosund fail. Save yourself the trouble, buy a better quality product, like Levitron or Lutron. and Amazon customer service sucks. lesson learned.\n7#Hardly considered dim. After taking the time to replace 4 in my home I was not pleased to turn back on the breaker only to find they dim to about 50%. I can see why people have returned these. Save yourself the grief and money by avoiding this product if you want something that dims with any control from 50%-1% of control.\n8#Not working. I bought a box of 4 the first 3 where working but yesterday i was about to install the 4th one and it doesn't work at all, now i cant get any help about it.......\n9#Malfunctions. They malfunction after a while.\n10#Does Not Dim Enough To Be Worth Buying. I installed one of these before in situation where I just needed some dimming from the brightest setting. Bought 6 more so I would not have to go through the installing the multiple apps as I have been doing before hooking up to Alexa or Google. In this case the dimming was more important, needed to be turned very low. That is how I discovered these are TERRIBLE for this. They will dim the lights but not enough, you might as well leave these on or turn them off completely. Look at the other low star reviews. If your just trying to adjust the light during daylight in a room they will work, but forget about a soft glow at night.\n11#Great Dimmer switch, easy install. Install onto current wiring with no issues, sits flush to wall. I have used both the dimmer and non dimmer options and they work great with or without the app.\n12#Greate product. Working right of the box. super easy installation. Defenetly recommend. Very affordable. Thanks.\n13#The switches work great. I install these decor switches in my customers homes and they love them. They work very well with Alexa.\n14#Great Smart Home Product. These switches have changed the way we manage our home. Easy to install and integrate into the wifi system.\n15#Didn't last long. I bought two switches and they lasted for a while.Sadly one of the two stopped working. Despite my best efforts it can no longer be configured. So it's unable to connect to the wifi. The other one can be reconfigured just fine so I know how's its done. One the brightside I can manualy turn it on.\n16#Price. Very easy to install\n17#Blinks on/off at night. This switch keeps waking us up in the middle of the night by randomly blinking green and/or turning the lights on at full. Can’t figure out how to fix this issue. I will be ripping this out tomorrow and throwing away.\n18#These do NOT dim below 50%. The description says they dim from 1% to 100%,, but they don’t. Even at the lowest setting at 1%, the light output is 50%. It will not go lower than that. I just paid an electrician over $1000 to install six of these in my house, and I can’t even use them. I turn all of my lights completely off at night now because I can’t get them to dim enough to be comfortable at night. Very disappointed. I also just noticed another review from someone else complaining about the same thing, and they have not fixed the problem or updated the description.\n19#Más de lo que esperaba !! Este artículo si que cumple lo que promete muy fácil de instalar me encanta que la aplicación es súper práctica compatible con Google , son de las cosas que te hacen fácil la vida !!! Lo controlas desde el teléfono la pides programar y listo la calidad es muy buena , no estoy teniendo ningún tipo de descuento con mi reseña pero cuando algo realmente me gusta lo comparto , bastante bueno para creer el precio mejor !!!\n20#Major quality improvements from previous versions. We had one of the switches on previous versions of this product fail. I was hesitant to purchase again because the previous iteration had some quality issues, but we didn't want to replace all of our switches just because one went out, so I purchased again. However, I was very pleasantly surprised upon receiving the item that the packaging was new, the product looked similar but the quality was much better, the screw holes were standard size (a big problem with a previous version), and all in all I was very happy with the updates. It seemed to be primarily a quality improvement, rather than a complete redesign which meant it fits perfectly with our previously purchased switches (gosund) and it isn't immediately obvious aesthetically that one switch is a different version. Very happy to see a company actually listen to consumer complaints and make quality adjustments.\n21#SO EASY to set up!! This is the very first thing I’ve ever wired together! So my experience level was ZERO prior to this. Everything was so easy to diy and connect! I’m using in combo with Linkind dimmable RGB smart bulbs and they work GREAT together! You have to download ANOTHER App (GoSund) but other than that, once connected to the app, go into the Alexa app and search for GoSund switch (if Alexa doesn’t automatically connect to it - she usually does though) and boom! You’re in business and feeling accomplished 😎\n22#Excellent Product and Support. We have several Gosund products in our home, each device was easy to install and works flawlessly. I had to contact support on a few occasions and each time, we received a response and solution promptly.\n23#Touchy controls. We have been using this for 6 months. When tapping the switch to turn on the light, we usually end up setting it to 10% (or less) because the dimmer slide is too close to the on switch. Also it looks and behaves different than the on/off switch of the same brand. Not very attractive to see different switch designs next to each other.\n24#READ THIS BEFORE ORDERING. If you're looking to buy a dimmer for low lit options look elsewhere. I ordered 6 of these switches with high hopes I had finally found the perfect touch dimmer switch with wifi capability. Unfortunately I've got to keep searching. I tried everything through the app to see if there were options for setting the low light trim and there is nothing to lower the lowest setting. Usually on a dimmer switch there is a setting or a toggle switch to lower the lowest setting to where the lights can actually be off at the lowest dimmer setting if you want it that way. This switch at the lowest possible setting was about at about 50% power. The product images show that it can be set from 1%-100% which is completely false. There is no trim setting. With all that being said I unwired and boxed everything up and didn't even begin to try to pair with Alexa. No need because my main concern was with being able to dim the lights to a low setting for evenings and events and it was as bright as daylight still. Returning all of them.\n25#EXTREMELY disappointed! These switches were easy to set up with the Tuya app but DIMMERS??? They barely dim at all even though they are 'supposed' to have multiple settings. I'm extremely disappointed and after having 2 of the 4 installed by a contractor (and paying for it), I'm now having to also pay to have them swapped out as well. What a waste of money! I should have just stuck with Levitron- Lesson learned; RETURNING!\n26#Very Smart and good quality product. Awesome switches! This was easy to install You do need a neutral it works great with Google home\n27#Does not dim correctly. I installed two dimmer switches, from four pack I bought, they do not significantly dim the lights at all. I’m very dissatisfied with this product. I have bought other dimmer switches that work with Gosund app.\n28#Easy to install and setup. I ordered the GHome Smart Dimmer Switch to replace existing dimmer switches we had in our home to be able to control them with our voice using the Alexa app. The switches were easy to install, came with helpful labels for the wires, and were simple to connect to Alexa. Note: You'll have to install yet another smart home app to use these switches. (I really wish the smart things community would get together and combine into a standard app.) Of the four switches included in my order, only three worked. One was dead on arrival. I wish I would've installed them all right away, so I could return the defective one. Other than the one DOA switch, the only negative comment I have is that they don't dim low enough. Our previous switches would dim significantly more. We would leave them on their lowest setting for watching movies, but the GHome switches are still so bright on the lowest setting, that we have to just turn them off and do without the low light now. If you are looking for dim lighting, you might want to try a different brand. The lowest setting seems to be about 50-60% of the full level.\n29#All about 3 way dimmer switches for led lights ... For diy, on any switch more than three way switches, only one station switch can be dimmable the other sit up for on and off only , or you'll get flickering lights , Think about it !!\n30#I rarely write a bad review. Paid for a box of 4. Received a box containing two switches and 4 plastic plates and all screws are missing. It’s a shame this was not inspected before packaging the product.\n31#Didn't work. My husband is very tech savvy and has installed most of our homes smart devices. Motion lights, smart thermostat, TV's, stereo equipment and other items. So installing this was frustrating when it would not connect and believe me he tried several times and watched the video and read reviews. They may work for you but not for us. After all that we decided to just spend the money and install the good Kasa light switches. No issues with Kasa and they were installed in just minutes.\n32#Smart switches. Awesome switches!! I have these throughout my home and love them!! Would definitely buy more!!\n33#Nice looking but practically pointless switch. Switch and everything works well. But the design is practically pointless. See why below: - The on/off toggle is within the press of the switch as well as dim control. So, whenever you try to on/off the switch you will either set the brightness to too low or too bright 99% of the time. You have to be very careful in not touching the touch control for brightness when turning the switch on/off, which is highly impossible as you would need to spend more than 2 seconds to operate it. I had 4 of these for bathrooms and they are useless as they can be too bright or too dim when operating at dark hours :(. My purpose of buying is too make them automatically off after sometime/schedule using Alexa the control of brightness is the annoying byproduct! Quality wise they are okish..\n34#Do not buy. I installed more than ten, and all failed after a year.\n35#Look the same but got different brand. I ordered GHome brand smart dimmer but got Gosund brand smart dimmer. The product look the same as the photo but not sure if it is the same product or not. Easy to installed and seems to be working fine (dimming up and down properly manually and via voice using Alexa). It remembered the dimming setting level when you turn it on again.\n36#item not working. not working.\n37#Does NOT work with Alexa toggle function, nor does green power light work as shown. First, I posed my questions here and got no response from the manufacturer - that is minus 2 stars. I have a pile of Smart Life smart switches in my home. They work great, work properly with the Alexa toggle function (instead of 2 separate routines for on and off, the toggle feature allows you to put one routine so whenever you call that device, it will turn either to off or on depending on current state). This only became clear AFTER I had installed these switches and was programming them. The other thing, and yes it is being picky, but the picture in the ad shows the bottom power light in green. When all of my other switches are off, the green LED power button comes on so you can find the switch in the dark. When these switches are off, all you see is a tiny white LED at the brightness setting when it was turned off. The app is rudimentary but functional, more for showing ads than versatility. It is clunky with limited functionality. I found that the switches were just as easy to set up in SmartLife so all my switches, even these Gosund switches, are in one place for Alexa. So they work but not as well as they should. No response from manufacturer.\n38#Works with Google Home, easy to program. Relatively easy install, pairs easily and integrates with Google Home app. Very easy to program and schedule so that outside lights are now automatic, which is what we wanted it for.\n39#Easy to install. We’ve been remodeling our house and slowly replacing all the light switches to smart switches. This brand has been our go to for all smart switches and plugs. Easy to install and connect.\n40#3 years with this plug. Well i will give a heads up on these switches. They worked well for a while, but what i dont like much now is the light on the switch, they are really bright and get irritating after a while if you like a dark room, the dimmer is nice but it doesnt go as low as alot of dimmers, and just like someone elses comment on here after 3 years one of my switches doesnt work when you click on it and the most irritating things is it clicks off and on by itself now, starts to blink green then light comes on and off and there is no stoppin it. Had to by another one just until i replace all switches around house\n41#No Smartthing Support. I was hoping that this would work for me but it does not. Time to return & pay more for something else.\n42#Relatively easy to install. Bathroom vanity\n43#Good buy. Not much to say but the product worked as advertised\n44#Great value for the money. Great price\n45#Trash. They're terrible. They CONSTANTLY disconnect from the internet and require intervention to work weekly. What a waste of time and money.\n46#Easy install. Very easy install. Works well with alexa. Very nice dimming action\n47#Not good for bedrooms. Works as advertised but the built-in leds are very bright in a dark room and will keep you up at night. We like our ceiling fan turned on but not if the switch lights up the room. There is a setting for \"LED indicator off,\" but it does not turn off the brightness level LEDs, just the on/off LED. The brightness LEDs are great otherwise.\n48#Excellent smart dimmer. Easy install!",
