Great product, easy to install, and works as described. It provides enough light to make it possible to find in the dark. No more fumbling for the light switch.\n1#It's hard to go wrong with Leviton. It's hard to go wrong with Leviton. I prefer the ones with an audible click as sometimes the silent ones can be iffy after a few years.\n2#Very well made. nice replacement light switch.\n3#Good for dark places. A great addition to restrooms, closets, and other dark areas where a smart switch wouldn't make sense. Went thru and upgraded most of my light switches. The ones that went replaced with a wifi switch were done with these lit toggle switches. Have bought a few of these \"white\" illuminated toggles along with a few of the \"clear\" illuminated toggles, same brand... These dont pop as much as the clear toggle but are still easily seen in the dark.\n4#Quality product ! Lights up … to locate switch in the dark !\n5#Something Wrong with the internal Design. I've had to return two of these now to Leviton for arcing internally when turning on or off. Both failed in less than 1 yr. ( quit completely and No LED running anymore ) Load is only 2 garage ceiling LED Petal lights. Wired 14/2 Cu with stabs and then tried screws. * Note - Leviton Did respond quickly with replacements both times and their QC Dept is following up. Tried to tell me there were bugs in the switch from my house ( with pics ). I have no bugs in my walls and my J boxes are all foam sealed. The bugs ( Mayflies in the pics) are not from around here. Maybe from the Country of manufacture? Ive heard and seen the 3rd switch arc 3 times now in the first few months since install. I'm done with these. 40 yrs in the industry and have never had to change a light switch for failure in my life.\n6#I really like these power switches! I think the night light around the boarder of these switches are neat, just enough light to see where the switch on the wall is!\n7#This switch is great. I wanted a switch that was lit at night so it would be easy to find in the dark. It works very well. I would purchase it again.\n8#Ear form. Nice item. Fast shipping\n9#Lighted switch. I bought for my mother so she can see switch in dark. She likes switch.\n10#Works well, a nice upgrade from builder's grade switches. I installed four of these today in the master bathroom. The builder installed the switches in 2011 when our house was built. One of the four was shorting out and might have been a fire hazard. I bought four of these and replaced them and they work great with nice solid switching. The light in the surround cannot be seen during the day and at night it is not real bright. You have to install with ground wire on left and the two hot wires on right otherwise you will install them upside down. Worth the time and effort as DIY project for little money. Turn the power off at the breaker box before messing around with wires.\n11#Couple of annoyances. As some other reviewers pointed out, the switch has no \"on\" or \"off\" labeling like a traditional switch. This is because to save money, the single pole version was engineered to be identical to the three way version, just with a paper-like plug in place of the third screw. It even retains the \"common\" terminal label on the case. Because of this issue, you have a 50/50 chance of getting the orientation right on installation. And wouldn't you know, I got it wrong. I am here to tell you that you need to install the switch with the lettering UPSIDE DOWN if you expect up to be \"on\" and down to be \"off\". That is to say, it is BACKWARDS from how it is shown in the manual. The terminals should be on the RIGHT with the switch in the vertical orientation.\n12#The backlight always stays on. Do not like for the light to stay on when using on outside lights because I wanted to be able at a glance to tell if switch was on or off\n13#Lighted Switch. Nice upgrade switch. Backlit feature is nice at night in guest bath.\n14#Good illuminated switch which oddly doesn't label on, off. Overall - very good. Toggle action is good. Not too much or too little resistance, IMO. I prefer this version with a solid white toggle and perimeter light, as opposed to clear toggle. I installed in a bedroom & may have to tape over the lighted portion or replace with a non-illuminated switch since I've been told it's too bright at night. So, it may be great in a Hall or other room, but perhaps not a bed room if very sensitive to light and where it is relative to the bed. The toggle does not have \"On\" or \"Off\" printed on the toggle, which I found odd for a single-pole switch. So I checked continuity before installing so that up was on & down was off, the first time. Perhaps one can tell by which side the wire screws are located, but I wasn't sure. No big deal, just odd. I'd rate it a 4.5 if I could, since I think a product has to be really outstanding to get a 5 (if equating same to a 10). Would buy again.\n15#Does not resolve issues of the older neon lit switches. As far as a backlit toggle switch it's no better or worse than the old neon backed toggle switches. However, it is marketed as resolving the issues those older switches have with LED light fixtures. I installed this switch but the light still has ghosting issues. That's the entire reason I bought this, so I wasted my time.\n16#Differentiate Light VS Fan Switch. Not real great for night light purposes, but it does make it easy to fine the light switch in a dark room\n17#Works great. Works great\n18#It works. It's a switch. Tuurns things on and off. Oh, and the switch lights up. That's nice.\n19#Never lose that switch again. Lighted switches used to be that ugly orange neon; gone are the days. These are white light and are quite attractive when installed. I used only a screw driver and pair of needle nose pliers to get it done in ten to fifteen minutes. Would recommend.\n20#It’s Leviton! It’s a light switch made y Leviton which is a very good manufacturer.\n21#Still have ghosting in some applications. The switch works fine in circuits with 5 or 6 recessed LED lights, but still causes ghosting in circuits with only 1 or 2 lights. I believe it will work fine for circuits with at least 4 recessed LED lights, single lamp circuits have a faint glow and 2 lamp circuits about half as much of a glow. Screw in LED lights work well in any quantity.\n22#Too bright. These lighted switches use a bright white halo around the toggle that can add too much light to a room: especially if your bed is in line with the switch. The switch might ok for a garage or a storage room I suppose, but if in a living area I would reconsider.\n23#Loved this switch. I didn't end up getting pictures because after they came in, and we hooked the first one up - I realized that I needed a 3 way switch instead of a single light control switch. We have 2 switches controlling the same lights. Anyway...the one I did hook up gave us a nice 'white' but dim light that won't disturb your sleep if you have to walk down a hallway in the night to use the restroom. That said, you will be able to find the light switch location easily in total darkness. Many of these types of lights have an 'orange-ish' glow. These were more modern LED white - which I would prefer. Side screws AND quick hook up options here. Good switch - GREAT PRICE!\n24#It’s a damn light switch and it will last forever. The title says it all\n25#Great quality. Convenient and easy to install\n26#Light fixtures still glow. I installed this switch to control 4 - 4' led shop lights. When off the shop lights glow faintly. This was supposed to replace an older light switch meant for florescent lights that also caused this problem. Will check with tech support for a solution.\n27#Green, very dim and ony lights up the upper left corner if the clear part around the toggle. I would NOT buy these again. First, the light itself is green. Did I miss that somewhere in the description ? Second, when the toggle is off, the green light is very dim. And, of the clear ring around the outside of the white toggle, only the upper left corner is lit up green. I tried three (3) of the 5 switches I purchased and they were all exactly the same. I also did two things. Thing 1: I used regualr incandecent bulbs and that made no differene at all. 2: I set up a test circut in my work shop with a single 60 watt incandecent bulb and on its own circuit. It also didn't make a difference. I would certinly NOT recommend this particular item. The purchasing and shipping process went okay. It's just that thr product is not worth the money. I'm over to Lowe's latter today to purchase a Cooper lighted toggle switch (all white no clear ring) that is made for LED bulbs. Well, you will some you lose some.",
