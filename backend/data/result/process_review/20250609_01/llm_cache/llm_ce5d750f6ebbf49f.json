After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Rocker Style Dimmer Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Rocker Style Dimmer Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment. Include all mentioned reasons, or \"?\" if none can be inferred. <USE_REASON> and <USE> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- <PHYSICAL>/<PERF> and <DETAIL> MUST NOT include:\n  * Generic statements without details (e.g., \"good\", \"bad quality\")\n  * Issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., \"fast shipping\", \"delivery time\")\n- If a review mentions any physical aspect, related performance, or use together, extract them as separate entries under \"phy,\" \"perf,\" and \"use,\" with no overlap.\n- Make sure each <DETAIL> is under the most relevant <PHYSICAL> or <PERF> in the context of Rocker Style Dimmer Switches\n- Preserve negations\n\nKey Instructions:\n- Break down reviews with multiple aspects, performances, or uses into individual entries.\n- Escape special characters with backslash that could cause JSON syntax errors.\n- Include only explicitly mentioned reasons, and use \"?\" where no reason is mentioned.\n\nFinal Checklist:\n- Go through all reviews and ensure that no aspect, performance, use, or reason is omitted, even if only mentioned once.\n- Review all entries to ensure proper separation between aspects, performances, and uses.\n\nPrint the JSON result only.\nInput format:\n<ID>#<review>\n\n[[INPUT]]\n0#Good product. These are the best dimmers on the market\n1#Good. Working good\n2#Exactly what I needed. This little dimmer was easy to install and works very well. Was perfect for what I needed!\n3#Item is yellow not white. I purchased three of these as I have other Lutron dimmers in the house but this switch has a hint of yellow and does not match the other white ones I have.\n4#QUALITY PRODUCT - EASY TO INSTALL. CEILING FAN - WORKS WITH CFL AND LED LIGHT BULBS AS NOTED ON BOX (WILL NOT WORK AS A DIMMER FOR LED ARRAY)\n5#Simple and Work Well. Easy to install and work great on LED retrofit ceiling can lights.\n6#This is the dimmer for LED lamps. This is the dimmer to get for LED lamps. It's specifically set up for LEDs, CFLs and incandescents. An earlier Lutron dimmer worked fine for CFLs and incandescents, but when I changed the bulbs to LEDs, it would not turn them all the way off. I had to use the little pull-out/push-in switch at the very bottom of the dimmer to get the LEDs off completely. Swapping in the Lutron Maestro C.L. dimmer solved the problem. No adjustments needed; it worked perfectly as soon as I turned the breaker back on. Note: Don't attempt to wire these in hot. The electronics can be damaged and so can you!\n7#Four Stars. It worked with my LED lights in a 3-way installation.\n8#Five Stars. Easy install and works perfectly.\n9#Buy something else. Poor instructions The tagged wire, right. Wires NEVER COME TAGGED. In the off position the LED lights still glow all the time, just at a lower level.",
