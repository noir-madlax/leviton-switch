When they work, they’re fine. But they often disconnect from the WiFi, and I’ve noticed that they cause lights to flicker. I bought three and one constantly fully freezes so even pressing the button doesn’t work, causing me to have to pull the air gap and reset the switch almost daily. There was a time where an update was pushed that crashed all the switches permanently too. I had no light in three rooms for week when this happened while I waited for replacements. Overall, if I was renovating again, I’d go with another switch.\n1#Don't buy this switch. Will not stay connected. Disconnects regularly. Now won't reconnect.\n2#Do not buy! This item did not work by itself, it did not work with other Cync products and it would not stay connected to the internet. DO NOT BUY! You’ll waste at least 3 hours factory resetting and adding and deleting devices all for it to never work properly.\n3#Wireless not working. Well, it’s my second one, and the wireless function stopped working after just one month. I wouldn’t recommend it.\n4#doesn't work. stopped working the minute i got it connected to my phone and turned my light all the way on. couldn't get it to turn back on in any way. been trying to set up a lightswitch so that i can turn my light off from my phone, and this one had the gall of getting all the way to connecting before crapping out on me completely.\n5#Works Great. Works great! Installed it myself too!\n6#Works with Cync app only, will not link to Alexa. Does not work with Alexa, the Cync app skill does not work, lots of reviews with the same issue.\n7#Slow delivery and tracking was not accurate. Delivery was 16 days when I expected it to be delivered in 5-6 days. Price was a decent value. I have not installed the dimmers yet so I cannot say how they function.\n8#Basic dimmer for specific lights. I bought GE Cync undercounter lights and could only use this dimmer if I wanted to be able to dim them manually instead of using my Alexa or Google Assistant or the app. The price was equivalent to a regular dimmer. The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the fact that you MUST use only this dimmer. But it works well.\n9#Poor customer service from GE. Stopped working after 18 months. GE would not replace the dimmer switch via warranty because it was controlling a lamp, and not a hardwired GE CYNC light. Bad customer service.\n10#Works Great. Works great, didn't need a hub and was easy. to install and use.\n11#Poor quality and unreliable. Avoid buying. After a year, I finally replaced my Cync switch with a different brand and it’s been night and day difference. Cync has been very unreliable for me. Using my smart speaker, it worked like 50% of the time. It also constantly emitted an annoying hissing sound. I am happy I got rid of it. I do not recommend this product to anyone.\n12#Works great. Very easy to install\n13#Flickers on no neutral and no ground. I had high hopes for this dimmer, but it just kept on flickering and restarting when installed without a neutral and a ground.\n14#Work well, but lots of bugs. As a disabled engineer I bought several of these to make my life easier at home. They work, but have a few snags that I would think GE had solved by now, it's 2025! I chose the version that does not require a neutral wire because my house is older. I got them all working, but had the following problems along the way. 1. These don't work with generic (Walmart) LED bulbs unless you install the bulb adapter they supply. You only need 1 adapter per switch, even if the lamp has multiple bulbs. BUT, what do you do for lights that don't have a traditional bulb - you have to call GE and get a \"fixture adapter.\" Really? 2. If you install these in a multi switch outlet (with 2 or 3 or 4 switches behind 1 cover), the cover will have a gap behind it. Very annoying. These switches are thick and a generic cover won't sit flat against the wall, and GE does not sell 2 or 3 or 4 switch covers, only singles! I had to research \"deep switch covers\" and buy several online. Or recess the GE switch into the wall a bit. 3. Mine would NOT work with stainless steel switch covers, which I have in my kitchen. It seems a metal cover blocks the WiFi. So, I had to replace the SS covers with plastic. No warning about this in the manual. 4. I use one of the non-dimming versions to switch a ceiling fan that draws well below the 5 amp limit (as stated by GE). They last about 1 year, then burn out. They get hot and smell like burning plastic. Two have failed this way! 5. They never work the first time you add them to the phone app. You must delete the switch and start over in the app. The 2nd time you add them, they work. Confusing. 6. Good luck getting them to work on a 3-way circuit (2 switches on opposite sides of the room controlling 1 light). GE says it will work, but you have to replace both old switches with these WiFi switches. Neither I or my electrician got it to work. Finally I converted the 3-way circuit to a simple 2-way by bypassing 1 switch and installing just 1 of these WiFi switches. Overall, I give these a 2 out of 5 stars. They work, but need much improvement.\n15#Not so smart. WiFi keeps dropping at random... Purchased 4 of these switches for my ceiling lights. 3 bedrooms. No neutral wires as advertised, great. But.... I wish the Wi-Fi could stay connected for a lengthier period. After 2 months of operation. Numerous of network setting tweaks and tests. Nothing can keep these switches from disconnecting. They don't usually drop all at once. But sometimes it does. Because of Wi-Fi drops daily, or sometimes every other few days. The longest it stay connected was 6 days. Just shine of a full week. Which prevented the Google Home to communicate with it quite often. When it stays connected then it is great. But the short lived smart home experience fades away rather quickly. It can provides so much convenient to my household. Only if it could stay connected. So far, the result is a mixed bag. Giving it 3 stars because the GE App can still switch on/off over bluetooth the phone app with a button consistently (not over WiFi). Meaning I do have a remote switch on my phone. With this old house. Having any convenience is better than none. I'm considering it a consolation prize. PRO: *Easy installation. *No neutral wires is required. *Dimming works great *Light effect fade away to off. Fancy! *GE App works for the most part over bluetooth. CON: *Constant WiFi drop / disconnect *No Google Home voice control or any button commands due to the unstable connection form these switches. *No new firmware support or update over its WiFi connection issues. Shameful. *2.4hz module cost WiFi interference. *Bulky build. Small size conjunction box will not fit.\n16#Cync switches seem to be garbage. First I got this dimmer style and had the same problem the non-dimmer. I got the other one thinking the dimmer was the problem with the light type. I got this for a hardwired light so the adaptor wasn't an option. I got the app to see the switch. When it tried finding the network it didn't see it 5 out of the 6 attempts. When it finally saw the network the app refused to connect. (I have multiple bulbs and two outlets working on app already.) The last time it tried connecting to the network the switch just stopped working. It still feeds power to the light, it's just unswitched, constant power running to the light. The light ring doesn't light up and the air-gap and a circuit breaker reset doesn't do anything. The app won't recognize it anymore. Seems like the cync switches are garbage. Must be why Lowe's stopped carrying them in-store and aren't even doing a ship-to-store.\n17#Stop being smart after a month in service. Update: While I was originally impressed with these switches, that is not the case after they've been in use for a couple months. They stopped working with Alexa after about a month, and now they lost their WiFi connections and will not reestablish the connection no matter what has been tried. They still work as manual switches, but nothing smart about them. If you do a search you will see that others started seeing the same problems at the start of 2025. I am holding out for a firmware update, but I won't wait long before I ditch these. Original review: There are not a lot of choices for smart switches when a common wire is not available in the switch box. This is the best one available. I used them for three way switch wiring (two switches for one light source). Works great. One tip that's not clear in the documentation: put each switch in a common group when you're setting them up in the Cync app, then reference that group when you're turning the lights on and off. This is especially important for dimmable lights.\n18#Terrible often loses smart capability and now it's just a switch that doesn't even want to dim. Terrible often loses smart capability and now it's just a switch that doesn't even want to dim. Little to no support from manufacturer\n19#Unreliable. The dimmer never worked and after several months the switch started making the lights flicker. Electrician replaced and remarked that the switch was properly installed…just originally faulty.\n20#Product stopped working after 60 days. It installed beautifully. Connected to my WiFi without any effort. Was very problematic trying to program with a dusk to dawn timeframe as it crossed over into another day. After 60 days, the unit has locked up and will not function at all. It is in a closed status right now, so my lights are always on. Should have followed the warnings to avoid a frequently returned item. Unfortunately, the return window for this item is only 30 days. Considering this a loss and learning experience.\n21#Awesome support. This switch is super nice. When I connected it, the dimmer portion did not work. When I contacted support, the guy I spoke with was super helpful. I just needed to connect the switch to their app and it started working perfectly.\n22#Keep disconnecting. Switch disconnected a couple times a year and had to go through a hassle of repairing. Also required an inline bulb attachment which a lot of recessed lights don’t have and especially an issue when connecting multiple lights to one switch. Then it would only be relatively stable up to 85% brightness.\n23#Only kind of works :/. This device kind of works, it turns the light on and dims it and you can do this from the app but will not let me control it using the voice assistant so it is kind of useless for me. Also I could not get it set up at all in the second room I tried it in.\n24#Works great until they dont. I am constantly deleting all the devices then deleting the app to then restart from step one to get them to work again. Probably once a month.\n25#Stay Far, Far Away. Research these things online before purchasing. Could never get them to work as the account creation process would not work. Keeps saying the email verification code is incorrect. Reading some reviews on these elsewhere shows I made a decent mistake purchasing these.\n26#Thing is Boss. This thing is Boss. Older home here, only had a hot in and line out to our dining room lights and was sad there weren’t too many options for a smart switch that did not need a neutral line. I also thought at first glance it was weird looking since it doesn’t look like any other light switch on the market - but this thing is Boss! (I’m bringing that word back) Super easy install, I like how it looks, at first it wasn’t dimming and I was worried my old chandelier wouldn’t work with it (since they send a weird light bulb base adapter thing (capacitor? resistor?) they encourage you to use but the thing is huge and wasn’t going to work for me) but once I downloaded the GE Cync app it worked like a charm and easily connected to my Google home account or with Alexa. Very pleased and will likely need more of these as I renovate about the house. Video includes audio of my daughter fake crying and my dog drinking water, and I couldn’t show it working with voice commands but it works great.\n27#Unreliable. I purchased four of these switches, and all of them are a pain in the back side. The switches seem to constantly lose Wi-Fi connection and need to be reset which includes taken off the plate and pushing a tiny button, blah blah blah. These really stink.\n28#3 out of 4 worked. Bought 4 units. I liked the idea of no hub and no annual fees. I'm using Insteon in one home that require hub and fees....Three out of four worked. The boxes were sealed but only two came with optional light socket and one box had no screws or wire nuts. I ordered new units so I'm not sure what happened there.\n29#Switch is good, app is so-so. Like title mentions, the app is weird. I actually can't control the switch when I am not in the house.\n30#So disappointing. Purchased a new GE Cync dimmer switch. But received a used cruched box with missing parts and broken socket to be used with the switch. If I wanted to roll the dice with a used product I would have done so. Not worth the $40 for used beaten up product\n31#Hit or miss. The wiring is easy, and it works without a neutral wire, however half of the time Alexa is unable to communicate with it. Update: Fix found on reddit: -Disable the GE Cync Skill -Enable it again -Login and MFA (if needed) - MOST importantly: For one of your devices, you need to rediscover it. I have a smart switch that's easy to get to. Just reset it (On/Off/On/Off/Hold for 10 seconds. Blue light flashes). Add it back into Cync and all devices starts working again.\n32#Great item! These replaced some crap that Amazon didn't stand behind. When buying things like this spend a little more on a name brand. This one is highly recommended!\n33#Great but with an important flaw. This is great because you can get a version that does not need a neutral wire, which is hard to find in a wifi smart switch not requiring a hub, setup is easy, the app is decent, integration with google home works fine. Installed onto incandescent lights in a ceiling fan device and it works just fine. But there's one important flaw. Once wired in, the switch emits a very quiet and very high pitched whine. If you have background white noise or are over the age of 50, you probably won't notice this. However this becomes noticeable when installed in a bedroom at night when it's very quiet and you're trying to go to sleep. Can still sleep through it, but it's annoying, fixing this issue would give 5 stars.\n34#Didn’t work for my set up. I don’t have a neutral wire in my house so that’s why I bought this. It said in the label that it needs to be like 6 volts for it to work or something like that without the adapter. And my lights had that much voltage but it still didn’t work Customer support said I have to use the adapter, but the description and packaging said I wouldn’t have to use the adapter if I met that voltage requirement. The reason this is an issue is because of 6 lights that are all small light bulbs. The adapter is for a big light bulb so I couldn’t use it\n35#APP DOES NOT WORK OUTSIDE THE US & CANADA !!!!!!! Just found out that the app for this produce is not available outside the US and Canada. With no reason given by Customer Service... and can't find this restriction anywhere on the product page.\n36#Garbage switches and system as a whole - stay away. We have had nothing but nightmares with our whole Cync system, including these switches. Nom-stop connectivity issues, disconnecting every week or so. We gave up trying to use it as a “smart” system, now they are just very expensive on off switches. The waffer lights will just random come on, sometimes in the middle of the night. Lights constantly blinking randomly. If you have 2 switches right next to each other, even if you go through the setup and connect them to the correct lights it’ll turn on every Cync light in the room, so now we have to switch out Cync dimmers with regular dimmer switches because this system should never have been sold to customers. GE should be ashamed. Thousands wasted on a system that is worse than old fashioned lights and dimmers. This may be one of the worst products I’ve ever purchased. Stay away unless you want nothing but problems.\n37#Ease to set up. I like this product a lot. I bought two for two separate rooms to control recessed led lights . They work great with Alexa\n38#AVOID this Switch!!! Update to my previous review. AVOID!!! I can’t get it out of set up mode and now blinking is keeping my 3 year old awake at night. I should have listed to to the other reviews. Garbage! But WiFi app control keeps disconnecting. I have other wifi switches that have neutral wires and a different brand. Since adding this switch there seems to be interference as my other switches that worked great for over a year, are now disconnecting randomly as well. Also, this doesn’t connect with any other apps. So not recommend.\n39#Do not purchase! I bought 4 of these light switches. The switches are very finicky. If you were to ever loose power to your home you will have to program each switch back up. Good luck with that. Stay away.\n40#Flawed technology. DO NOT BUY. I bought 5 of these for my home less than 2 years ago. All 5 are having issues with disconnecting power to the lights all the way when turned off and also disconnect intermittently to wifi for no reason. All keep the dimmer lights on even when switched off. There is a low hum still in lights and if you take out all but one bulbs in the series to make the room dark the one lol that is screwed in flickers. Maybe there is a software update needed or something because they are all having serious issues that should be unacceptable for a light switch that is 50 times the price of a basic functioning one. DO NOT BUY. This product will not last and perform basic duties.\n41#Becarful! I bought this a bit ago in anticipation of moving into a new house. I know it does not have a neutral wire, and I was hoping to not need a hub, this seemed perfect. I was having issues testing it out, talking to support it seems the restrictions of lights\\\\fixtures is pretty big. I tried 5 different fixtures\\\\bulbs and it never did work. Their support was responsive but not helpful. Ticket was responded to by several people who repeated what others said. This is useless for me and I waited to long to return it.\n42#Work good, wish they didn't update so often. They work well if you don't have a neutral wire. Definitely the most economical option for old house wiring. If you don't need then for that reason, get something that doesn't need to update over wifi so often... I don't even understand why they update?\n43#GE products decreased quality. This dimmer switch failed after 3 months. I generally avoid GE products but bought this because I couldn’t find another make with no neutral wire. Big mistake.\n44#Doesn’t work - don’t buy!!!!!!! Switch continuously cycles on and off. The ring turns red, then light switches off. Then ring turns white again and lights turn back on. Cycles on and off once a minute. So once a minute all night long the light is flashing on and off. Waste of money. Waste of time. I won’t EVER buy anything from GE. Hey Amazon sellers, quit selling junk like this!\n45#Great product. Great product easy install\n46#AVOID: (updated) It MIGHT WORK INITIALLY but won't last! I bought this for one simple scenario: I want to put a two-wire dimmer switch under Alexa's control, so that she can adjust those lights when I watch TV to reduce glare. It's a first-world problem, but it's very irritating. This totally fits the bill. Alexa integration is great. Setup is slightly confusing but isn't painful. The red flag: many have reported quality issues with this device. My device failed within days of installation. I ordered another one and that one has been working fine for a month. Will update if the replacement fails. I wouldn't normally even bother, but there aren't very many no-neutral smart dimmers, and rewiring the switch for neutral is just not feasible here. My advice: if you want to give this a try, SERIOUSLY, order double and return the broken ones. UPDATE: after two months, the replacement unit has the SAME SYMPTOMS. This device has SEVERE quality problems with its integration. STAY AWAY.\n47#Perfect, no neutral. This did exactly what I needed. I originally bought a set of kasa switches and was doing my whole basement. Then I came across a switch that was wired old school and didn't have a neutral wire. I found this one and popped it in and it's been great.\n48#Works Well with Google Home. Works with dimmer LED recessed lights. Integrated well with Google Home. Easy to install if you are a regular DIY type person.\n49#Look great but loose signal sometimes. These look great and work good for the most part. I have had them lose signal a few times but after a reset they reconnect quickly and work fine afterwords. They also connect to our Cync led lights we put under the cabinets and control those as well wirelessly. I just had to sync them in the app.",
