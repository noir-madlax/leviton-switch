The switch simply does not work. I am experienced in installing these switches. This one does not function. The light wired to the switch does not come on with this switch, but it did come on after using a different and better product.\n2#Didn't work. After installing, it would not work.\n3#Easy to install. This is the first time I installed a light switch. I never had to before. The switch came with great instructions and it works perfectly. The primary reason I bought it is because I needed 1000w switch. I highly recommend it.\n4#Works like a charm! Unit arrived quickly. Change out was quick and easy using the old, broken unit as a wiring template.\n5#This dimmer could not handle 480 watts. This dimmer is rated for 600 watts. I put 480 watts through the dimmer. In 9 months, the dimmer feature was burned out. Could only be used as an off or on. switch. I bought a replacement dimmer, different mfg.\n6#Five Stars. Works Great!\n7#Excellent having 1000 watts instead of the standard 650. I have bought a couple of these now and they work great, easy to install and my first install has been in heavy use for a couple of years now. What is key about this is the 1,000 watt. The ones sold at my local hardware stores and big box stores are all 650 Watts and if you have more watts than that (I do) they heat up like a political debate on gun control… you don't want to touch the issue.\n8#Works great, solved overheating problem. I'm a fan of these dimmers because they blend in with other non-dimmer switches and are reasonably priced. I bought this to replace a dimmer switch of a lesser wattage that would overheat when controlling a 14-bulb chandelier. I no longer have the overheating problem.\n9#Bummer...inoperative. Unfortunately, did not work out of the box, which had been previously opened. But the connections did not look like they had ever been connnected. Electrician got me another one from different vendor and it worked fine.\n10#good product. This dimmer switch does the job that I expected it to do and has enough watage that there is very little heat problem from it.",
