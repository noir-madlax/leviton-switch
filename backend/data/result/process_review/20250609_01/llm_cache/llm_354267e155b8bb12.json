After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Multi-Function Combination Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a.

It’s cheap quality. Cheap quality\n1#Simple and effective. Did the trick. Served a niche function effectively, on a budget.\n2#Usability. Switch tab is really hard to remove requires digging into switch case to separate power\n3#Tricky installation, squishy switch action. My main difficulty installing this was clearance between housing and bolts heads. The clearance was too narrow to simply swap each wire from old to new switch, I needed to straighten, insert, and then bend each wire around the bolt. If the bolts were just a mm longer, I could have slipped on each wire hook fast and easy. Switch action is not as smooth as my old 1996 variety, but gets the job done. At each end of stroke, there is noticeable squish, requiring extra pressure to overcome the detent.\n4#Electric switch. Easy to install.\n5#Solid switch. Positive on/off without loud click.\n6#It switches rough. I bought 1 and the switching function was rough, so I opened it up to try and see why. Let's say I had a really hard time putting it back together (it has a lot of pieces inside). After getting it together the front case wouldn't close unless held together. I got it hooked up and 1 switch controlled all 4 lights. So I tossed it. I bought another one and after googling I Come to realize it was obviously my fault, I was supposed to snip the side pieces to separate the 2 switches. Hooked it up and it worked. The rough switching was the same on the 2nd one too. Must be a design flaw\n7#Saves a lot of money if you can fix it. Awesome product.\n8#Works great. Ez to put in. Looks great too\n9#Functional. Very easy to install and working the best it can!\n10#Double toggle switch. It’s a good product it performed as per specifications I like this very well\n11#Wengart Double Toggle Light Switch. Good, quality double light switch at a great price! Thank you Wengart!\n12#works fine but in my opinion only use for leds no heavy load. i have installed many many plugins switches and the like in my nearly 25 yrs of electrical work, now i should say that i am not a qualified or certified electrician in any state but that dosnt matter, normally plugs and switches have a certain sturdyness of there build but this dual switch sorry to say dosnt scream sturdy product i can only assume like most everything else lately covid has dried up what little profit there was to be made in building a quality product so costs must be cut and corners prob did to, with this said i see no issue if its only being used for a couple led lights but not high draw devices, now all this is only my opinion and may or may not be right in one or all aspects who knows but be sure like allways to check the quality of any product\n13#Bright White, Both Toggles Work, Easy Install, Very Happy! This Wengart Double Toggle Switch is the standard bright white color. The install does take some electrical knowledge or an electrician for the job. The toggle switches work fine and cover screws are in the correct area so that the cover was a breeze to install. Great Product!",
