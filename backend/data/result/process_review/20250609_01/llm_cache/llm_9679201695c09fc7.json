After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Multi-Function Combination Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Multi-Function Combination Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>.

Light switch works fine, installed it easily. It comes it the amazon bubble mailer nothing else as pictured here. One star less for no product box or other padding.\n1#loose. Only one of the two switches worked and was delivered loose in an amazon bag without original package\n2#Just what was pictured. Worked great\n3#good product. worked well\n4#Let there be light! After watching a few YouTube videos, I just wired it the way the previous switch was wired as I had 3 black wires. No wires were color coded which would had helped immensely. Anyway , it fixed the issue and the lights work again!\n5#Trash. Didn't work. Total junk\n6#Working as intended. Working as intended\n7#Doesn't work. Ordered \"white\", received \"almond\"...not the end of the world. My neighbor, an actual electrician, offered to replace existing broken switch for me...both switches turn both lights on, no separation of function.\n8#Good. Fine switch\n9#Done. Just what was needed to complete the fix!\n10#I have light again. Easy to install (especially if you call \"the guy\". Works as it's intended.\n11#Good product, works great. Like it fine and product works great.\n12#worked great. worked great and I didn't have to go to store so a win win\n13#Works well! -I installed this over a month ago, and it seem to be working very well as of now!\n14#Redoing all our outlets, covers, and switches. We ordered these to redo all the outlets on our main floor. Great quality and very white. Perfect value for the money.\n15#Compra util. Muy útil y buena calidad\n16#good quality, easy to replace. good quality, easy to replace. Replaced older broken piece. It took 25 min.\n17#Quality product. Easy way to separate bath light/fan on single switch.\n18#Worked exactly as it should have. I matched the light switch in the wall to the pictures of this light switch on Amazon. And it worked exactly as it should have. (I had bought a double light switch locally, that was similar, but it didn’t work properly). This light switch worked.\n19#Good price Good product. Better price than the big box stores, good quality, and it was delivered to our front step! What more can you ask for?\n20#It it a light switch and it was not a quiet one. I thought this one was to be a quiet off and on switch but it was not, but it works for now.\n21#Great quality light switch. I installed this light switch very easily. It functions very smoothly! Love it!\n22#durability. solid product\n23#Works as expected. Bought this double switch combo for my lighting project and worked out just great. Delivery was very quick. Overall happy with the results.\n24#Good Quality. Not much to say except that it works as intended. I picked Leviton because it is a known brand & I've used their product.\n25#Good Switch. Its a switch that is easy to install.\n26#Worked great a little stiff. My last switch prog snapped off. I ordered this one worked great and was easy to replace my only gripe is it is kind of stiff but I'm assuming its cause its new. The packaging was just a envelope no protection at all, lost another star for that. Mine wasn't damaged but it could happen. Came very fast and no other issues.\n27#Worked perfectly. Bought to replace a switch that had been getting stuck for a while, and this was the perfect replacement. Great product.\n28#Nice Prime pricè. Ea$y to install replacement.\n29#Good. Good price. Fast delivery\n30#Nice. Seems like high quality and was easy to install.\n31#It's not white. The description claims it's white, but I was sent beige. No screws.\n32#Two switches in the space of one. Worked great. Replaced similar switches installed 50 years ago. I had never seen these before so was thrilled to find replacements.\n33#Works, but feels cheap. Very cheap feeling switch. Actuation isn't snappy, extremely mushy feeling, and very sharp edges on plastic. Easy to install, but only offers the screw terminals instead of the slot type termination. All in all, it serves its purpose, but for the price I wish it were a little nicer feeling.\n34#Works great. Easy install works great.\n35#Fits on a single gang box or ring. It is a nice replacement switch.\n36#availability. convenience\n37#Works with Lutron Aurora. Had to search far and wide to find a single-gang, double switch that was \"industrial\" grade with the thick switches. This has normal size switches. I use the Lutron Aurora which clamps onto the switch as a dimmer for smart bulbs, and almost all of the switches I came across would be too thick for the Aurora to work. Happy this one works.\n38#Works fine but not smooth action. The actuators look and feel a bit cheap. Cheaper/weaker looking plastic, sharp corners on actuator, and action is sticky on one of the switches. Surprised this is from Leviton!?\n39#Great space saver. Only had room for 3 switches and couldn't cut into the wall since it was tiled. Purchased this dual switch so I could add another light in the bathroom. Worked out great and the switch uses the same plate style as an outlet.\n40#Great switch. Great product. Shipping was a nightmare! Nearly 1 month. But, that being said, customer support was great.\n41#it's a switch all right! Works fine; replaced a broken one\n42#Receptacle, not switch. Received wrong product - twice! Should be duplex switch, got duplex receptacle labeled as a switch.\n43#Perfect Replacement Switch. This switch was a perfect replacement of the 10 year old one we had. Just what was needed. (Had previously bought a different brand but that didn't quite fit.) Thanks!\n44#Great Value. Great value and easy to install!\n45#Nice switch. Works great",
