This works as expected with no issues and flawless performance. We paired it with a Lutron Caseta Diva Dimmer in an existing 3-way wiring in our home. It is easy to install and functions great. Just be sure to use dimmable bulbs (we’ve had good luck with Philips) otherwise the dimmer and this switch can act wonky. (Pictured from left to right: Diva Dimmer, Claro Accessory Switch, Claro Switch - all Caseta models)\n1#Buggy and hard to install/troubleshoot. Needed electrician. Fussy and buggy. DIY is an over-promise. Need electrical knowledge and skills so be prepared to pay an electrician. I had to and I still have problems.\n2#Works well, no problems with connection to base or app. Works well, no problems with connection to base or app. Very happy with Lutron system. I wish it was cheaper for the switches though.\n3#Amazing. Amazing product. I had my hesitations, but it’s better than Kasa.\n4#Top brand. Great switch. A little bit pricey but do its task. Looks also very elegant on your wall. Easy to install.\n5#Lutron Switch. Sleek reliable smart switch\n6#Expensive, but worth it. These switches are great. Easy to install and setup. The casita system is great! Been totally reliable and integrated really well with Alexa.\n7#Looks nice but comes with delays. I was able to install the switch and would have delays using it with the claro casetta.\n8#Exceptional Quality and Service: Lutron Caséta and Diva Switches are Worth Every Penny! Over the past few months, I’ve gradually replaced over 30 switches in my home with Lutron Caséta Claro, Diva & Aurora models. Initially, I was hesitant to spend extra on the accessory switches, especially since the Caséta and Diva work fine with traditional dumb switches in a 3-way setup. However, after comparing the quality of Lutron’s switches to standard ones, I realized the difference was undeniable.I had two 3-way switches in my living room and kitchen, both paired with traditional switches. The disparity in quality became too noticeable, so I decided to complete the transformation and replace the remaining 2 dumb switches with Lutron accessory switches, for a seamless, uniform look. The installation process was straightforward, thanks to Lutron’s detailed instructions that cover various wiring options. However, I did encounter a situation where my wiring didn’t match the diagram. Rather than guessing, I reached out to Lutron’s tech support on a Sunday evening, fully expecting to leave a message. To my surprise, I was connected to live, US-based tech support person, who spoke clear English. They quickly walked me through the correct wiring process and even followed up with an email outlining the connections we discussed. They encouraged me to reach out if I had any further questions—a level of service that’s rare these days! Now that every switch in my home is Lutron, I couldn’t be happier. They not only look and feel premium, but they also come with the peace of mind that Lutron’s exceptional customer service is just a call away. Pictured alongside the new accessory switch in the 3-gang box, are the Lutron Aurora dimmer and the standard Lutron dimmer switches, which blend perfectly into the overall aesthetic. If you’re looking for superior quality, ease of installation, and excellent service, I can’t recommend Lutron and their switches highly enough. They’re absolutely worth the investment!\n9#Great Product. Great Product\n10#Not a great match for the Caseta Dimmer. So I thought my wishes were answered when Lutron finally added paddle switches instead of the original pico switch. I installed this in a 3-way with a Caseta Diva Dimmer. I'm disappointed that you cannot change the dimmer brightness with the accessory switch , only the main Diva Dimmer Switch (and the Lutron hub). The alternative would be to install a Pico remote switch, but they are so ugly. I cannot explain why they didn't make this accessory switch smart itself, with its own radio.\n11#Didn’t work well. I installed this but found that it was not always turning on the light. I figured it wasn’t getting enough power so I replaced it with a pico paddle switch.\n12#Worth the extra money. Lutron is rock solid. If you want something that just works, go Lutron.\n13#The description of the switch was unclear. I thought the switch would control other switches and the load without having wires in between the two switches. But no you need to have traveler wears in between the two switches. Not just power and neutral but need to have a traveler as well.\n14#Great add on for 3 way switches. This is only for use in a 3 way application. I used this with a Diva dimmer in 2 locations where I had no neutral wire. The \"full\" Claro, non accessory switch, requires a neutral, this accessory does not. But the rest of the wiring is like any other switch. So the Diva/Claro accessory combo worked well in my application of a location with no neutrals. I prefer this to the Pico remotes because these will never need batteries since they are hardwired. The Pico remotes battery life is about 10 years, so not a big concern, just one less battery to think about. Lutron ecosystem is the best.\n15#Received item with a broken ground. I received the switch and it had obviously been installed before and had a broken ground wire.\n16#Easy to install and easy to integrate with Caseta hub and Google Assistant. The wiring instructions are very clear and it is easy to handle installing these Diva Smart Dimmers for 3- and 4-way applications by using Caseta Claro accessory switches. No neutral is required, reducing install time even in cases where a neutral is present in every wallbox. Installing the Caseta Smart Hub and pairing the dimmers with it were straightforward, and integration with Google Assistant was a breeze. Highly recommended!\n17#Reliable and just works. I have been a fan of Lutron products, and this one doesn’t disappoint either. I wish they were a little cheaper but you get what you pay for.\n18#Perfect. Cant go wrong with Lutron.\n19#Try again Lutron. I was really excited about these and what a let down. This is the first time I've really been disappointed with a Lurtron product. I was hoping these would work similar to a Pico but they really do nothing. First off, they're hardwired which I knew. But, I was under the impression you could program the one tap function to go on at the level you set, similar to the Pico middle button. Not the case, they will go on to the level that the main Diva dimmer is set. Which of course gets moved constantly whether on or off. So don't expect to ever know what brightness you're going to get with a single tap. Yes, the double tap will take it to full level and bypass the main dimmer. These are not recognized in the app and can not be programed like the Pico either. Pretty much just an expensive 3 pole switch you must use with the Diva dimmer. Three stars for lutron build and quality, nothing for innovation.\n20#Love it. We just remodeled our home and added these. They work great and are easy to install and program.\n21#1 bad out of 6. I’m one of those people bumping up against my 75 device Caseta limit and have been replacing Pico remotes with accessory switches to get under the limit (want some shades). Generally works nicely, although missing the dimmer functionality of the remote. Does require some patient determination of what wires are available: where is the line voltage, where is the load, which red wires go to which box, etc. and getting everything correctly connected. As for the headline, one of my accessory switches was intermittent in a circuit with a dimmer and another accessory switch. Sometimes it would toggle the light, sometimes not. Replaced it with a new one and so far it’s working as expected.\n22#Love Lutron Smart Switches. This is what I needed to work with Lutron Smart Switch in a 3-way configuration. Similar feel as the Smart Switches and they all work with HomeAssistant. If you are using Smart Switches and have a 3-way, this is the device you need to make it work.\n23#Works beatifully. Extemely glad Lutron finally added a hard wired option for 3 way switches in the Caseta line up. It works perfectly as expected from lutron and their history of rock solid quality.\n24#Work great, without the satisfying switch/click action. So far, they’re 100% reliable and work great. I’m disappointed they don’t have the same satisfying switch action as the traditional decor switches throughout my home.\n25#bad delay when toggling. bad delay when toggling on off or vice versa. not acceptable for this price and advertising. would convert to single pole switch and get a pico rather than use these\n26#Awesome accessory to the Diva switches. They match and have the same look/feel of the Diva switches.\n27#Humming noise. I tried this with 3 different lights in my home, and unfortunately each time there was an audible hum coming from the lights. My regular light switch did not do this.\n28#Does What It Says - Tech Support is Excellent. If you're using the new Caséta Claro Switch or Diva Dimmer in a 3-way or higher situation, then these will give you nice control at the remote switches. For dimmers, press once and it turns the lights on to the level set by the slider at the main dimmer; press again and they go full bright. It would just be nice if you could manually brighten or dim by holding the switch down, but you can't. If you want dimming control at the remore locations, you should use a Pico. If you have any questions about what wires to attach where, call Lutron's 24-hour tech support and they'll walk you through it. They are great.\n29#You get what you pay for. After trying several (many) cheaper smart switches in our 4-way set up we finally had success. This one was easy to install and setup and fully functions as it should. Instructions were outstanding!",
