This is a 3-way switch for upstairs and down stairs light works great easy to install no issues at all very happy.\n1#Used one inventory? I was sent an used one with obvious stain on the front and marks on being installed on the screws. It is a hassle to return such a small item while I am in need of one.\n2#Quality switch. Easy to install. Purchased this switch to upgrade our old switch and it was super easy to install and it seems durable and good quality. Satisfied with it!\n3#Good product. Good product\n4#works well and its nice product. easy installation and do the job perfectly. nice product\n5#Very noisy. Makes a loud noise when pushing the switch.\n6#Faulty product. Do not call an Electrician before reading this. I was remodeling my house and decided to switch all the switches. These switches did not work. I end up hiring a $100 electrician to come and fix the (unknown at the time) issue. He came in and replaced the switch with the $4 Home Depot ones and they worked just fine. I don't recommend these.\n7#Open box with no instructions! Received an open box with no instructions. Very poorly done.\n8#works like it should. built well and works well\n9#Work good. Haven’t had a single bad switch. They seem solid\n10#Bright white and value. These are well designed, bright white, quick and easy to install, and feels nice when operating. A good price value.\n11#Great product. this switch is silent but has a very positive action. It was as described in the listing.\n12#Nice quality. Good product, but I order the wrong item, it was returned\n13#These are garbage! I replaced my whole house with these pieces of garbage and have had to replace just about all of them and they are only barely over 1.5 to 2 years old! Avoid these at all costs! They’re cheap for a reason!\n14#Product is great but Amazon shipped a used device missing the installation instructions. This is my first time using Legrand. I really like their switches. They are low profile on the back and the terminal posts have the additional guard on them that helps hold the wire in and make the connection secure and makes the connection easier to wire. The shark bite connections are neat and clean but a pain if you have to take them back apart. The only problem was Amazon shipped what looked like was a used and returned product and it was missing the installation instructions that were supposed to be inside the box. But a Google search on the Legrand website turned up what I needed.\n15#Not the cheapest, but really high quality. These just work and work very well. A step up from the ones in the bin at the local hardware store.\n16#Terrible. The screws don't come out far enough to get the wire under. These are going back\n17#Horrible very cheap we need press hard. Horrible very cheap we need press very hard and done time it won’t work\n18#Nice Component. Fit and finish of Legrand electrical fixtures is far superior to what I can find in a hardware store.\n19#See for yourself. 3 way switch has been in a spare bathroom for 4 years with little-use…..Seems to be coming apart. Replaced with GE.\n20#Quality. Quality construction. Easy installation Good product\n21#Makes an okay gift! I bought these in May 2020 (for $3) and gave them away and though I cannot comment on their efficiency, the person I gave them to said he still has them over three years later. When I opened them they felt nice and sturdy, but then I wound up installing metallic light switches and these became unused spares. Since they arrived on time and in new condition and they are still being used today, that counts for something! These “Pass & Seymour TM873WCC10 3-Way 15 Amp Single Pole/3-Way Rocker Wall Light Switch, Three, White” light switches get a serviceable 3/5 stars!\n22#Modern Elegance. This sleek and modern light switch is a brilliant addition to my home. Its contemporary design effortlessly elevates the overall aesthetic. The smooth finish and minimalist style blend seamlessly with any decor. Installing it was a breeze, and it adds a touch of sophistication to every room. If you're aiming for a modern look with functional simplicity, this light switch is an excellent choice.\n23#amazing product very well designed. amazing product very well designed\n24#Poor quality. Broke after 2 weeks\n25#Its a three-way switch that works. The switch works the way its supposed to! Yes it clicks with on/off but no problem with it.\n26#Its not white its a grey white. awful do not buy. It's not white. It is an off-grey white and does not match any standard white switch.\n27#Work great. They work great and are a good value.\n28#Quality Switch. The manufacturer (Legrand - Pass & Seymour) makes quality electrical hardware and this switch is no exception. Item works as expected and was easy to install.\n29#Used! I ordered two of these white 3-way switches, they were both obviously used when they arrived! Pictures are attached. One of them had a grey color paint on the edges. The other had dark brown paint all over the mounting tabs and the edge of the switch. Looking a bit closer, the switches are Leviton, the boxes they came in as well as the description is LeGrand! Unless you want used junk switches, I would avoid these!\n30#Works. Does the job.\n31#switch. The switch works perfectly\n32#Works ok after setup, could push wires in for installation but not recommended. ## Updated: 9/30/23 I discovered there are holes on the back to push in wires for installation! I tried this with one of the switches and discovered the traveler wires were apparently in the wrong holes. I tried to push in the release hole with a flat screwdriver to release the wires, but no matter how hard I pushed the screwdriver in the release hole, the wire wouldn’t come out. I am going to return this as defective. If you can’t release the wires then it’s basically ruined. All the basic switches I’m replacing in the house have the same push-to-release wire mechanism in the back, and those work fine (they are made by Leviton). With the other Legrand switch I needed to install, I just used the screw terminals. That worked fine but it’s more time to configure. Anyway, just a warning that the release mechanism for the push wire installation method does not work on this switch by Legrand. ## Earlier review: Just installed and works fine. You can only use screw terminals for the wires to fasten the switch. I wish this also had hole installation on the switch, to push wires in. That makes the installation faster. Oh well. I like the look and feel of the switch. We replaced another switch (non-decora/decorator; a regular flip switch) because its glowing light had started to fail. We got tired of looking at the light flickering in the dark. So annoying! It’s the 3rd illuminated switch we had to replace. We’ll never buy one of those lighted switches again, as the illumination fails after a few years. I’ve used this brand before and it’s been reliable. Time will tell if we have the same good fortune with this one.\n33#Ripped off from the wall! I couldn’t believe what kind of crap they butchered straight out from the wall still with a paint on it and wires sticking out! I thought it was a prank!\n34#Good Price Good Product. A perfect replacement for my old switch. Looks and works perfectly.\n35#💡. This switch brightened my world.\n36#The great price! I searched all over the internet and couldn’t find them any cheaper\n37#dyi easy fix. i am not a fix it type of guy, these were easy and quick on install. would rec if that is what you need\n38#No instructions. Not that I needed them, but this is the second switch that came with no instructions. Plainly written on the box that the istructions are included in box. ??\n39#Noise. Makes too much noise when pushing up or down. Otherwise seems like a quality product.\n40#Works as it should. This switch works as it should but, the way the switch clicks up and down just doesn't feel right. Feels like it sticks. I've had others do the same by this brand but maybe that's their normal. It's wired but it what it is.\n41#Easy to install. Easy to install but the color does not match the plate or the one way switch nest to it. So make sure you get everything you need from the same brand.\n42#Dirty trick. I ordered a 3 way switch the box came already opened I paid it no mind installed the switch when the light didn’t work properly I checked the box and realized they put a two way switch in a box that says three way switch time waisted not cool\n43#Great price. Good quality. A quarter of the price for the same brand and product from box stores. Great replacement.\n44#I like it. Looks good and easy install. Added a screwless cover and looks nice.\n45#Would be better if the push-in supported 12 AWG. Nice switch. But only a 14 AWG push-in can make 12 AWG installation more cumbersome.\n46#Not a three-way switch. Not a three way switch. Three way switches are on/off/on, this switch is only on/on.\n47#Garbage. This was a complete waist money all 4 of these 3-way switches did not work.",
