Hasn’t burned my house down yet.\n1#Does what it’s made for. Overall, this is a great switch so far. For the price you can’t beat the Quality. Install was easy and switch was replaced in about 10 minutes.\n2#Good price. Works great\n3#Easy install, buttons break easy. Easy install, but the buttons break easily\n4#The item works as advertised and the price was good. I use this switch for our bathroom fan that also has a main ceiling light and a nightlight. The quality seems to be good.\n5#worked perfectly. worked perfectly to replace older unavailable 3 stack switch. used for bathroom HLV.\n6#Poor quality, defective, unacceptable. I'll be returning this crummy piece of junk. Main issues: 1. Terminal screws are poor quality and do not engage straight blade screw drivers securely. 2. One terminal screw stripped while securing wire. I used a proper amount of torque to fasten the wire, but the screw stripped and now is not safe to use. 3. The plastic paddle switches do not fit well, and one leaves a visible gap when in the OFF position. 4. The feel of the switch action is different in the ON vs OFF positions. It takes more force to switch them off than to switch them on. Very dissatisfied. I'll be returning this turd, and have already ordered a replacement switch from Home Depot: Leviton brand, which is a reputable manufacturer. I should have done this to begin with.\n7#Works great! Easy installation and switches seem to work well. Good value.\n8#Quality is very bad, dont waist your money on this. it works but when you turn off the switch it doesnt go all the way back. sometimes you have to make sure it went off.\n9#Good to go. Good price and does the job.\n10#Good product. Very happy with my purchase.\n11#Nice switch. Installed working great\n12#Works with older wiring. Well built, solid. Used for a bathroom light fan and heat fixture that was decades old. Easy to connect wires. Switches work well.\n13#They work, but... The button action when you switch it feels cheap and yucky. But like i said the switch completely works. Just feels cheap/janky when you use it. Looks perfect and works perfect. Feels like junk.\n14#Works great! We ordered this when our bathroom switch stopped working. My husband installed it as soon as it arrived and it is working perfectly as expected. Have not had any issues or problems with this switch so far.\n15#Great light switch plate! Mine was broken & this was a perfect replacement!! Great customer service\n16#Works great. Installed myself and buttons work well, doesn't stick.\n17#Works but not great quality. The button snaps on, but soft-closes off (no sharp snap). Wires insert pretty hard, and pull out even harder (difficult to disengage the clamping clip). I ended up going with side-wiring. While it is the lowest cost item with good overall ratings, I don't know how long it will last: many users online say they got 2 bad out of 2, some bought one, got a replacement from Amazon/mfg, had a second subsequent failure, and others got less than 1 year usage before replacing (previous switch in the house lasted 7+ years before cracking through, full failure). The more I think about it, the more I plan to switch to the more expensive one (fortunately, I bought two at the same time, though installed this one as it was a low profile block).\n18#Good quality material used in construction. Sturdy frame, works great\n19#Prompt shipping ! Exactly what we needed and got here QUICKLY ! Will order again .....replaces an old,dated standard triple switch in the master bathroom and looks great ! mi⁸ ....\n20#Don’t waste your money. Got this switch all connected and ready to go only to find out it doesn’t work. Unfortunately this discovery was made at 10p when it was too late to go to the store and replace it so had to go without a bathroom light overnight. Do yourself a favor and don’t buy cheap crap on Amazon, just spend the extra at Lowe’s or Home Depot.\n21#It works! I needed a new light switch for my bathroom as mine were getting tired and one switch recently popped out. We replaced the panel with this one, and it works perfectly. I am happy with my purchase.\n22#Great for a bit. Worked just fine but after only a few months the bottom switch broke and fell off and I just noticed the top one is cracked too. Wasn't able to find a way to contact customer service but it seemed as if it broke way faster than it should have, especially under light use.\n23#Sw. Didn't dislike anything\n24#Good Replacement. Years ago I bought a bathroom light, vent night light unit. The switch for the light wore out. I looked at the manufacturer's website hoping to order a replacement but learned that the model I had no longer was available. I looked for similar models in the hope of buy a switch for it. They didn't have any. I found this one on Amazon and it works perfectly.\n25#broke in 11 months. center rocker switch only lasted 11 months, normal home usage 2x a day --- switch stuck to \"on.\" Other brand, older designed switch, seems more rigid when moved.\n26#Simple design. Been using for six months now. No problems at all.\n27#Cheap but cheap. The switches work. Maybe I am too picky but the holes in the back did not grab the wires well. Also, the feeling of the rocker switch is a little soft. These are picky thinks that only I will notice. If you don't care, buy it! This had a good price when I bought it. Or you can spend a little more on a more premium model.\n28#bueno. fasil su intalar\n29#Works. Replaced a switch just like this which broke. This one has been installed for months now and works as it should.\n30#Works best if you attach terminals to your stranded wire. I'm using the switch for a DC power switching to some LED light strips. It works great for the purpose, but the screw terminals aren't amazing so I just attached a U-shaped terminal to my wires and it seems to work well. Looks great on the wall. Also functions as a 1:3 splitter for your input wire because it switches them off the same screw terminal.\n31#Broken switches twice. Ordered one, bottom switch broken (just flopped in its seat). Returned/replaced, 2nd one had two broken switches this time. Not quality.\n32#Worked for a time. It worked ok but the middle switch broke after less than a year of use\n33#Good replacement for old triple switch. I bought this to replace a old one that doesn’t work anymore. It is exact like the old one so that I have no problem to replace it. The only problem I have is the holes for each switch to plug in the copper wire is too small for older house that use lower gauge copper wire so that I have to loop around the screws the old way.\n34#Great. Easy to install\n35#Great replacement. I got this to replace a switch from the 70's. Makes things look less dated.\n36#Beautiful switch. Easier installation\n37#Junk. This is the second one of these that I picked up. The first one of the switches broke after only a couple weeks. I went ahead and exchanged it giving it a second chance and that was a mistake. 5 months later and it broke. Biggest piece of junk. Dont buy.\n38#Nice looking. Easy to install if u know what you’re doing\n39#Looks much better than a regular light switch. I like it because it doesn't stick out like a regular light switch. It is so easy to walk by and just push it off or push it on 😊\n40#Decent quality. I have ordered before. Easy to install and really updates the look of the wall they’re on. I’m not sure about Alexa integration but will find out soon!\n41#Works as descrived. No issues after 5 months. The switches work with not problems, They have been in use for 5 month with no issues.\n42#Works great. Works great\n43#Switch. Works great\n44#Fácil de instalar. Lo use para la cocina\n45#Buy it. Simple to install… saves a ton of wall space. High quality toggles.\n46#Works great. Nice large switches. Easy to work with. Easy to clean. It was not hard to install. We installed ourselves. It has been working well for us for a number of months now. I would purchase this again.\n47#As advertised. Works as expected\n48#Easy to install. Just as good as the name brand at half the price. Would buy again",
