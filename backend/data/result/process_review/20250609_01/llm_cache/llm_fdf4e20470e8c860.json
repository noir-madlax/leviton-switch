Great to find something you need on amazon.\n1#Great product. Quality dinner light.\n2#Good quality, but larger than basic switch. These switches are deeper than standard rocker switches which takes up valuable space in the existing box, making pushing wires back into the receptacle challenging. It was very hard to get these switches back in the electrical housing box due to their deeper offset, and I was unable to change all three of my original rockers in my 3-1 box. I could only install 2. Overall, the quality is good and they are easy to connect to existing power, but they do take up more space than original switches.\n3#It just doesn't work. Hopefully I just received a lemon. But attempted to install in 3 different locations. Simply would not work.\n4#Great product. I bought these switches with the Lutron gang wallplates. They look really good in remodeled bathroom. I would suggest the satin snow color for a modern bathroom. And they work great.\n5#Great dimmer switch for LED lights. I had a dimmer switch for my ceiling mounted LED light and it would flicker in low settings. This switch if you adjusted correctly you will not Flecker at low settings\n6#Sweet! Recommended for and works perfectly with my Allen and Roth Sloan 6 light 96 inch dimmable LED flexible track light.\n7#poor quality and does not work. Does not properly dim LED bulbs. Poor circuitry leads to poor dimming and flicker. Tested with numerous LED bulb brands.\n8#Five Stars. shipped quickly, no problems\n9#It's not perfect, but good enough. I initially bought a cheap $13 GE dimmer at Walmart that said it worked with LED bulbs, but the lights would not always turn on with the switch unless the dimmer was set to full brightness. It also caused a significant hum/buzz from the bulbs when dimmed below 50% or so. I am using 4 of the the 60-watt equivalent \"Great Value\" brand dimmable daylight LED bulbs from WalMart, which appear to be made by TCP. This dimmer is much better, but not perfect. It does reliably turn the lights on every time, even when set to the lowest dimming level. It has an adjustment for how low the lowest setting goes, which you set to match your bulbs and it works very well. This dimmer is able to dim my bulbs to a very low level while still reliably switching them on, much lower than the previous dimmer I tried. My bulbs ended up being happy right in the middle of the adjustment range provided for the minimum dimming level. At low brightness, my bulbs still hum/buzz a little, but not nearly as much as before. It's not enough to bother me, you can only notice it when the room is really really quiet. The way the switch snaps into position between off and on doesn't scream high quality - it has a very pronounced click and that part of it just feels kind of cheap to me. If I were to buy another dimmer switch today, I might try a different model in my search of perfection. But this one is good enough that I'm not going to return it. I spent hours reading reviews before deciding to give this one a try, and I never found one model that everyone agreed was flawless. I think a lot of it comes down to the bulbs you are using it with and your preferences.\n10#Lurton A Great Standard. As expected, Lutron is a great product. Finally a dimmer that serves many bulb options from incandescent to florescent to LED and at a great price! Satin White is a special order and this served my purpose perfectly.\n11#Garbage. Does not dim lights. Buzzing noise when trying to dim, both from lights and the switch. Turned it up, noise went away. Used CFL bulbs as described would would, didn’t work. I am thinking of changing my light fixture to LED or something, not sure what I want yet, hopefully it will dim those. Because I can’t return I didn’t bother removing from all. I’ll just use it as a normal switch for now. Light does flicker for a second turning it on. I guess I should have tried to install this sooner because now I can’t return it….. pure junk. I wanna possibly change my light fixture\n12#Excelente. Tiene un diseño bonito, cómodo y trabaja excelente con mi lámpara led atenuable\n13#LED PARPADEA. Funciona, y son estéticos, pero el LED parpadea cuando baja del 30% de su potencia (valor estimado).\n14#Good stuff. Everything was good as expected from this seller!\n15#Four Stars. woork well however has phillips instead of robertson screws which we Canadians love",
