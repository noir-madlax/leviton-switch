Worked well as a replacement\n1#Very good switch but now overpriced. Have these switches throughout my house since I remodeled in 2010 and I’m now having trouble with the push button on one of them so I’m looking for a replacement but the prices have gone through the roof now. Might get the cheaper one without the little light in it.\n2#Not new product. Box was tore up. Dimmer appears to have been used.\n3#Brightness. Item is of champion quality. Remarkably incomparable delivery. Pretty packaging.\n4#Zip Zap Zoom Done Works. Easy install (except getting wires though the wall) - added dimmer to old location. Works to dim a big 2x2 square 40W LED light. LIJ\n5#Switch would not work for these LED fixtures. Wanted to dim led lighting but switches wouldn't work I want to return if I still can\n6#Works on LED mirrors. Needed a 0-10v switch to power a LED mirror on a bathroom remodel. Dimmer switch works great and was pretty easy to install, if you have some idea of what you’re doing. If you are new to electrical wiring and/or not entirely confident in your capabilities, I’d get some help to ensure it’s done correctly. Would buy again\n7#The design is wrong. They designed this dimmer switch with a secondary set potentiometer to adjust the top of the brightness rather than the bottom, which would have worked to make sure the bulbs did not turn completely off when sliding the dimmer control all the way down. Who buys a bulb and decides that they never want the bulb to actually display full brightness? Why not just buy a lower lumen output bulb and save some money. The engineer that did this should have a forced career change and clean streets (of course then the hard working people that do that would have to put up with this persons ineptitude.)\n8#Dimmer for LED panel light. I chose this product because it was compatible with the 0-10v dimmer circuit required for the LED panel light I installed\n9#Lighted dimmer. Great product. Easy to use. Nice lighted feature.\n10#Seems overpriced, and the cover kept popping off, but overall works okay. I installed this to control a new set of four overhead 4ft LED fixtures with 0-10V dimming. Wiring them up was pretty simple... normal hot/neutral/ground wires, plus daisy chaining the 0-10V wires between the switch and each fixture. Two complaints though... first, the price seems too high, in my opinion. I wanted the dimming, so I paid the price, but something tells me it shouldn't be as high as it is just for that dimming feature. Then again, something is worth as much as people are willing to pay, so... The other complaint was that until I put the cover plate on, the replaceable faceplate on it kept popping off. I had installed the switch in a double-gang box and until I hooked up the other switch, I didn't have the Decora plate installed. Meanwhile, I was running some other wires in nearby locations, and everytime I'd hammer a wire staple into a stud, the smallest vibrations would make that cover pop right off. It's just not held on very well. It's plastic so it didn't break when it fell to the floor, but still, it seemed chintzy for such an expensive switch. Of course once the cover is installed over the switch, that holds it in place just fine so it's not ultimately a big deal, but it sure was frustrating until then. The dimming itself works well. It's fairly smooth, and the full brightness matched the brightness of the fixtures when I tested them out with a non-dimming switch, as best I could tell. The lowest dim level will depend on your specific fixtures, and I have nothing to compare on that front, but it dims pretty low so I'm satisfied. I have this wired in a 3-way configuration (to a non-dimming switch) so that part of the switch works fine too - it does support 3-way just fine with the traveler wires.\n11#Do not use with LED. I purchased three of these Dimmers. They claim to work with an LED 0-10v system but after being installed for only a few hours I have had failures with 2 of these switches.\n12#Two Stars. Weird responses during initial installation but started working well. then failed just shy of a year...\n13#Good product, works well. Switch/dimmers work well for a custom LED ceiling light fixture my husband built.\n14#Works perfectly with a lighted vanity mirror. Works well and better looking than I expected.\n15#Works as advertised. This dimmer does exactly what it is supposed to and as advertised. Installation is straightforward, instructions are clear and it appears to be of good quality. It has only been installed now for about a month with no issues, so no real long term experience with reliability. My only bump against it is that it comes with 3 different pop on face plates for different colors (white, beige and cream). Ordinarily I would say choice is good, but I would have preferred to buy the color I need and not pay the extra for the unused faced plates. I know why they do it, just think it would be more efficient to sell 1 dimmer and select what face plate you need.\n16#Easy to install. Well made, easy to install. After installing 2 LED panels needed to fit a dimmer switch. Instructions that came with switch were out of date re.model number of switch but this one superceded the old model no.\n17#Five Stars. As described\n18#Not worth it at all ! Dislike - it was cheaply made , very flimsy to the touch , if your paying over $50 for each switch you expect better quality\n19#Five Stars. worked great\n20#Five Stars. fast delivery 5 star sale\n21#Fast and easy shipping, perfect dimmer! This is a great little switch. I use it in conjunction with dimmer packs and transformers for custom LED lighting boards installed under countertops. It features range dimming, interchangeable faceplates, and easy install. Plus shipping was fast and easy!\n22#Basic is good. Works well. I use it to test fixtures being controlled by expensive dimming systems. It allows me to verify individual problem fixtures. For those not needing an elaborate digital controller this unit provides a nice dimming curve at a reasonable cost.\n23#Disappointing. I bought three of these to dim my new LED recessed cans. One works fine but the other two don't. The lights don't dim to the low range... they go about halfway down and then go off. It's bad because it's in my media room where I'd like very low lighting while watching movies.\n24#Works good. It works fine right now, but the last one only lasted about 20 months before it quit working. As much as they cost I would hope that it would last longer than that.\n25#Fourth time is a charm. It has been a month long battle trying to get a Leviton 0-10V dimmer that works, but after the fourth try we have success. The first two were the new Renoir II version that had no response. I have used this dimmer in the past, but wanted to have the nicer Renoir II. Well I guess Leviton needs to go back to the design board on that. I received my first Illumatech and installed to find that it only dimmed from about 10% to 30% on the fixture. Got the voltmeter out and found that it only went from .5V to 3.5V. Got a third return from Amazon which has been quick and excellent on taking care of these problem dimmers. I received my fourth one today, installed and finally success. Major kudos to Amazon for their great handling of problems, big complaints for Leviton either not designing or building products that work consistently.\n26#works well. works as desired for 10vdc LED dimmer. the on/off switch is a little noisy and could be more refined.",
