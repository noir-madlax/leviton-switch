EVERY LAST ONE OF THESE HAS FAILED IN LESS THAN A YEAR SOME IN JUST TWO WEEKS. THE LIGHTS WILL STILL TURN ON AND OFF BUT THE DIMMER - THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF A DIMMER SWITCH - FAILS.... CHEAP PARTS AND THEY SHOULD KNOW IT MAKING THIS PRODUCT A REAL SCAM IN MY OPINION - DO NOT BUY THIS\n1#Mixed results using a 10 pack of these. I had one just fall apart as I installed it. A little tab broke and I couldn't make it stay together under actual use. And another does not properly dim the light as it is supposed to do. The rest, just fine. You can't really argue about the price, but you know the old adage about getting what you pay for. I think I would buy them again if I needed that many.\n2#All broke. All 5 of these failed within 3 years. The switch breaks at its pivot point and then fails to work. AlL FIVE OF THEM ü§¨ Negative stars\n3#Did NOT LAST. I bought the 6 pack of these lights 4 years ago. Now 3 of them are all broken. They wouldn't turn on or off because the switch itself, physically wouldn't work. Even when they were installed, they never actually worked great, and the switch felt cheap. Going to swap out all of em. Really poor product.\n4#BESTTEN paquete de 5 interruptores de luz. Al mudarme de casa, tuvimos que cambiar todos los switches y los tomacorrientes. Estos fueron una buena opcion. Funcionan bien y no son tan costosos.\n5#Used items. Box of 5 items 3 used and 2 like new Change requested so let see\n6#It doesn‚Äôt work like it was supposed to. That‚Äôs not a good product. The dimmer doesn‚Äôt work smoothly, after it‚Äôs installed. Before installation the dimmer goes great - back and forth. Every single one after installed got very hard to be used. So bad that I‚Äôve even hurt my finger.\n7#May flicker with led. The dimming feature works well. They are easy to install if you have basic handy man skills. The look great. They are compatible with most wiring layouts with a few exceptions. Be aware that you may get some flickering with certain led lights when you dim them. I only had this issue on one light and it's notna big deal.\n8#Broken after 2 years - arcing and dangerous. I bought and installed these about 2 years ago. One day my daughter try to switch the light on, it arced, which scared her. She called me to check it out. I tried and it arced again. We could have been shocked but were lucky. Needless to say, i replaced it with a different brand from HD. 2 stars because i got two years of use out of it.\n9#Cheap Material. One can tell if a switch is a quality product if the rocker is firm and tight when switched between on and off --- this one is very lose and finicky. So much so that it takes so little effort to mistakenly switched if off when you are trying to switch it on. Plus the product is so light that it gives you the impression of a cheap material. I wanted to return it but it was past the date of return. The only advantag eof this switch is that it handles a 3 way switch with no issue but i wish it could have been built more solidly.\n10#Item does not match image or description. The dimmers I received are the slim type, no mention of that in desperation. Mounting screws were shown in image, none provided. After reading some less than positive reviews I‚Äôm concerned w/the longevity of the switches. I have purchased other Bestten dimmers and paid more for the deeper design that came with mounting screws and faceplate. I haven‚Äôt had any issues with any of those. Update: found mounting screws in packet of wire nuts. These also seem to be Quite style switches, also no mentioned in description.\n11#Excellent product. Very good product that is easy to install, simple clean packaging and solid value for money.\n12#Essy. Install very standard\n13#Work great. My son bought these for his house and since I am an electrician by trade I was obligated to do the install. I have to say that they were much better than I had first thought. So much so that I bought some for my house. So far so good. I would not hesitate to buy more.\n14#Poor quality, won't last long. You get what you pay for, I guess. 2 stars because all 5 worked but feel very cheap and when they don't have that strong sounding click, you know they will build up carbon deposits on the contactors. Dimmer slide sticks also. If you're a flipper and don't care about long term then these are perfect. But if you're a homeowner, spend the money and get a better switch because every time you turn the lights on or off, you'll wish you bought a better quality switch\n15#Missleading photo. I bought this product because it met the Eletrcrians requirements‚Äîit is UL Listed. The photo and description clearly indicate that it is UL listed. However, the product I received is not. There is no indication on the box or product that it is UL-listed. Not sure why they would be allowed to say something that is that important and not be able to provide that certification.\n16#Good but not perfect. It works pretty good but will not start leds on a low setting.\n17#Not as advertised. The dimmers look great, however they are not good for LED bulbs that do not have at least 100W of power draw (actual load not equivalent). The dimmer is unable to controll the led, it basicly becomes overpriced switch. Very dissapointed. If you looking for good dimmer, Lutron dimmers work great.\n18#Some have issues. 2 of these have issues with the on and off switch. You have to push hard on the top to make the light come on. And also the dimmer is different on the ones that have issues. They dim all the way down to nothing. The others in the pack dim down to about 20% brightness. All these switches are on the same brand and model ceiling can lights.\n19#Garbage. One switch completely failed after installation. Others are connected to a number of LED floods, which together add up to less than 100W, and they flicker whenever there is any surge in the house circuit. I replaced with a Leviton and problem solved.\n20#Not as good as it seems. It was a good deal of getting 5k of these, installed easy, but... switches not working well, sometimes it's delay in turning on, sometimes it's turn on after clicking few times. I'm not satisfied with this purchase.\n21#Stopped working at 1 week, 6 month, longest one lasted 18 months. These are temporary dimmer switches. You will need to replace them. Out of a pack of 4, one of them worked for a week and needed to be replaced, another made it about 6 months, and two of them made it just over a year. Not worth the handyman fees, would not buy these again\n22#Extremely poor quality. Doesn‚Äôt even deserve one star. Bought five pack only needing one. It worked for about two weeks, would turn off fine but had to turn ‚Äúon/off‚Äù multiple times before it would actually turn on. Replaced with another from the pack, after about the same time, the front ‚Äúswitch ‚Äú mechanism cracked and wouldn‚Äôt move.\n23#Beware: wall plates are NOT included... Misinformation in the product description and product pictures: NO wall plates are included. I bought these because I saw \"screwless wall plates included\" in the seller pictures, but mine came with no wall plates whatsoever. Aside from that disappointment, switch is easy to install and works well for me.\n24#Do not buy!!! We bought these dimmers and installed them to only remove all of them that same day. The lights always flickered and there was a buzzing sound they made. Our electrician said they were dangerous and could easily start a fire. Would not recommend and I can‚Äôt return because they are outside the windo.\n25#They are no good. Have to buy a more quality product. The switches will often fail to turn on the light when you flip it... i try to save money everytime I buy stuff online but like the old saying goes by nice or buy twice.\n26#Don't work as intended. Poor quality. These don't work with LED bulbs. To ensure the issue wasn't with the wiring configuration I removed and replaced the dimmer with a normal (non-dimming) switch. The regular switch worked fine. To further troubleshoot I tried another dimmer from the set of 5 purchased--same issue! These are very low quality and should be avoided. Company should be called Worsten, not Bessten.\n27#Light switches. Well I had problems with two switches that didn‚Äôt work the other switches the adjustments wouldn‚Äôt set correctly light if you adjust the light to be dim and turn the light off wait a minute or less and turn it back on it wouldn‚Äôt until you slide the dimmer switch up. I tried to set the preset inside it still wasn‚Äôt working. I also found out the if another light is on the same circuit and you have one on the lights would ticker I had to change all the switches out with new ones.\n28#Quality is not great. Turning on and off is not smooth. Sometimes when it is on min, turning is on doesn't work until you move the button to high light.\n29#CAUTION FIRE HAZARD DON'T BUY. IF YOU HAVE SEND THEM BACK 4 OUT OF 6 FAILED AND STARTED A FIRE ANOTHER HAS SPARKED AND ARCED THEN BLEW OUT CEILING LIGHTS ON 2 SEPARATE CIRCUITS AMAZON STOP SELLING\n30#Work well. Did a great job on being able to tone down some of the lights in our house. Only issue is their color of white. They are slightly off white as compared to the snow white of typical wall plates. Most might not notice but I can see the difference. One note to keep in mind. It may not work well with a fixture that has many bulbs. We have a \"Sputnik\" fixture over our dining room table with 15 bulbs. Goes from full bright to full dim with just a slight move of the slider. Tried another brand dimmer and did the same.\n31#DO NOT PURCHASE. When the dimmer is on the lowest setting the lights don‚Äôt turn on. You need to increase the dimmer for lights to go on. Also when on a lower setting the lights sometimes just randomly go out. They work but you need to mess with them every time you want your lights to turn on. Really annoying bc I used these things all over my house! I don‚Äôt understand why the reviews were so high on this product. I bought 15 of these things and they all have the same exact issue.\n32#No fuss 3-way dimmer. Simple installation instructions, these work in 3way or 4way circuits. These do NOT require a re-wire like some smart dimmers. The switch dims from a single location, all other locations on a 3way or 4way are simple on/off switches. There is a separate rotary adjustment on the switch behind the wall plate for minimum level on the user control slide switch. This setting sets the LED lights to consistently come on and not flicker at a low level. If you are looking for a simple, no fuss dimmer option for your dimmable LED lights without \"smart\" controls, this will work.\n33#Color is Ivory not white. The color is Ivory not white so putting next to other switches and a white face plate looks off. The adjustment wheel to set the dimming level works well. Large ears that stick out on both sides of the device prevent you from installing two next to each other. One has to sit behind the other and thus when installing the cover plate the paddles are at uneven depths. Also, prefer the direct wire-to-side screws rather than the wire nut connection.\n34#Garbage. The dimming function does not work. You get what you pay for.\n35#Dimmer. Does dimmer work well with four LED lights easy hook up\n36#Awful quality. I installed these dimmers in 4 separate switches and encountered soft mushy switches after installing. Some of them wouldn't even turn on/off unless you really \"flicked\" the switch suddenly. They feel terrible and make me worry they could be a fire hazard.\n37#Nice finish. Work well. Dimmer is easy to use\n38#Bad quality control. I purchased 5 pieces, 4 pieces were malfunction after installed, not worth.\n39#Flicker terribly. Unfortunately, despite troubleshooting and adjusting as directed I could not get these to stop flickering. I thought maybe I had a lemon in the package, but I tried a second one and also double checked my wire connections. Still flickered. I ended up reinstalling my old switches and they were fine. Not sure why these didn't work for me but do not recommend at all.\n40#Just ok. After installing about 15 dimmers 4 of them the dimmer slider stop working so had to replace it with new ones\n41#Two Switches Fell Apart. After 8 months of use two of the switches fell apart. The first switch that fell apart was installed for a light that gets turned on maybe 3-4 times a week.\n42#Cause fan motor to buzz. This device cause my fan to buzz. Very annoying\n43#Not what expected. Not very good performance\n44#bought 5, 1 of them has some issue after few weeks. Bought 5, after few weeks, 1 of them has some issues to turn the light on, need to push the toggle hardly to turn the light on it, will replace it\n45#Good dimmers. I have been using these for a few weeks and no issues so far.\n46#Easy peasy! Replacing all the old switches in our house. Takes about 10-15 minutes per switch, I thought I‚Äôd order these to see how they‚Äôd work‚Ä¶‚Ä¶just ordered more.\n47#Broken & Delicate. Delivered as broken and not functional. Do not waste the time and money!\n48#Cheaply made. About 10% of the switches fail. I bought 30 of these for a house rebuild, after fire. About 1 in 10 of the switches was faulty, after I'd paid electricians to install. And some others don't click on and off the first and second time you try. So they are cheaply made and if I had it to do over again I'd spend a bit more for a better product.\n49#So far so good. So far working well, however multiple gang plates don't seem to fit flush with this particular item.",
