Good Dimmer Switch. I have purchased 2 of these and both work well, even with LED lighting. I personally like the rotary style and am glad they are still available. They include different color knobs to suit your needs as well.\n1#Quality switch. So easy to find on Amazon , so difficult to find elsewhere. Installed and working well.\n2#Unable to find this style anywhere. We have multiple dimmer switches on one panel and one of them was not working well...it was 30 years old. I did not want to replace all three as the other two still work great. However, I was unable to find this style in any of the local home improvement stores. I turned to Amazon and there it was! It came with multiple knobs to match the color of the existing ones, and the replacement is almost perfect. This controls multiple recessed LED lights and does so perfectly. No flickering at all!\n3#Rose gold. It did a nice job\n4#Will buy again. Running 9 “LiteHistory Dimmable E26 led Bulb 6W” lamps. No flicker, takes them down to the lowest possible bit of light. Just an awesome product. Will buy again.\n5#Works well. Easy to install, works well. Hard to find in my local stores\n6#Works on LED lights. Works fine on LED lights. We had an older dimmer that was prematurely burning out our LED spots in cans. I told the boss that the dimmer probably was the cause, so we changed it to this dimmer instead. The dimming action is much smoother with the Leviton. The old one used to jump around and get bright and and there was little control over dimming. This dimmer returns fine dimming control and I think it's much easier on the LED lights since it's purposefully designed for CFL and LED lights. I like that this came with three different trim knobs for different colors of ivory, since it's always difficult to match the wall plate color based on a photo. I was able to match the wall plate color perfectly. One criticism, though, the knob sticks out from the wall plate a little more pronounced than the old dimmer did. I think this is caused by the fact this is a \"punch on-off\" design rather than a \"turn clockwise to turn on\" design. The unit can handle SPST, 3 Way and 4 way wiring, too, so it's versatile.\n7#Good guality. Easy to install and works perfectly\n8#Easy to install. Easy to install\n9#Loose knob. The push button switch does not snap on or lock in so it can fall off pretty easily!\n10#Stopped working in a week. Stopped working in a week. Second one.\n11#Works well. It does the job. Great dimmer and comes with several knobs.\n12#Worked. Just what I needed and easy to install\n13#Just what we needed. Simple to install. Works great!\n14#Good product. Works well with LED bulbs.\n15#Perfect for 3 way application. Very easy to install....just match the colored wires on the dimmer to the ones in the box.\n16#No flicker with LED. Works perfectly with Cree dimmable led bulbs. No flickers.\n17#Ignore the negative reviews. Easy installation. Works perfectly.\n18#DiY electrical, I got this. No one died and the house didn’t burn down.\n19#LED dimming without the flickering. LED lights don’t flicker!. 2 or 3 way application\n20#Easy to install. Easy to install Works good Yeaaa me\n21#Works great. Does what its supposed to do. Installed easily in 70's home with old wiring. Dims and no buzzing with LEDs.\n22#Good product, great price. Used these to update older incandescent-era dimmers. Working great with dimmable LED bulbs. The locator light is a neat feature.\n23#Simple to install and Dims my LED's. I wanted a simple dimming control for my LED lighting. This worked perfectly (better than a slide dimmer).\n24#The dimmer knob does not fit older RDL06-10Z models with circular posts. This is D shaped. After obtaining the model number for our 30-year old dimmer from Leviton, we bought this same model hoping we could use just the knob to replace our broken knob without paying an electrician to change the entire unit. Our old knob's post requires an open circle shape, and this newer model's post hole is D shaped.\n25#Great product and good price. Replacement for defective dimmer. Good product, right price.\n26#Works well. Good for the price\n27#Works Well, Good Price, Good Instructions. My dimmer broke after 28 years and I have never replaced a switch before. It was easy with good instructions and only took less than 30 minutes and works great and only cost 14 bucks, probably saving me over 200 if I had hired someone.\n28#It Lite Up Bright. It Worked Like A Charm\n29#Woeks perfect with dimmable Led bulb. I had a standard bulb to replace with a Led. I used a non dimmable Led bulb and it failed in a week so I replaced the Led bulb and switch with this dimmable option and works perfect.\n30#Easy to operate and fits standard switch plate. A rotary dimmer, in my professional opinion, is the easiest to operate. Many dimmers require you to push, slide, hold, and generally make love to it to operate your lights. The rotary is quick and easy to operate. Another advantage is that it uses a standard, old-fashioned switch plate, as opposed to a Decora-style plate with the large rectangular opening. This may not be big deal, until you start putting multiple switches at one location. A three-gang switch box, for instance, where you have a combination of standard toggle switches and dimmers can be hard to find a plate with the configuration you need. Keep it simple. We only buy universal application, like this dimmer, because it does all types of bulbs and is either single or three-way. Can't beat it for simplicity and ease of customer use.\n31#Works OK but not great. I used it for a BR40 65 Watt dimmable LED bulb. Although it works, it is poor are the lower levels of light and never can take the intensity to zero. It always stays lite at a dim level and when you turn the knob up it kind of flickers unit partially turned up. It appears the design still cannot eliminate the leakage to shut the bulb off completely. May because it is not designed just for LED's but tries to do both LED & Incandescence bulbs. Please design one for LED's only and maybe it would work better.\n32#Works well - hoping for longevity. This replaced the old 6683 version - just installed and works as expected. Needed the -10Z (which can be wired as a single switch or as a 3-way). I needed 3-way because of the switch across the room that turns the light on and off as well. I followed the wiring instructions - good to go. Hoping for longevity - time will tell.\n33#Doesn't dim all the way. We're using it to dim LED's around the bathroom mirror. This won't dim them over the full range....it stops dimming when the lights are still plenty bright. I'm an engineer so of course I know everything ;) Seriously, I've designed light dimmers and motor speed controls many times and I know exactly what is wrong with the design. These should be designed with a tiny microprocessor which checks the current through the wires periodically and calibrates the half-cycle ramp. If Leviton wants to pay me, I'll design one that does that. It wouldn't add but a few cents to the cost.\n34#Works Great - Easy to Install. This switch was easy to install and came as advertised with two different buttons. We used it to replace one that looked just like it in a 3-way installation and it works well. It does hum a bit when dimmed to 50% or less but it is only noticeable if your standing right next to it.\n35#Does the job. Does the job. Better since it has a push button on/off\n36#Not for LED use! This switch is NOT for LED use. I bought this switch for use with LED's, hooked it up and it buzzes loudly and doesn't adjust properly.\n37#Perfect Product!!! The Rotary Dimmer Switch is PERFECT!!!! I am so very happy that you had it and that you messaged me when it was in stock. Also, it arrived safely at the Post Office. Thanks so very much.",
