Excellent service and product quality. A+\n1#Easy to install and did what we wanted. So far good. Pleased with the purchase\n2#Awesome system - easy to install and to integrate into your smart home. I have updated several rooms to the Caseta Smart Lighting system and love it. It is easy to setup and use. Even better, it is easy to integrate it with other smart home tools such as Home Assistant. The only regret I have is that I should have done it sooner. You will not regret it.\n3#Stopped Working a few days ago. Will try to call customer support tomorrow. Disappointed as I have other switches that work well from this company..\n4#Great Wireless Switches. I installed two of these switches and love them. Just ordered another one for the new recessed LED lighting that I just finished installing in the kitchen. If you can change a light bulb, you can install one of these switches. The switches come with very easily understandable instructions. Just be sure to turn off the required circuit breaker before starting.\n5#Description says it includes \"Caseta plug-in lamp dimmer\" but that was not included. What can I say, didn't get what I was promised.\n6#Great switch with lots of options. This is a very nice dimmer with the ability to create lighting scenes and schedules from your smart phone. Very easy installation as well.\n7#Very good, very expensive. Would buy again, but they are pricy\n8#Great multi-control point dimmer. Fantastic to install a dimmer switch that includes a wall-mountable remote dimmer that requires no additional wiring. As easy to install as any other switch and simple to connect and configure the bridge. Have since installed multiple other Caseta switches and integrated them easily.\n9#Awesome Lighting Control Dimmer. The Lutron Caséta Wireless Smart Dimmer has completely transformed the way I control my home lighting. This smart dimmer has proven to be a reliable and convenient addition to my smart home setup, providing seamless control and enhancing the ambiance of my living spaces. Installation was a breeze. The included instructions were clear and straightforward, making the setup process quick and hassle-free. I was able to replace my existing dimmer switch with the Lutron Caséta Smart Dimmer in no time. The smart dimmer is compatible with various light bulbs, including dimmable LEDs, incandescent, and halogen bulbs. It adapts effortlessly to different lighting fixtures, ensuring smooth dimming performance without any flickering or buzzing. The wireless control capability is a game-changer. I can use the Lutron app on my smartphone to adjust the brightness of my lights remotely. Whether I'm away from home or just relaxing on the couch, I have full control over the lighting ambiance with a simple tap on my phone. The smart dimmer is also compatible with voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. I love the convenience of using voice commands to dim or brighten the lights, creating a hands-free and futuristic experience. The \"smart away\" feature is a valuable addition. It randomly turns the lights on and off when I'm away, giving the impression that someone is home and enhancing security. The geofencing feature is brilliant. It automatically turns on the lights when I arrive home and turns them off when I leave, further optimizing energy usage. The smart dimmer's customizable schedules allow me to create personalized lighting scenes for various occasions. I can set different brightness levels for morning, evening, and bedtime, creating the perfect atmosphere for every moment. The Smart Bridge that comes with the Lutron Caséta Smart Dimmer acts as the central hub for all my Lutron devices, ensuring smooth and reliable communication between them. In conclusion, the Lutron Caséta Wireless Smart Dimmer is a must-have for anyone looking to elevate their home lighting control. Its seamless integration with smart home ecosystems, wireless control capabilities, and customizable features make it a powerful and versatile smart dimmer. If you desire effortless control over your home lighting and want to create the perfect ambiance for every occasion, I highly recommend the Lutron Caséta Wireless Smart Dimmer. Embrace the convenience of smart lighting and take your home's ambiance to the next level with this impressive smart dimmer.\n10#Expensive but worth it. Our church remodel doesn't have a common at the switches so these Lutron's were required for automation. Wired up the porch light specifically to use the Dawn to Dusk program. Wired the chapel lights to separate switches for East & West walls, ceilings, and foyer. We programed them all for Away mode while we traveled to New Zealand and Australia for three weeks. Our friends and neighbors never knew we were out of town. Controlling individual switches from my phone is great... Even when away. I bought two kits that included a hub so there would be a spare. Hub works great. Happy the frequency is not on the wifi. Haven't upgraded switches upstairs yet so can't say how the hub will perform through floors. All our bulbs are LED with at least two per circuit and they all work great including the dimming feature.\n11#super easy to install & works well. This has the ability to add Ring to it so when the door bell picks up motion or someone rings the doorbell it fires this light for 15min then defaults to off. It also only comes on at night. All these options are toggle on/off so it very self explanatory. They are not the cheapest out there buy they work well. I will be getting more.\n12#Great product. I was very pleased with my purchase of the Lutron Caséta Wireless Smart Lighting Dimmer Switch Starter Kit. It was extremely easy to install and almost automatically linked with my Apple HomeKit app after setting it up on the Lutron app. Will be looking for more products from Lutron as I build my smart home devices.\n13#Works as expected. Expensive, but works as expected. good material good quality.\n14#Works great, easy install, love the remote. While I had an electrician install the switch itself, setting it up was a breeze! I plugged the hub in and ran through the setup in the app. Everything went without a hitch. I have a 100 year old house, so this \"no neutral\" switch works perfectly for me, and having the remote means I can operate the lights from the other entryway to my dining room by mounting it on the wall. (That is if I decide not to use Alexa!)\n15#Dimmer won't remember last dimmer setting. Wifi integration is flawless and haven't had any issues with switch. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a switch that remembers last dimmer setting, this device will only switch back to full setting. The only way around this is to setup through the favorite button on the pico remote, or setup a scene, custom name it, and voice command the name to Alexa. Not sure why Lutron decided to set it up this way, but all other dimmers will remember last setting (including equivalent Leviton offerings). Contemplating switching to Leviton just because of this.\n16#Works Terrific with Smartthings. Integrates well with Smartthings... it was very easy to install and is very responsive with Smartthings & Alexa. I previously had these running through Wink without the Smart Bridge, and response time was generally slow and less reliable.\n17#ALL SWITCHES PROFESSIONALLY INSTALLED THEN FAILED. Google search confirmed that this is a common occurrence- these switches fail. Unfortunately I cannot return them as it is two weeks too late\n18#light works well, pico remote not. I just bought this dimmer with remote included. The light was relatively easy to install. I installed the app on my phone as well as the bridge at home on my desk (room where I have the dimmer). The pico remote is working only 35-40% of the time. Lots of time, when the lights are off and you wish to turn them on, when I press the pico remote to turn them on, nothing happen. I see the small LED on the side of the dimmer switch on the wall going up to say it is on, and in the Lutron app, it says the lights are on, but in reality, lights are off. The only way to turn the lights on is to go to the wall switch and turn on from there which defy the purpose of a remote. Don't know if it has interferences with my computer system on the desk but the remote is useless. Loss of money.\n19#Perfect set. Perfect set\n20#Flimsy buttons; does not share a box well. This is what happens when you don’t have any HomeKit competition in the light switch space. I can’t fault Lutron’s tech here. The switches connect and work flawlessly. But, wow, I have never seen such flimsy, wobbly, squishy button gear on a wall plate. If I hadn’t noticed this “characteristic” on so many video reviews, I’d be wondering if my unit was broken. It’s not like they didn’t have room to include something better. The switch case barely leaves room inside a standard 2-gang box for wiring, much less a companion GFCI plug.\n21#Awesome Upgrade for Lighting. Simply awesome - easy install and works seamlessly\n22#Reliable. Reliable switch for older house electrical cabling. I have observed it is normally OFF if main power switch is turn OFF and ON again.\n23#For the price, you're basically getting the hub and remote for free by purchasing this kit. I am absolutely loving the caseta integration in my home. This product specifically gets 5 stars in my opinion because the caseta dimmer elswhere is about $60. With this kit you get the dimmer and remote that by themselves work independently from the caseta app. The wireless hub is included in this kit and if used allows you to control the lights from anywhere in the world via the app. The user interface is simple to setup and easy to use. This allows you to setup schedules, scenes and events. It also allows the light switch to be integrated with alexa, the ring doorbell and a handful of other thermostats. I have 6 other caseta switches on the hub with no connection issues what so ever. Another great feature of the caseta dimmer is that it also acts as a signal repeater for the hub. Lutron sells a repeater as well if you're having connection issues due to distance.\n24#Lo recomiendo a otros clientes, le va a gustar muchísimo. Interruptor de muy buena calidad y de fácil instalación.\n25#Very Nice. The LUTRON brand is a bit pricey but well worth the money. It’s a product that just works. Never had an issue with any of their products.\n26#Just works great on my switch with only two wires. It seems that this is the only working option for those with old switches that doesn't have a neutral. I used a self tapping screw in the metal junction box and ran the ground wire to it. I used it to replace my C by GE which was plagued with issues. I only dock one star as the C by GE had less buttons but a much better switch interface that allowed you to turn on the light to the brightest, lowest or last setting depending on which of the big and easily visible buttons. There are 4 buttons on the Lutron and you only have the option to turn on the brightest or lowest settings. Only the Pico remote with 5 buttons allow you to return to a preset setting. There is no reason for a separate on and off button in my opinion.\n27#Coolest light switches around. Pretty cool that I can finally ask Alexa to dim the lights and stuff. I have 4 dimmers connected. I like that when you turn off a light it fades down. May not be perfectly compatible with all dimmable lights. I have one that blinks before turning on, I may change the bulbs and see what my options are, but otherwise they work well.\n28#Fully integrated and easy to install. I have a mix of traditional Maestro Lutron switches when we remodeled our home some 20 years ago. Over the years, the Lutron switch mechanism started failing so has been looking for a replacement. Few years ago started switching some of the switches to GE Zwave switches and integrated them with Samsung SmartThings and/or ADT Pulse; and added them to Alexa via SmartThings integration. I am now planning to replace the legacy Maestro switches to a new smart switch technology and also replace the GE Zwave siwtches as well. I considered various WIFI based switches, but ended up settling on Lutron Caseta technology because WIFI switches were a pain and not very responsive. Almost all other smart switches needed a neutral switch and most of them didn't support SmartThings, Apple Homekit, etc. I was looking for a technology that could work with all major smart hubs and wouldn't require a neutral wire. Lutron Caseta works great. The price is high, but it works like a charm. I just received my Lutron Caseta hub+dimmer+pico and took me a total of 15 minutes to install the dimmer and configure the Lutron IOS App. I added the new devices to Lutron, linked to my SmartThings and scanned the AppleKit label and everything got added automatically to my existing room grouping. But Lutron Caseta pricing is just too expensive considering the upcoming technology which is a major downside.\n29#Excellent product. Excellent product\n30#Terrible software and install experience. So, I bought kit with the smart bridge in March of this year, and it is now amost 9 months later and I still don't have the smart bridge working. I have installed 2 light switches, which work fine, but all the Homekit integration is nonfunctional for me. The install experience via the iOS Lutron app is probably the worst I have ever experienced for ANY smart home or internet connected device, showing me countless errors (the attached screenshot is just one of them) and providing zero real guidance on how to resolve any of them. The hardware product -- the actual switches and their pico remotes -- may be good, but until Lutron solves the software problems, and improves the install experience for the bridge, I would stay away from this product.\n31#The Caseta bridge WILL work with a network switch. I bought this switch for our ceiling fan light and another Caseta switch for the ceiling fan itself. The fans are located on our back patio and we hardly use them so we don’t use the switches too often. However, I got them so that I could turn on the fan/light from anywhere (more so for when we are outside and I don’t want to go inside to hit the switch). The app responds quickly and it is a great alternative to having remote controls for every switch in the house. Instead, it’s all in one app in one place. Also, I set up our Alexa to control these which is a neat feature. Side note on the included bridge: The instructions say to plug this directly into the router. I have a network switch and have this bridge plugged into the switch, which then is routed to my wireless router. I have had zero problems so it appears being plugged into the switch is just fine. (See photo)\n32#All around great: great app, great customer service. This is awesome! I have wanted to install a “smart light switch” in my house for years. But my house is old and the wiring is old, as well. So when I found this, I was really excited. I had a small hiccup when I was doing the installation and the customer service was awesome. The app is easy to use, the remote is a great feature. It works great with Alexa and I feel like I have a lot of control with the dimming. I bought some great led light bulbs on here that have worked great. Don’t hesitate, this is great!\n33#Easy intergration. Previously had a WINK system and decided not to pay the monthly fee when they converted from Fee to Fee. Once I understood that I had to reset my existing Caseta switches it was easy to pair them to the hub. Also, integrating the switches to ALEXA was a breeze.\n34#Just make sure you want Caseta. I now have 2 Caseta Bridges in our house (one in the house and one in the garage to deal with exterior lights). The \"repeaters\" have limited range and were not enough. I had internet near the garage so we just installed a 2nd bridge. Thus far the entire system has worked well. Just make sure you want Caseta and not the Radio RA or RA2 systems . I started with Caseta because that's what I saw in the local hardware store and it wasn't until I was well into this system that I leared more about alternative \"higher end\" Lutron systems. With that said. I've been pleased with the Caseta system as a whole as it currently meets my needs. Unclear if I would have gone RadioRA2 or Caseta if I learned about them at the same time.\n35#Responsive and reliable. Great solution for Smart lighting without having to change all the bulbs or remove the convenience of a switch. The dimmer is clean and responsive. It’s expensive. But the cost is worth it.\n36#Works Great! Easy to install. Works great with Google Assistant.\n37#Solid no muss no fuss makes my wife happy. Works correctly all the time. Some of the other smart home devices that have their own WiFi config have been flakey. This is solid and works. My only complaint is it’s kind of pricey. Replacing each switch in the house is a significant cost, beyond this starter kit. But it does make wife happy that you never have restart or reset it, and you can control the light with Alexa or automation, AND the wall switch.\n38#Perfect addition to a non-smart home. This product was great for my apartment. I don't have a lot of smart home devices so I was a little nervous with this. But the set up is really easy and it allows me to use my bulbs to their full capacity, not just on or off. I like that you can set your lights to come on and go off at scheduled times.\n39#Highly Recommend. After watching the reviews on You Tube I went ahead and purchased the Lutron Caseta Wirless light switch. The install was very easy and the programming was even easier. I would highly recommend this light switch for your home. I am in the process of changing out all my switches over to the Lutron Caseta. Nice job Lutron\n40#Complete package for Alexa integration. Great dimmer, easy to instal and includes the hub. This is identical to the switch plus remote package that has good reviews and that I also like. This one comes with the hub needed to make Alexa integration work. 5 starts works perfectly. The dimming range adjustment plus no neutral needed plus Alexa plus optional remotes? This is the best dimmer switch. It’s also pricy but over time I plan to replace all my dimmers with this one\n41#Works great. Works well with Alexa. I’m very happy with this product.\n42#Great Product. Horrible Experience. Lutron’s products overall, and Caseta especially, are great products. They work great and solve many problems, as well as provide functionality beyond most comparable products. This experience however was not great. I ordered for a planned installation this week. Item came in an envelope without sufficient packaging. The item was sold as new. The item was obviously used and not reconditioned. The item was not repackaged properly. The dimmer and plate were scratched and sticky. I didn’t even test for functionality. The physical condition of the product alone rendered it useless to me.\n43#First electrical project and we’re all still alive! Needed a setup for a living room light fixture that would connect into an old 2 wire setup, but yet was Smartified and this did the trick. Good news, this Was my first official electrical project, including mounting and connecting this to the Edison light fixture to which this controls - and, didn’t burn the complex down or get jolted with electricity! Go team! Seriously though, it’s pretty simple and super effective. Thanks\n44#GREAT Google Assistant Integration. I have lights in the house that can't be simply replaced with smart bulbs. I simply replaced the standard light switch with the Caseta switch and Hub. Adding additional switches was just as easy. All in all, the value of the switch to control multiple lights is great. Integrates well with Google Assistant, which is my smart home assistant of choice.\n45#Great for old house that has 2 wires for the light switch. Easy to install. The hub needs about 10 min to do app update. Works like a charm\n46#Great. Great product. Little expensive, but that is to be expected with Lutron. Excellent quality\n47#Lutron. Best home kit out there\n48#Awesome Smart Home Tech. Installation: Installation was a breeze for the most part, however for working with a 3way implementation the directions did not come with this packaging and I did have to get on Lutron website to find them. Found that the directions were vastly similar, but not identical, to the majestro product line which these Caseta switches were replacing. Also NO COMMON WIRE NEEDED, oh this is so nice for a smart switch product line! Lutron, I tip my hat to you! Bravo!!! General Impression: After trying several brands and having mixed to horrible results I decided to try the Lutron Caseta line. Well now my house is filled with the line. Absolutely wonderful product line with awesome Alexa integration. The integration was seamless once enabling the skill via the Alexa app. I do recommend this system. Since the installation it has been ROCK SOLID. No major issues with firmware upgrade, there has been zero lost connectivity issues and/or switches not responding. The product is absolutely prime time ready unlike so many of the competitors out there. Initially I was on the fence against having another smart home product that required a hub but at the same time this tech isn't impeding on my WIFI coverage and also has a very surprising range in my 2,200 sq ft home. The hub itself is sleek and looks nice sitting my shelf o tech things. I Cannot Break It: I've done rigorous testing with the product trying to cause a failure and have had no issues. Testing has including loss of power and ETH connection several times over. It always comes back online. The only thing that I can kinda gripe but not really, is the time the hub takes to come back online with the app when power is hard lost. It can be upwards of 5 minutes, but all in all. That is the only thing I can truly find wrong with the hub. Compared to previous experiences with other vendors this is by far the most well construed smart switch ecosystem I've ever had the joy of playing with. The App: The App is very well designed and works perfectly. It easy to add custom schedules and the switches to the hub via the app. Overall a 5 star experience there. Other competitors have some of the most awful apps that I've ever used. However Lutron has set the bar! It is fast, it is responsive and most importantly it is STABLE! Wish List! The only thing that I would want out of the product line is an all in one fan/light smart switch. This type of switch is truly lacking from the smart switch market and living in the southern states of the United States there are ceiling fans in all rooms. This is my last great hurdle for an all in one smart switch ecosystem. Currently this product line, as of 08/23/2019, does offer a fan control switch but it does not control the light. You have to have a dual gang box and install two switches, one for the fan and one for the light. This is less than ideal for my situation. Overall I highly recommend this product line, it has been headache and frustration free since installing and I've been adding to the lutron ecosystem gradually and now have 8 switches working like a smart home dream come true.\n49#Absolute garbage, will never work with App unless. I am in tech and not only is it hard to get it to connect, it is even harder when you change the network.. also need to be hardwired straight to the router and since we use mostly wifi, the routers genreally have one port which in my case i had for google router.. Lutron does not know how to recognize Google wifi even if you provide the IP.. better to get wifi enabled lights than this..",
