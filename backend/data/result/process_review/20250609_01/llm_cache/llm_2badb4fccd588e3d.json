Awesome thanks\n1#Light leaks out from the side of the switch. This switch works fine but I won't buy this brand again. As you can see from the photo, light leaks out from around the switch. It looks sloppy. Only the paddle should be illuminated, not the gaps around it. The light on this switch is only meant to be a locater in a dark room. It is not a night light. Some people have unfairly marked it down for that reason. If you are looking for a night light, get something that plugs into an outlet.\n2#great LED lighted switch. This is illuminated when the switch is off, exactly what I was looking for. A little spendy but it works, unlike a lot of the cheaper ones.\n3#Just as advertised. East installation, color as advertised.\n4#Works as advertised.... Installed a pair side by side. One for a ceiling fan, and the other for the LED lights in the ceiling fan. Both work very well. Installation was about as easy as could be expected for a 26 year old house where the wires had plenty of time to lock into their current position. For clarification, the switch also has a ground terminal. The illustration provided at the Amazon.com site doesn't show this.\n5#Good quality. Works well - nothing to dislike\n6#Works perfectly. Be careful to select the specific model required for LED. The Incandescent version is different.\n7#Love the light built in. My husband is so happy with this item. He hates trying to find the wall light at night and this fixed his complaints lol.\n8#Not a night light. I bought this thinking it would be similar to light switches I have seen in hotels. The switch works just fine but the light is very dim.\n9#Great switch but hard to install. You need to know if your circuit is three way or not. If you have two switches for one light you’ll need this three way switch. Had to call my electrician friend to figure out which side (master or slave) to install it. Motion sensor works well except for an occasional coming on with no movement (unless we have a ghost). If you’re a novice and every thing in this review is confusing you’ll need a little help from someone that knows what they are doing. Even with help it took 45 minutes.\n10#Not bright enough. This illuminated switch has only enough light to find the switch. See photo. Not bright enough to see your way into the room. Will be returning it since I was looking for more of a night light.\n11#As expected. Worked as expected\n12#The one I got had defectively low illumination. The one I got had defectively low illumination.\n13#light is not as bright. Nothing wrong, but light is not as bright as previous similar Leviton switches I have ordered. It is being returned because I ordered the wrong color anyway. The instructions were missing, the box is \"blank\", no model number, not even a product description. Probably a returned item. BUYER BEWARE!!\n14#Great switch with good internal light but you can't buy white? The headline says it all. Great switch with good internal light but you can't buy white?\n15#QUALITY. GREAT PRODUCT.\n16#Nice White Light Glow on the Rocker Switch. I like the solid white light on the rocker switch instead of the old orange flickering glow. Gives it a clean modern look. Easy to install. On the downside, it is quieter than the old switch's \"click\" but it is not totally silent. Took 12 days to arrive. Easy to install and I am satisfied with it as it does what it is suppose to do and looks good.",
