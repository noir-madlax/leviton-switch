The dimmer really adds to the ambiance of the kitchen lighting\n1#High wattage dimmer. We have a chandelier with 15 dimmable bulbs that together exceed the wattage of a lower price dimmer. This switch did the job. Easy to install and easy to use.\n2#Dimmer Flickers. I have 204W of LED lighting in my kitchen and wanted my wife to be able to dim when she wanted. I first purchased a Leviton 3-way dimmer switch from Home Depot with a rated capacity of 300W. That unit caused my lights to flicker. Then I purchased this Lutron Dimmer with a capacity of 250W hoping that the dimming feature would work better. The installation was easy but the lights continue to flicker, not continually, but occasionally. Other rooms that have dimmers but a fewer number of LED tubes and lower load do not flicker...so I must assume the cause is the dimmer unit. I would not recommend purchasing this unit.\n3#Worked great with our LED bulbs. We had another Lutron dimmer that would cause the lights to flicker (once we swapped out the incandesent bulbs for LED bulbs). This new LED dimmer works great, and we the lights no longer flicker. I like how the lower end of the dimmer cycle can be adjusted as well, allowing you to set the brightness of the lights at the lowest setting.\n4#Wrong Switch. The box had clearly been opened and contained the wrong switch. The switch inside was a TGCL-153P\n5#Good deal. Excellent dimmers for led lights\n6#Higher quality than competition. Solved problem with competition switch that was replaced (buzzing, heat).\n7#No hum/whine! I installed 12 Aspect LED ultra-thin in my basement several years back when finishing it into a home office. I purchased an 'approved' dimmer from Aspect LED at the time and have spent years annoyed with the horrible screeching whine that it made every time it was dimmed. In late 2019 I finally decided to do something about it. I tried ordering a new dimmer of the same type but it was defective and wouldn't dim. I tried a different brand and its hum was half as loud, but present even when at full intensity. I tried another one and it hummed louder than the first. After five failed attempts with five different switch models I was getting extremely frustrated, and decided to give it one more attempt; this time with a more expensive dimmer. This Lutron was 2x the price of my others, but ended up being worth every penny. It does not whine when at full. It does not whine when dimmed. And I am enjoying finally having my sanity back. It would have been worth 10x that price just to have the whine gone. So for that, I wanted to give this 5 stars. However, I have to take a star away for the fact that flipping the switch to on does not turn on my lights. Sometimes after a second or two they will begin to softly pulse (about once per second). However, to get the lights actually on I need to turn the dimmer to low, flip the switch on, and then turn the dimmer to full. I'm relatively sure the switch is wired correctly; even sent a photo to an electrician for a quick verification. I tried reseating all the wires and reconnecting; nothing helped. I even switched it out for the old dimmer just to verify nothing broke during the install, but the old dimmer worked perfect (though with a whine). No other dimmer switch had this problem. In the end I decided that a little annoyance when I turn it on each day is worth not having a high pitched whine constantly eating away at my sanity for 12+ hours every work day and kept it.\n8#Great dimmer. Easy to install. I’m a big fan of these dimmers because they fit right into a normal switch spot. I used this dimmer to dim 6 LED drivers for outdoor eave lights. These lights have a separate driver that controls the light so I needed this specific switch and it turned out to work great. I was so happy with this dimmer that I ordered another one for my back patio lights and if I end up wanting to dim some of my lights indoors I will probably use the same dimmer. My only gripe was that I ordered an amazon warehouse deal and the switch they sent me had paint on it and did not work right out of the box. I returned that switch and ordered a brand new one which worked out great. Great dimmer with clear instructions on how to wire it up.\n9#Good. As described. Dims down to zero.\n10#Five Stars. great help desk,quick ship,pricing ok\n11#A fine high capacity dimmer. Exactly as described, can handle large loads and has excellent dimming capability. Does not emit hardly any noise. I wish it was a little less expensive though.\n12#Works but I ordered the wrong color. I purchased white and should have ordered ivory. My bad. It works, but I'll have to replace it at some point or move it to an area where the color is not an issue.\n13#Disappointed. I got 180W on a switch and it ... UL rated 250W, performance verified 150W. Disappointed. I got 180W on a switch and it won't work properly.\n14#It features a good range of dimming that is adjustable. Replaced the old dimmer switches with these inorder to use dimmable LED bulbs. It features a good range of dimming that is adjustable\n15#Five Stars. Works great with multiple LEDs!\n16#Works great. Exactly what I needed\n17#Perfect Dimmer for Lots of LEDs. Perfect. Especially like the fine-tuning dimming adjustment. I replaced 14 BR30 incandescent 65w bulbs in my great room and was using a 1000w Lutron dimmer for them. With the lower power demand of the LEDs, them would not dim low enough (too much power being sent through even at lowest setting). This dimmer is perfect and was able to adjust the fine-tuning dimmer so that the external dimmer slide would make the lights very dim. Highly recommend!\n18#One Star. Junk, Failed after one day!!!!\n19#Five Stars. Great device can't go wrong with the quality\n20#too much. overpriced go to Menards it's cheaper\n21#Works as advertised. Appears to be of higher quality ... Works as advertised. Appears to be of higher quality than the generic CFL/LED dimmer it replaced. Be sure to use it with one of the bulbs displayed in Lutron's compatibility chart, or you will violate the unit's warranty. I'm running 13 Philips LED lights with it, and it works very well.\n22#Works great with LED lights. Great Dimmer, I use with six 19W 6-inch LED lights from TORCHSTAR\n23#Dims and adjusts well, runs cool, works great with LEDs as referenced. Works as described, silent and perfectly, no flicker.\n24#works great with 36-watt of LED's. Works great with six 6-watt LEDs. Can be adjusted to dim down all the way without flickering. On another circuit with only one 6-watt Led it cannot dim down all the way., but works fine for my purpose.",
