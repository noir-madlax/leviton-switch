Love it! You need to have this if you have a smart home if the wifi goes out you can still control your lights. Super easy to setup and use. I have had it for a year and it works the same!\n1#Endless issues with this whole system. Endless issues, too many things to list here, would highly recommend going elsewhere\n2#Drains battery. Battery does not last more than a few weeks. Not practical\n3#An awesome piece of tech. This Philips hue remote control is very customizable through the Philips hue app. In order to use it with your Philips hue light it is required to have a Philips hue bridge. The material is very premium and very responsive.\n4#Easy switch for my set up. Works perfectly with all the hue lights I have installed already.\n5#Very happy with the remote switch. I started converting my house to a smart house to fulfill my itch to tinker. My wife, on the other hand, was not that thrilled about having to use a voice assistant or her phone to control the lights. That's where these bad boys come in handy. The switches worked super well with home assistant and I was able to configure them to work the lights in the various rooms so that she can just use the remote and be happy. It has worked wonders! Very happy.\n6#Exactly what I needed. Exactly what I needed. I love that I can program multiple scenes or just dim the one I’m on\n7#Maybe received a fake? The face buttons on the unit I received are upside down. You can see it compared to one I purchased about a year ago. Very weird!\n8#Great addition to the hue lighting system. This remote works great and is quite convenient to use with the hue light system when you don't want to bother with the app. Keeping the remote in the holder makes it into a dimming light switch that you can keep on the wall. It synced easily and can be set to work with multiple lights.\n9#Needs batteries and hard wiring. Magnet is terrible. Love the Hue Lights. Hate their switch infrastructure. Why they refuse to allow or certify lights that actually work with your existing home wiring is beyond me. I tried this one for a while and it does control the Hue lights but you need to hardwire the circuit on. Also the magnet is crap. In our Kitchen the \"remote\" keeps getting bumped and knocked out of the cradle. And it needs batteries. I have recently gone with Inovelli Smart Dimmers to control my Hue lights and my \"dumb\" bulbs in Chandeliers.\n10#Spend your money on something cheaper and more reliable. Do not buy!!! Horrible customer service (that was sent overseas). I have around 48 lights. The bridge stopped working and I called to troubleshoot. The Tech support person literally read word for word from their website to troubleshoot. I told them that I already tried their suggestions and they didn’t work. The person on the phone we needed to try again. In the end I hung up. It’s sad that I spent all this money on their lights and now their tech support team can’t even get them working.\n11#Helpful. These are going to be very helpful when my mom dog sits, she does not have access to the APP while we are gone. It controls 2 lights in each room and allows to fade the lights. It took me a bit to figure out, you have to go throught the Hue Phillips App on phone, but once done it works through the WIFI.\n12#Excellent product. Works well with Hue, not so great with Amazon Alexa.\n13#Reliable. This item is easy to set up and works very well.\n14#A must buy if want a physical on off switch. It’s very easy to use and would recommend if someone what’s to have an analog on off instead of using the Hue App. It’s very intuitive and I can control the brightness, turn on and off and also switch between the hue scenes. It’s very responsive and its fast. You dim the lights, increase the brightness. Overall very well product.\n15#Must Have Home Device. programmable for a ton of different combinations, this is essential for anybody using the Philips Hué bulbs in their home. Fast button response, easy to turn on and turn off, and the dimmer up/down switches are super useful.\n16#Excellent product work as designed. Excellent product work as designed. 5 stars if it were easier to integrate with the app\n17#Batteries DOA. Tabs were pulled from the batteries already when I opened the package, then when trying to pair them with hue I received a dead battery signal and now have to go buy some 2032 batteries for the two switches I bought. Very frustrating.\n18#Great convenient switches you can take with you. Excellent substitution for light switches with a Hue system. I bought two one for upstairs and one for downstairs. Super customizable and useful if you misplace your phone or it dies. Dimmer switch makes it even better.\n19#great add on.. works like a charm. no issues connecting up, great add on.. works like a charm.\n20#\"Transform Your Space with the Philips Hue Dimmer Switch – A Game Changer!\". I absolutely love the Philips Hue Dimmer Switch! It’s sleek, intuitive, and a total game-changer for smart lighting. The setup was a breeze and literally took just a few minutes, no complicated wiring. The responsiveness is flawless, and I can effortlessly adjust the lighting to set the perfect mood, whether I want cozy ambiance or bright, energizing light. One of my favorite features is the ability to control multiple lights at once with a single click, and the custom preset options are a dream, perfect for any activity, from reading to movie nights. Plus, the switch is battery-powered, so there’s no need to worry about complicated installations or power outlets. If you’re looking to enhance your Philips Hue experience, this dimmer switch is an absolute must-have!\n21#Works without a bridge! Thought it might be helpful to clarify two points that confused me about this listing. Firstly, there is another (more expensive) listing that makes it look like there is another version of this device (dimmer switch) that does work without a Hue bridge while this one must be used with a bridge. Both of these are untrue. I can attest that this device can indeed control Hue lights directly via bluetooth. The control might be a bit more limiting than with the bridge, but I haven't found it to be a problem at all. Additionally, from my research, there is only one version of this device so you might as well buy it off the cheaper listing. The Philips documentation could definitely be better as to pairing without a bridge, but I think most people will be able to get there. Once paired, I've been quite pleased with the set in operation.\n22#I like the concept but the software needs inprovment. I really like the Phillips HUE products and this switch, but it is hard to setup with the HUE software. The software has some bugs where I wasn't able to save my settings due to an error. Also, it seems to only remember the default light settings where I'm not able to program my custom color settings that are in the HUE software. If it does allow this, it is just hard to get it to work. Again, having the switch is great, I just with Phillips would debug there software, plus make it easier to program the themes easier.\n23#Works Great for Alexa! As long as you have the job, this works great for Alexa, when when using other bulbs! It would be nice to have double presses, and I wish Alexa routines would allow for lowering and raising brightness by a certain amount instead of changing to a set amount, one of which I hope Philips sees as feedback and changes and the other I hope for Amazon to see. That small critique aside, it's great to have a generic switch that can be used for anything! I'm not a big fan of having to have a hub, but of all hubs to get Philips Hue is probably the most well-known to go for anyway. 10/10 recommend this product for triggering Alexa Routines using matter!\n24#Not an Improvement. I have several of the older style hue dimmers.. one started alerting for a quickly dying battery even after changing batteries and even brands. But the bullet and purchased new.. This product is horrible, for starts I couldn’t get the back off, husband finally got a large screwdriver but damage to the plastic from the companies (use a quarter) directions did not work. Got it set up but now the consumer is being forced to use the Hue ugly oversized plate. Photos show how my older version hung nicely on my plate that I had magnetized. This one has something internally which is causing it to repel the magnet, forcing it to turn at an angle which is totally unacceptable. Why do companies feel the need to screw up what were good products.\n25#Muy buena opción. Para reemplazar los swiches de la pared, muy bueno y de calidad\n26#Does not pair with hue bulbs. I was unable to pair this with any of my hue bulbs and unfortunately all product guides online do not offer a solution.\n27#Great product. Very easy to setup. Super efficient for my smart home\n28#Not compatible with 99% of installed switch... HUE BS is the catch... nothing else works. Useless for most all homes.\n29#Doesn't work. Terrible product. We had the older generation and it worked pretty consistently. This one stopped working consistently after a few weeks and would only work sometimes. After a few months it stopped working entirely\n30#Dimmer switch. It was use and couldn't get it to work\n31#This product made life simpler! Our new home was wired as we would have not choose. The light switch to the master ceiling fan was to the left and on the wall just past where the door ends. The wall to the right had space for a single switch and is where the most traffic is. It is great to be able to easily turn the ceiling fan and light on and off from a more practical location. I highly recommend this product if you are in the market for a simpler, more practical location for a light switch. It is very light weight and easy to install.\n32#Works with any Hue compatible lights. I have four version 1 Philips Hue dimmer switches. They work great and come with a magnet backed base plate. This version 2 dimmer has a couple of design changes. The V1 on switch now functions as an on/off switch. The V1 off swith is now designated for Scenes and will cycle through them with each press. The base plate is slightly larger on this version than the V1 ( New swith also has rounded corners - which means you can't use old V1 wallplates with V2 switches ). Even though the Philips website claims the wallplates will connect to magnetic surfaces e.g. fridges. The V2 does not have magnets. It only has peel off adhesive strips. If it still had magnets it would get 5 stars. Devices is great. The design is lacking.\n33#There's a serious flaw. After using numerous smart lighting options from different manufacturers it's clear that Philips Hue is above & beyond all others for ease & reliability. Aside from the outrageous cost of the sync box, almost everything is worth paying a little more for. Then I got this V2 dimmer switch. Works well like all other hue devices except for one glaring issue. Apparently Philips thought it would be a good idea to remap the buttons with no apparent way to change that. So now when I want to turn off my dimmed lights I press the bottom button like on my other 4 switches & I'm drowning in lighting at it's brightest setting. Trying to remember which version switch I'm using is annoying to the point that I will try to find an old V1 switch and return this. My question to Philips - is this a ploy to frustrate your customers into upgrading all their dimmer switches? Please fix this.\n34#Great product! I've found Hue products to be very good. The Hue dimmer switch is no exception. Add this to a room for guests (easier to use than a voice assistant) or just to have another option for controlling your lights. The power on/off and Hue bottons are also highly configurable. I've setup the on/off button to control a room and the hue button to turn on/off all lights on the same floor. By default the hue button is set to change scenes.\n35#Works great. We love high hue lights in our bedrooms. This is a perfect addition and goes right over the switch plate.\n36#Easy to setup. Easy to setup. It comes with adhesive so you can stick on any wall. Works great with Alexa.\n37#Quick setup and easy to use! I got tired of opening the app every time I wanted to turn on or off the lights in my bedroom. I have this remote mounted on my nightstand and with a click of one button all of my lights turn off and on.\n38#No está mal. La calidad de los producto de Philips es excelente, pero el material de este control no se siente de calidad, podría mejorar y hacer el toque de los botones un poco más delicado\n39#Perfect!! These switches are easy to set up (we use Home Assistant) and infinitely flexible. They can stay on the wall, but they're also portable. We can also control the lights on our phones, but these are easy for guests to use. They're a serious upgrade to our smart home controls!\n40#So easy! The Hue Smart Dimmer Wireless Switch is a fantastic addition to my home. Installation is a breeze, allowing me to place it anywhere I need. I have mine installed upstairs, controlling a Hue flood light downstairs. The detachable remote is incredibly convenient—I can take it outside with me when I take the dog out, giving me full control of the light. This switch has truly enhanced the functionality and convenience of my lighting setup.\n41#Love These. Have multiple ones around the apartment. These are great as you can set them for different scenes for different rooms. Makes it very easy to control your lights without a phone or voice device. These stick to the wall so no installation required. The switch can come out of the casing to be used as a remote control for the lights. Highly recommended for any user of Hue Lights.\n42#Functional, but a bit disappointing. Setting up in the hue app is easy, although I with the customization options were a bit more robust. It works reliably but sometimes you need to double press the button for it to register, which is a mild nuisance. I like that it magnetizes to its wall holder so you can pick it up off the wall, but overall I would expect a more polished experience on the software and function side given how expensive this product and Phillips Hue are as a whole.\n43#Works, but extremely frustrating. These switches work, the battery lasts a long time, etc. They're also pretty much the only option if you want a physical switch to work with your hue lights, so it's not like you have a choice anyway. That said, after using them for a few months, the user experience is one of the worst I've ever seen in a tech product. Together with the app, they were clearly designed by someone who has never used a standard light switch before. One example, when configuring the \"on/off\" button on the top, you can either have it so a button press turns the lights on, OR turns the lights off. ***there's no way to do both!!*** The whole reason I bought these was to avoid having to fumble with my phone all the time to manage lights, but so far I've spent just as much time trying to force their square peg into a round hole. Altogether an endlessly frustrating product, but unfortunately still pretty much the only option.\n44#Easy to pair and use. As always, all the Hue accessories just work!\n45#Works well. The switch is simple to set up and integrates nicely for room level and home level light control, but I experience frequent latency from when I click a button and an action takes place.\n46#Excelente. Excelente producto, se ve de gran canlidad, excelente integracionistas con HomeKit\n47#Love it. After my first switch died on me I bought this one. I have it attached to my headboard and is so handy to be able to reach over and turn off my lights after I am done reading at night. Without having to get up. Very easy to set up.\n48#Fantastic Purchase and works flawlessly. The ease of installation is amazing. On top of that, at no point has this product malfunctioned. It easily connected to all of my Hue Lights, which are spread throughout every room in my house.",
