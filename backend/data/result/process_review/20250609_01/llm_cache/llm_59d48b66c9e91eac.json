Lower right corner of switch makes no or intermittent connection. This is on all of the switches in the box that I received. If you squeeze the corner it works fine.\n1#Nice white color. Easy to switch out for old outlets\n2#So convenient and reliable. The price was very reasonable, the product has great quality and it arrived on time. Thanks!\n3#Great product. Very satisfied with the quality and value\n4#Easy to install. Easy to install\n5#Cheaper to buy 10 here than 4 locally. Nice that they can be used as a 3 way as well as 4 way. More costly, but overall, 4 ways locally run around $8 each.\n6#Exactly what you'd expect. These worked great. They work, look good, and were easy to install.\n7#Great price. This is a very durable easy to install switch at a very economical price\n8#Can be used for 2 way and 4 way. I got this pack to replace a bunch of gross almond colored light switches in our home that was built in the 70’s. My husband is handy and had absolutely no trouble installing these. I’ve pictured a 2 way switch installed photo to show you how it looks, and a comparison to our old 2 way switch. It’s a much bigger box, but the switch itself is not quite as long and there’s no on/off words for the toggle. Neither of those minor things bother me in the least bit, but I felt they’re worth mentioning. For the installation, the words on the back go just like you’d expect - they are right side up. At least, that’s what we’ve found to work for all of ours. We’ve only used five so far, but we haven’t run into any bad ones or problems. Great product. Happy to have found it.\n9#Shorter than standard toggles. Finally got around to using these switches I bought for a project. Unfortunately, they aren't Leviton quality... They work, but they feel and look low quality; the toggles are shorter than other switch brands, so things look a bit off when combined with other switches in same panel, and the action feels and sounds very \"clicky\". Another reviewer noted no \"on\" or \"off\" labels; but this is normal for a 3 or 4 way switch, as there really is no \"on\" or \"off\" position. As noted in product description, no back wire option, so you have to form a hook on each wire; not a big deal, just more of a pain to install, especially a 4 way, needing all 5 wires. If someone were paying me to install these, I'd definitely be looking for something else.\n10#Light switches. Great product\n11#Easy replacement for old switches. All of the switches in our home are off-white and I wanted to switch them to white. We bought these as a direct replacement. They were easy to install. They fit well and feel solid. They look good, so I am very happy with getting these switched at this low of a price!\n12#Solid product. You cannot just push-in, you need to make a loop and use a screw to affix wires, but other than that it works perfect\n13#Nice pack of replacement light switches. Not a whole lot to report here. They are just light switches. The switch action is crisp and does not feel sloppy. the metal work is clear everywhere is where is should be. the palstic molding is clean and sharp. No complaints. replacing all the swtiches in the house. Excellent price value point.\n14#Quiet Toggle Switch 15 Amp 4 Way 120/277 VAC-10 Pack-NO PUSH IN BACK Wire Points-Side Screws Only-UL. I received this product in exchange for my honest review as part of the Amazon Vine Program. Seller AIDA lists these as \"AIDA 15 Amp 4 Way Toggle Switch Self-Grounding Indoor Quiet Turn ON Off Toggle, Residential Grade, UL Listed, Side Wired, 10 Packs, White\". I had a toggle switch fail and decided to give these a try. This 10 pack of Residential Toggle Switches is UL listed. The switches have appropriate J Box screws and screw terminals on each side as well as a ground screw. (Picture 1). These can be used to do 4 way switching with a \"traveler\" wire and come with a diagram. I did find that these switches as noted in their title and description DO NOT have push in wire connector points on the back (Picture 3). This is clearly stated by the seller but it is a fairly standard feature on most switches and outlets and detracts from the overall usefulness and ease of installation rating. Also, close examination shows NO \"ON\" or \"OFF\" letters on the plastic toggle. Most switches have that lettering. The toggle action is firm and positive without a \"snap\" sound like older style toggle switches. Without care one could easily install a switch upside down accidentally - you can tell only by the ground screw located at the switch bottom if you don't pay attention to hot and neutral wire colors. Consequently I have given these a 4 Star rating. Recommended with limits stated.\n15#Great price to switch out those old beige ones. Using these to update the house that had the old beige ones. Only the switch is included. Quite easy to install and they do the trick. I think the \"quiet\" description means they are easy to switch on and off as old ones didn't switch as smoothly.\n16#The perfect white switch. We are in the middle of renovation, and needed to update our electrical. We hired an electrician to install these for us. Here's the run down. - Neatly packed switches came on time. The white color was exactly what we were looking for. - The electrician showed me how he installed it. It seemed very straight forward and easy to install (he didn't have any luck with our smart switches). - The switches seemed quiet and sturdy when I turned on and off. Solid 5* if you're looking for basic switches\n17#Good, solidly constructed switches. Can be used as single pole or 4 way toggle switches for home use. Quiet snap on and off, no loud clicking. Got these to replace older beige switches in our new house. Excellent, professional quality.\n18#The switch throws are shorter than most switches. I bought a pack of these and noticed that they are about 3/16th of an inch shorter than the typical Leviton switches. They feel very awkward when flipped and they don't stick out very far from the switch plate. Returned.\n19#Screw contact only. No push in contacts on these. Otherwise same as typical.\n20#Like these, cost was right too! Cost was right! Needed 6 of these for project at home. If doing new project and not familiar with this circuit, do your research in advance, many sources for these schematics online. If existing project, replace wire to wire. Colors of contacts were same as original hardware. Functionally, works nicely. Not marked on off on purpose. No complaints. Enjoy.\n21#Good price but don't match other brands. We purchased these because they were much cheaper than 4-way switches at home Depot or Lowe's but unfortunately they didn't match our other switches which are Legrand. The switch was noticeable shorter and wider so we had to return the Aida switches.\n22#Great for cost. Worked great.\n23#As good as any name brand switch. Fits perfectly in the box, sturdy and most welcomed quantity, switch smooth and quick, color as described, these are great switches. I could not find 4way switches at Lowe’s or home depot. But find plentiful supply online. Was just what I was looking for. Thanks.\n24#Great price. Perfect price and worked great\n25#You get what you pay for... Cheaply made. Switch will not fit standard cover plates",
