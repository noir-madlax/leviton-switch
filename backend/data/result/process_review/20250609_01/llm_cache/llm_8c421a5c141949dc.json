    "prompt": "Extract comprehensive customer insights from reviews about Three Way Multi-Location Control Switches.\nThe output format is JSON in English:\n{\n\"phy\": {\n\"<PHYSICAL>\": {\n\"<PID>@<DETAIL>\": {\n\"<SENT>\": [ID, …]\n}\n}\n},\n\"perf\": {\n\"<PERF>\": {\n\"<perf_id>@<DETAIL>\": {\n\"<SENT>\": {<PERF_REASON>: [ID, …]}\n}\n}\n},\n\"use\": {\n\"<USE>\": {\n\"<SENT>\": {<USE_REASON>: [ID, …]}\n}\n}\n}\n\nDefinitions:\n- <PID>: Unique ID for physical aspect (\"phy\"), starting from A. After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Three Way Multi-Location Control Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Three Way Multi-Location Control Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment. Include all mentioned reasons, or \"?\" if none can be inferred. <USE_REASON> and <USE> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- <PHYSICAL>/<PERF> and <DETAIL> MUST NOT include:\n  * Generic statements without details (e.g., \"good\", \"bad quality\")\n  * Issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., \"fast shipping\", \"delivery time\")\n- If a review mentions any physical aspect, related performance, or use together, extract them as separate entries under \"phy,\" \"perf,\" and \"use,\" with no overlap.\n- Make sure each <DETAIL> is under the most relevant <PHYSICAL> or <PERF> in the context of Three Way Multi-Location Control Switches\n- Preserve negations\n\nKey Instructions:\n- Break down reviews with multiple aspects, performances, or uses into individual entries.\n- Escape special characters with backslash that could cause JSON syntax errors.\n- Include only explicitly mentioned reasons, and use \"?\" where no reason is mentioned.\n\nFinal Checklist:\n- Go through all reviews and ensure that no aspect, performance, use, or reason is omitted, even if only mentioned once.\n- Review all entries to ensure proper separation between aspects, performances, and uses.\n\nPrint the JSON result only.\nInput format:\n<ID>#<review>\n\n[[INPUT]]\n0#Good! Good quality\n1#Missing screws. Great product looks awesome but missing screws on many of them.\n2#Buenos. Funcionan bien y se ven muy bien\n3#Looks so fancy. Easy installation and looks so fancy , however note it is thinner than standard white switches, not big deal .. little paint touch up should do the work\n4#Poor decision to only sell in bulk. Great product would have loved to use them but I don’t need 10 3-gang covers, 10 2-gang cover and 10 light switches for for my bed room…? I need only one 3-gang cover, one 2-gang cover and two single switches with covers. Lost me and a lot of other people as customers selling in bulk and not letting them pick their own desired amount for their specification needs.\n5#Buena compra. Me encantaron. Le dan un toque moderno a la casa.\n6#Luxury look. I like this item it gave the apartment a luxury look willl buy again\n7#Sleek cover. Install was very easy. They’re perfect!\n8#Excellent product. Excellent product\n9#Very nice. updated old switches they look great and modern\n10#No consistency. The trim around the switch is gloss black. The switch is matte, but sparkly. The plate cover is matte black, but doesn’t match the rest of the pieces. Just a mess, really disappointed. Would return but the electrician needs them tomorrow. Will definitely replace with a better quality product\n11#A+ excellent! Listen, if you're looking for a \"quiet\" light switch save yourself some time and don't buy these. They click to an on off position which for me is a HUGE plus, I want to hear the light go from being fully on to fully off, I don't need a flimsy switch. Build quality is spot on, my electrian even made a comment on how good these were compared to the big box brands. Finish is perfect in matte and the covers match it perfectly.",
