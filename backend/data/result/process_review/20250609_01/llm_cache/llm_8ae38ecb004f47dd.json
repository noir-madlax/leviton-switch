After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Slide Control Dimmer Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Slide Control Dimmer Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment. Include all mentioned reasons, or \"?\" if none can be inferred. <USE_REASON> and <USE> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- <PHYSICAL>/<PERF> and <DETAIL> MUST NOT include:\n  * Generic statements without details (e.g., \"good\", \"bad quality\")\n  * Issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., \"fast shipping\", \"delivery time\")\n- If a review mentions any physical aspect, related performance, or use together, extract them as separate entries under \"phy,\" \"perf,\" and \"use,\" with no overlap.\n- Make sure each <DETAIL> is under the most relevant <PHYSICAL> or <PERF> in the context of Slide Control Dimmer Switches\n- Preserve negations\n\nKey Instructions:\n- Break down reviews with multiple aspects, performances, or uses into individual entries.\n- Escape special characters with backslash that could cause JSON syntax errors.\n- Include only explicitly mentioned reasons, and use \"?\" where no reason is mentioned.\n\nFinal Checklist:\n- Go through all reviews and ensure that no aspect, performance, use, or reason is omitted, even if only mentioned once.\n- Review all entries to ensure proper separation between aspects, performances, and uses.\n\nPrint the JSON result only.\nInput format:\n<ID>#<review>\n\n[[INPUT]]\n0#Works well. Got it a few months back and it works well\n1#Beautiful! Added an elegant touch to our nursery.\n2#They look great and funtion very well! Installation is easy. The switch functions for either single pole or 3 way. Dimming works well with led bulbs.\n3#Top greener is without a doubt my favorite. I have purchased several of these top geeener smart switches. Top greener, in General, I believe is the top manufacturer of smart products. They work excellent with my recessed lights.\n4#Unfinished project. I was disappointed to learn the face cover did not come in the package.\n5#Love it. Never knew this existed. I actually turn lights off and in with my phone! Live it!\n6#Survived over two months and still works. I’ve had this switch for about two months now (that’s about how long it took my old smart switch to start malfunctioning) and it hasn’t given me any problems. I honestly was scared that these smart switches are just made to be replaced every couple of months after warranty expires so I didn’t want to give it a review until I knew it was a little more sturdy. Anyways, I’m happy with this smart switch and it goes above and beyond my expectations with how easy it was to connect with Alexa and how easy it is to use the app that it connects to. Overall I think that any smart switches I get in the future will be from this brand.\n7#Descripción incorrwcta. No viene con función wifi",
