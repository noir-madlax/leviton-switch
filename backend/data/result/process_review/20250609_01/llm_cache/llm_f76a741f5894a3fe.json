Terrible instructions and they dont want to pair.\n1#Nice smart home addition. Easy hook up. Works with Vivint security and Alexa.\n2#The Range Doesn't Seem as Good as Enbrighten. I bought two of these. I've installed several by Enbrighten. These do not seem to be as good. I had trouble with both of them. For the first time, I moved the hub to install them. I've never had to do that before with Enbrighten. And then, one still had trouble staying connected. It's almost as if they do not have the same range. Tell Alexa to turn it on or off ... and she may say okay, but nothing happens ... until later ... maybe. The Smartthings app is the same way. It tries to turn the switch on or off, and sometimes it does ... eventually. I plan to replace these with Enbrighten. The white that I want is not available right now, but I can put up with almond ... for something that works. Cosmetically, the two brands look almost the same ... and they wire the same. They just don't seem to function the same, though.\n3#Not connection friendly. No directions on finding the app to control on off periods, it tells you how to install but not how to controll it\n4#works great. This product was straightforward to install and easy to connect to my smart home system (Smartthings in this case). Nice price and it working just fine.\n5#Super easy install and works great. Super easy install and works great\n6#Won't work without another piece of hardware. It needs a \"hub\" or else it won't work. I returned it, I just wanted a switch, not a whole new system with more hardware.\n7#Coolest and most simple toggle switch I've installed! This Zwave switch was a breeze to install. The simple install feature makes it so simple. You can hook up the line and load wires to the switch any way and the switch is intelligent enough to determine which is the line and which is the load. I was able to install this switch in 3 minutes. The built-in light also is a nicely added touch. You can change the color of the light and even turn it off if you prefer. There is nothing complicated about this toggle switch. It just works! What I like: - Easy to install - Zwave compatible - Alexa compatible - Built-in light is cool What I dislike: - N/A\n8#It works. What I liked about this product was that it was easy to install. At first i would shut off the light and the switch would beam blue light through out the room. If i turned off the lights whats the point of a beam in my room? Well found out you can change it to any color you want or cut it off all together. That was a plus. What I don't like about it. It is not the same as the button it tries to imitate. My other ones flick up and stays up flick down and stays down. This one seems like its a button that stays in the middle. You flick it down it will turn off the lights and return to the middle. Many times I walk into the room and I have to flick it 2 or 3 times to get it right. That is very annoying. That is not going to remove any stars because they never claimed it to be like the original light switches on my wall. I use a hubitat to control it. It works flawless every time. It does what they promised. I'm not sure I want flimsy feeling switches through out my whole house. I'm not getting another like it. I will continue my search for a nice switch to replay call switches in my house with. This one will end up in a closet somewhere. It does do what it claims so 5 stars for this one.\n9#It works! It works and integrates with Ring's Alarm Base. It's easy to connect by adding a new 'security device' from the hub, but did take a couple of retries due to an odd Z-Wave security failure. Once connected though, state is controllable via Alexa. Only reason I didn't give it 5-stars is that it doesn't scream high-quality. If you just want a low-cost switch to make some lights smart and integrates well with Ring and Alexa, a great option. If you are looking to do it with a premium feel, there are premium options with premium costs.",
