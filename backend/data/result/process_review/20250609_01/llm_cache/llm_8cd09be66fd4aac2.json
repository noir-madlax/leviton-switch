Bought this to replace an old one that failed. Installed easily. Worked perfectly. Arrived quickly.\n1#Lasted 1 Month. Do not waste your $,Get a better one than this.Connected to 6- 100watt bulbs and worked for 1 month and return window is closed.\n2#Good dimmer. Replaced a non-dimmer switch.\n3#A Good Switch. I bought this as replacement for a broken dimmer switch. It came with three switch covers, white, ivory and almond. I had difficulty with installation when a screw insert in tge switch box broke off. Now installed the switch looks and works like new.\n4#Great product! They worked for what we needed!\n5#Comes in all three colors. Product works great powering and \"dimming\" my 1000 watt waterfall pump. Very pleased. Wasn't clear in the description that this item includes faceplate in all three colors to match our decor. Would definitely recommend.\n6#Great replacement for my current switches. These were to replace old switches and worked perfectly. I wish that the covers also came in black.\n7#Had to replace one because of an early failure. These work well with no flicker or any of the other dimmer issues. But they are pretty expensive. Bought 3, one failed after a few years. It was a matched set so I was stuck buying another. Oh, well.\n8#Well made. Appears to be well made and gets the job done!\n9#Worked great. Works as advertised\n10#Quality. Excellent quality! Features are perfect.\n11#Fine. Replacement\n12#incandescent only. No LED. No CFL. INCANDESCENT ONLY. Will not control florescence, CLF, also not LEDs. Website is wrong. The box says incandescent only.\n13#Quality products. Very satisfied and well packaged.\n14#Easy to install. Works as it should\n15#Using for years. Not a lot to say. These switches work well and stand up to 3 boys constantly turning lights on and off.\n16#Excellent dimmer switch. I was very pleased with this item. Well-packaged, with clear directions. 3 different color front cover plates. The only thing missing was wire nuts. It took me about 15-20 minutes, start to finish, to install this dimmer switch for our entry foyer light.\n17#Five Stars. These are my favorite dimmer switches. Have them throughout the house.\n18#Stay Away From This Brand. I have a houseful of these dimmers and the on off toggle fails frequently due to bad engineering. (These are labeled \"Assembled in Mexico.) Replacements (now labeled \"Made in China\") are problematic for different reasons: The mounting screws are shorter than customary making installation a problem, the wiring convention has been changed making a direct replacement a nuisance, and the instructions are impossible to read. All-in-all, poor design which is not user friendly. I have fired engineers for less than these design faults.\n19#Great features on this manual switch. Perfect switch for use in our kitchen.\n20#Five Stars. Works great with a bunch of LED ceiling lights.\n21#... have several of these and still considered as the best. Already have several of these and still considered as the best.\n22#Excellent transaction. Item was just as stated very pleased with purchase.\n23#Disappointing! At first I was very happy with this dimmer: looks nice, comes with a choice of color, and is very smooth to use. But after 2 years it started malfunctioning: I had to press the on-off button several times to make it work.And then it stopped working completely so I couldn't turn the lights off at all! My son who works in home renovation also noticed how hot it gets and warned me that it could become a serious fire hazard! Yet it is controlling 9x60w bulbs only (540w). I am disappointed and am now looking for a different one.\n24#Five Stars. Great switch this was a replacement of a previous one that lasted 10 years with lots of use.\n25#Just what I needed. Great product. Easy to install. !000watts.Works great.\n26#Good product. Worked as well as I expected. Good product.\n27#Can't handle high-wattage halogen lamps. I installed this to switch 900 watts of halogen track lights, and it worked fine until the switch wore out after two years. I have had the same problem with other brands. It seems that the switch can't handle the high inrush current from halogen lamps. I would only try to use this up to maybe 500 watts of halogen fixtures. My solution, since I had the space in the switch box, was to buy a new unit (different brand) and use a separate switch to switch the power to this unit.\n28#Five Stars. We needed the push button piece, had to buy the whole switch\n29#Modern look. Nice design modern look\n30#Break after a year or two. Like the popular low review, I like this dimmer switch, but after two years I'm already replacing half of my switches. Stopped reliably turning on and off, and even developed a short or something because one switch started to smoke and heat up excessively.\n31#Excellent product. Excellent product as all Liviton products have been over the 30 years that I have been buying them. Light is great to find switch in the dark\n32#Excellent product! Could handle more watts but otherwise an excellent product! could also have more \"play\" when choosing how much to dim / brighten.\n33#poor life. I expect a lifetime of service out of a good switch. This one was in a hallway, hooked up to a 60 watt bulb that doesn't even get used very often, but now the light doesn't dim, it just stays on high, and the switch is only 6 years old. I'm going to have to find a different model to replace it.\n34#Works as advertised. I bought this for a chandelier with 14 75 watt equivalent LEDs that is really bright for my front hallway. It works great. No buzzing. Green LED is illuminated when the light is off.\n35#Nice while its work, which is not that long. I purchased this dimmer in September 2012. its running 800W load. In July 2013 it started malfunctioning. To turn it on or off would take 3-10 pushes which is gradually become worth and worth. Will bite the bullet and buy something more durable and expensive. Expected much better quality from Leviton. I guess China manufacturing is not that great.\n36#good dimmer. Glad the electrician did the installation as this had more wires than the old dimmer, but it works just fine.\n37#Great price! As an electrical contractor, it never occurred to me to look for specialty items on Amazon. Wow! I got this dimmer for half of the quoted prices here locally in Alaska! I will use this in the future for sure!!!\n38#Leviton Switch really is great. This switch works exactly as described. It was very simple to install. It operates as I want. It arrived very quickly and the packaging was excellent. It did come with some extras so it would be useful in many situations but I did not need those. When I need another similar switch this will be my choice.\n39#Does not last. The dimmer works fine and it has a good look with no hum but plan on replacing it every 3 years. The switch part of the dimmer fails so when you push it nothing happens. This is my 4th switch. I would change manufacturers but they are te only ones with the 1000W version. Iwill keep looking for an alternative\n40#Recommended. Does the job well and is attractive. Reasonably easy to install but be sure to turn the breaker off first.\n41#Solid Product! We have several areas around the house that have more bulbs on a dimmer than the usual 600W will handle. You can pay a lot more at Home Depot or elsewhere to get 900W or 1200W, but this unit works great! I researched carefully and found that removing one side of the tabs de-rates from 1000W to 800W, and we have a circuit with 10 60W bulbs (10x60=600W). Working through the entire range from dim to bright, this unit never gets too hot - and we run the lights all night for back-yard security. I would have rated 5 stars but it is challenging big; takes some effort to get all the wires into a standard box. But then... that's why it can handle the heat! Go for it!\n42#A simple way to dim the lights. Purchased for our church in updating the electrical circuits. Simple installation and different color face plates make it a very versatile switch. Would recommend to anyone needing or wanting a dimmer switch.\n43#Short lifetime. I have been using this in the kitchen to switch an 800W load. I am on my 3rd in about 6 years. Dimmer always works, but on/off switch fails.\n44#it's right as usual. Leviton works great as usual. The dimmer works smoothly for my bathroom ceiling lights, Solux Daylight MR16, track lights. I will buy Leviton always. Great price!\n45#Why only 2 stars? I felt compelled to write this review on the basis of long-term satisfaction. First of all, we love these dimmers. They have a subtle green led that makes an attractive but muted glow, are easy to hit as an on/off button, and a very accessible and easily adjusted dimmer. We have every light in our house on dimmers, and they are a delight to use, look great, and are easy enough to use that you'll find yourself adjusting the amount of light nearly every time you use them. Why only 2 stars for something we like so much? Quality and durability. They break, repeatedly and often. We have over 80 of these dimmers in our home, with an average age of 5 years. We replace about 5-6 dimmers every year. The most common problem is when the push button switch stops catching-- I'm writing this to light of 3 chandeliers I can't turn off-- the switch won't work. They also crack. They are dimmers, and with moving parts, they are not expected to last as long as a simple rocker switch. But a 8-10% annual failure rate is simply too high. Some of the first ones we installed have been working now for 10 years without trouble. The newer ones we installed on our addition have had more problems. The one not working in my office was just replaced 4 months ago and is now broken. Great product, poor quality and durability. I'm certain Leviton knows this, and we have too many of them for this to be a random streak of bad luck, or a single bad batch. Great engineering can't trump poor quality control.\n46#Love these dimmers. Not sure what the negative comments are about - I have five of these dimmers installed in my house and love them. The oldest is almost 8yrs old and no problems with any of them to date. The green light makes the switches easy to find in the dark and the large on/off button is easy to hit. What more could you ask for?\n47#HORRIBLE QUALITY. These are the worst switches I have ever purchased. I cannot say enough bad about them. They cannot handle 1000w at all. I have purchased probably ten of these in the last two years. I have had 4 or 5 of them go bad on me now. I'm sure that all of them will go bad before too long. Do not buy these. You are wasting your money.",
