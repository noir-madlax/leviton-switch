Would rate at zero but that’s not allowed. Switches are very finicky. Sometimes the lights come on, sometimes they don’t. Sometimes you can turn the switch on and off several times and they work. Do not recommend.\n1#Dimming 0-10V defective. I ordered this a week ago and the dimming control is not working (0-10V) with the slider simulated at up and down at a time but it always hive 0V. I hate myself from ordering this.\n2#Good deal. I'm sure its great. We never got to use it, but whoever has likes it!\n3#Works great. Accidentally bought some commercial lights that needed a 0-10v signal for dimming. This was the perfect solution to get them up and running. Easy install and has been working flawlessly\n4#Versatile and Smooth LED Dimmer Switch. This LED dimmer switch is a great for lighting control! It works seamlessly with dimmable LED bulbs, providing smooth dimming without flickering. The single-pole or 3-way compatibility adds flexibility, and the included wallplate ensures a clean, modern look. Easy to install and use. Highly recommended!\n5#Didn’t work with the lights I installed. Trying to return this product\n6#Smart Dimmer Switch. I got this dimmer switch two years ago for my wife's she shed. It has been working flawlessly ever since installation. Installation was no more difficult than any other light switch. I have it connected to my 2.4ghz wifi, and control it with Alexa. Easy as can be.\n7#Does the Job. Does the job when the light fixture calls for a 0-10v dimmer switch.\n8#Looks and works great. Why is my photo of a light instead of the wall switch? Well because this is the type of light that this dimmer works with. The dimmer is a 0-10v dimmer. Most dimmer switches reduce the overall 120 voltage down to zero. They lower the voltage on the HOT wire. But this dimmer switch always sends the full voltage on Hot and two other wires send a low voltage of 0-10v. 0 is dimmed all the way (not off) and 10 is full brightness. The light I got was this one: https://amzn.to/4atB7UZ And it works great. I ran power from an outlet up to the switch using Romex and then from the switch you run Romex to the light but also 2 low voltage wires. I made a mess in the wall and ceiling there but that's pretty much how you do it. Easy to patch. 5 stars. This was the least expensive 0-10V dimmer I could find on amazon or anywhere else. All the ones at Home Depot were also more expensive.\n9#Used part. I was sent a used unit that was missing all the screws. Device doesn't work and you wasted two days of time. Why would you send a used defective item?\n10#Excellent dimmer. Product arrived quickly, and has worked pr=erfectly. Thanks!\n11#Seems good. Beware if you installed the Troffer LED lights because they require the more expensive higher quality LED switch. The light switch actually has to say it’s for LED Troffer not just LED.Also you have to install an extra low voltage wire.\n12#Nice simple switch. Works as described thus far and has a nice fit for my application. Unlike some, i did not experience any buzzing nor flickering after install .Would buy more if needed. Great value compared to others. Instructions could use improvement but otherwise not too complicated to figure out.\n13#Just what was needed. I installed an outdoor LED light and it required a 0-10v dimmer switch to adjust the intensity. This switch works perfectly with the on/off switch built in. Great price and fast delivery.\n14#started flickering. when you slide it all the way up to make the lights bright, it started flickering, of course the return window was expired, Ill have to order another unit, but it wont be this brand, I am not a testing site.\n15#Only worked for 2 weeks. Worked ok for 2 weeks, then lights began to dim and brighten on their own. Can't return after 30 days, so that means warranty is only good for 30 days. Seems unreasonable for something that should last years.\n16#Very good for the price. First the good, It was relatively easy to install. the markings on the back of the unit are nonsensical, but its not hard to figure out, they have the 3 way leg marked off on one of the 2 red wires, the other red wire is your switch leg, your black is your hot input, and the white and blue are youre gray and purple LV wires for the dimmer function. and if your light supports it it does dim exactly like its supposed to. The bad, This is a UNIT. i had to tuck the WAGO connectors behind the other switch because this thing uses up the entire depth of a junction box for itself. additionally its clearly a much lower grade of plastic than the Leviton switch in the box next to it, that crisp tactile click when switching the light on or off just doesn't exist and the plastics feel flimsy, also the dimmer at the bottom sort of just lets go, theres no tension for the bottom 2 or 3 mm so the lights go completely off instead of down to their lowest setting, i have to keep it about 20% up from the bottom to get the lowest dimmer position without them going completely off. not really sure though if thats intentional or a symptom of the dimmer curve on my lights. but the dimmer itself moves fine but is also made from flimsy plastic. it just doesn't feel as robust as a name brand unit, but for the price point thats to be expected. All in all this switch gets the job done very well and i plan to keep it for the foreseeable future. if i have any issues with it ill edit this review but value for the money is there and while I wouldn't recommend it for a heavy duty applications, for most projects this would be a very good solution.\n17#Love these. Great price and nice quality\n18#It's been installed a few months and no issues so far. I have had this installed for a few months. It works exactly like it should. It has a unqiue look, that could be a plus or minus. The price was good and delivery was convenient. I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.\n19#I installed it and it stopped working. I installed it on an LED outside 150-watt parking lot light and it lasted two weeks. I had it installed by a professional and he knew exactly how to install it, so it wasn't the installation, it just stopped working. it the light dims high then low than back over and over! Amazon won't let me return it because it's been more than 30 days the problem was, I had it waiting for the installer for three weeks by the time he installed it, it had started to malfunction. it was already 40 days from the time I bought it.\n20#Very satisfied! This dimmer was easy to install and works well, with no buzzing of the dimmer or the lights. It can be used to replace a single switch or two-switch system. A bright/dim controller allows adjustment of the lights at their minimum. Even at minimum setting the switch powers up the lights. This dimmer can be installed with a regular faceplate and two screws, which come with the package. No further product needs to be purchased in order to install.\n21#Poor schematics. The schematics did not show input AC, then internal switch wiring, finally output connection to devive. Also wiring not clear. Are 4 wires from switch box to the dimmable device required? I did not install due to poor directions.\n22#WORKS GREAT. easy install .\n23#Junk. Junk Rocker Switch broke in 3 months\n24#It's big. Hard to fit into the box, but works as good as the big name brands, You can't find a dimmer like this at Home depot or Lowes. This is the only one available. The others vary the input voltage, this one has a rheostats on the side to hook up to the driver.\n25#Works - sort of... The switch showed up on time and had all the parts it said it would have. Installation was pretty straightforward and mostly works with the Metalux 2x2' troffer lights I recently installed. The lights are pretty bright, so I wanted a dimmer (they use the 0-10V dimming scheme, which this product has). It looks nice and includes a faceplate. It is only in white, but I decided for the location, it would work. I have 2 issues: 1. The size of the switch/dimmer just barely fits in the box along with the wire nuts. Smaller would be nice. 2. The biggest issue is that the dimmer is not great. I have a different, major name brand I used in a different area on some of the same lights that has smooth action and cleanly goes from about 10%-100%. The KEYGMA dimmer doesn't have a very smooth feel; it has a loose at the bottom to tight at the top feel as you work the slide up and down. Worse, at the lowest setting the lights flicker then go out. Only after you get the slider up to where it feels like it \"catches\" will the light come on consistently at a dim level then go to full brightness as you push it up. I read the tips and suggestions that talk about a recessed potentiometer on the bottom that was supposed to do something, but it did nothing on my unit. The feel and action of the slider makes the switch feel cheap. Also, there is a small hole on the lower left front that I had assumed was an LED so you could find the switch in the dark. There is no light in that hole, so I guess it is just a hole. A little guide light would be nice. In all, I will continue to use this dimmer because it mostly works and I don't have it in a high use area. However, I will not buy another one and I do not recommend it. In my opinion, if you need a 0-10V dimmer/switch, I would spend the extra $10 and get a better one from a major named brand.\n26#Better products available. I personally did not like these.\n27#You get what you pay for. I got the first one, the switch worked just fine but the dimmer didn't. I tossed it and bought another, same thing. I bought a different brand and it works fine.\n28#It works. I wired it incorrectly at first and it would buzz when in the off position, and on/off were reversed… but with a little help from father in law got it right. Home Depot version was $85 so I was stoked to get this thing for a fraction of the price.\n29#Great price. Works great! Highly recommended\n30#dimmer switch for dimmable LED's. We ordered this single or 3 way dimmer switch for our dining room light, which is wired with a 3 way switch (meaning two separate light switches at either side of the room can turn it on or off). I am not yet able to install it for this purpose, because we don't have dimmable LED's yet, but I tried to test it on a single pole switch with an incandescent bulb. I admit, like others, that I found the wiring diagram confusing. There are six wires coming from this Keygma switch--two red, one black, blue, white, and green. The second red wire is identified by label as for 3 way applications, and does not need to be wired for single pole applications. I was unable to correctly configure the remaining wires according to my best understanding of the diagram, to get it to work. I think clearer instructions would help. The switch is ETL (Electrical Testing Laboratories) tested, which is an alternative to the UL (Underwriter's Laboratories) that you also find on many electrical products.\n31#Exactly as described. Exactly as described\n32#Couldn't get it to work. I've been installing plugs, switches, and dimmers for years but I could not get this one to work. Used a different brand and it worked instantly. I don't know if I just got a bad one or what but it didnt dim only turned the light on and off.\n33#Works well looks nice. Works well looks nice. Used in basement to Dim three 8 foot led lights. Customer used this area to work out and watch TV the full brightness of the LEDs would be a little much so using this dimmer was perfect.\n34#Did not work for me. My husband is pretty handy with electrical work, but could not get this to work. We have 5 candelabra bulbs in our dining room chandelier which are dimmable LED's. This says it is good for a single switch or 3 way., and I must say the diagram is a bit confusing. He tried to wire it per the diagram, but it didn't work, then he tried every possible combination of wires and it still didn't work. I'm sure an electrician could wire it, but it's not worth $200 to have them come. 3 stars.\n35#Works Great! I highly recommend this dimmer if you install any dimmable LED lights. The LED panels I purchased were bright enough to cause sunburn (not really) Since it was bright as daylight in my basement I bought this dimmer and it installed very quickly. And it worked on first try.\n36#nice dimmer switch. This switch was fairly easy to install once we figured out the instructions. Well-made. So far, it's working well.\n37#Worked for a couple days then stopped dimming. As the subject says, stopped dimming the led lights I install for my tile shower Niche. Ive installed 50+ dimmable transformers and never had an issue until purchasing this switch. It also was reversed so down was on and up was off.\n38#Easy to use. Provides the best dimming performance for dimmable LED lights is provided by a 0-10V low voltage LED dimmer switch with a dimming range of 5% to 100%. For use with dimmable LED/CFL bulbs up to 150 watts and Incandescent and Halogen lamps up to 600 watts. A huge rocker paddle is used to turn the lights on/off or to a preset level, and a fluent slider is used to brighten/dim the lights to suit various activities. The 0-10V LED dimmer switch is available in single pole and three-way configurations. Controlling full-range dimming with precision\n39#Works, but missing screws. Switch works, dimmer function works. Reason for three stars was missing screws for wall plate.\n40#Easy to install. This was easy to install. Works great!",
