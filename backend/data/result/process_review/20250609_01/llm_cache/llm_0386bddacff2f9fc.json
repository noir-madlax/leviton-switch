Work great and fast. Reliable\n1#Great! Best thing to happen to outlets since they were created. This was a huge time saver and safer. I hate having to cut the breaker to replace them and I typically don’t. This made it incredibly easy to change them out. FYI - For you backstabbers, i hope your pillow is forever 100 degrees.\n2#Great switch but won’t sit flush. These are so close to being great switches but they have so much plastic on top that they don’t work well with other switches in the same plate and they will never sit flush. The wiring design is perfect but it’s like the designers actively tried to make it worse so I had to return it.\n3#Great product. I am not a professional electrician. These made wiring a house way easier\n4#Quick installation does not feel like work. Leviton has done it again! Great Product…\n5#Leviton E5603-MW Decora Edge 15 Amp 3-Way Rocker Switch, 10-Pack, White. I’ve always been a fan of Leviton switches and outlets…until now. For some reason they’ve extended tabs above and below the box and now screwless wall plates will NOT fit flush against the wall! I had to hacksaw the plastic tabs off.\n6#Very disappointed! Box was ripped opened, Its very unpleasant when somebody else open what you paid for. It looks like it was a returned Item..\n7#good. no complaints\n8#Plastic extensions? There is a lot of Plastic at the top and bottom. Almost like a tab. I installed 5 (they work) but when i went to put the faceplate on it doesnt fit. I have other Leviton switches. I ended up cutting them off and now it fits. Seems like useless plastic. Learned Needle nose pliers can make a clean cut with twisting better than a cut.\n9#Screwless Cover plates dont work well. I attempted to use screwless faceplates from Leviton. They did not work well . I do not recommend . Hassle - so I used he standard Leviton .\n10#Fast and Safe Install. These things are game changers! I wasn’t sure about these but now these will be my go to due to ease of use and speed of installation. If you are not an electrician I would pick these up since it’s hard to get wrong. I’ve seen so many people install screw based switches incorrectly which can be dangerous. The quality seems awesome for the price, I feel like I could install these over and over without any pieces breaking apart. These switches also make it safer by not exposing any hot contacts once the wires are inserted.\n11#Let there be light. Just moved into a new house and wanted a different look for my light switches. Easy to install, good value for the money. Leviton makes a solid product. I replaced 60 switches in home. Leviton's all around. Rock solid product.\n12#Easy Installation. These are very nice solid switch and they are a breeze to install with the flip down wire clamps. Will buy more.\n13#Definitely faster and safer. Definitely faster and safer. Always wonder about anything that uses a spring clamp to hold over time especially at higher currents, but seem to hold. Wires will spin, so definitely, not as tight as a screw clamp type. About twice the cost. Harder to break bond between outlet for split feeds than a standard but can be done. Ok, as this is a fairly rare need. Can only handle one wire per clamp. This is especially annoying for bonding grounds in multi receptacle or switch boxes. Still plan to use in the future for at least some projects.\n14#Fixing outlets and switches. It's a good product and it was delivered properly and installed by professionals\n15#really like these new switches and the safety features. I really like the safety features, having no exposed wires or screws that could shock you. I really also like ease of installing these switches. I highly recommend these switches.\n16#Great quality and easy to install! I'll never go back! I only use Decora Edge switches and outlets now - they are SO easy to install and great quality for the price. I've bought & installed about 50 of the switches and outlets and haven't had a single issue.\n17#Great product. Big time saver. I have to replace all my receptacles in my house. All the receptacles in my house used push the wire into the hole type receptacle but after many years it loses a good connection. These lever action wire connection provides a very solid connection.\n18#Time saving!!! Solid build and ease of use. Saving a lot of time during installation. Direction of wires labels with different colors are clear and easy to understand. At one corner along the edge, it has a measure line. It is helpfull for diy to be able to measure how long wires need to be stripped. Highly recommended.\n19#Great switches. Much safer and easier to install\n20#Upgrade your light switches. We moved into a 28 year old house and I did not like the old light switches. These plug and play light switches from Leviton made it easy to update to the more modern rocker type switch. Very easy to use these.\n21#So easy to install. I used these to replace my flip switches that used to make a popping sound every time we flipped the switches on or off. These were so easy to install and they look so much better than the switches they replaced.\n22#I will never buy a switch or outlet that doesn't have the Decora Edge installation. I'm upgrading all of my light switches to Kasa Smart Switches but not every switch needs to be smart, especially on 3-way and 4-way circuits. I originally started with some cheap rocker switches but returned them when I found the Decora Edge. Smart switches take up a lot of space in multi-gang boxes, which doesn't leave much room for wire nuts or Wago connectors. With these switches, the wires stab directly into the switch or outlet and are much safer vs. backstabbing, which every YouTube electrician and DIYer says not to do.\n23#Couldn't get it working. Product came quickly, same mfg Good directions, but after 2 hrs trying syncing, changing battery that came with, I had return .\n24#Leviton Wiring Devices is Excellence in Design. I used to work for Leviton and have never used any other wiring device after my employment there. The exquisite design, quality of materials and the ISO certification of their manufacturing processes make all Leviton wiring devices the top of the line. This Decora Edge 15 Amp 3-Way Rocker Switch with it's wire flip tabs are easy to wire and install by a DIYer who has knowledge of electrical wiring. We highly recommend this Leviton 3-Way Rocker Switch.\n25#Just the best. I only use Leviton which are by far the best but these take it to a new level. Ease of install is crazy while leaving zero exposed wiring. I upgraded our entire 25 year old home all with Leviton lever terminals . Quiet and smooth operation. Nice clean bright white not off white like others.\n26#Works great. Work great easy to install, the levers make for easy DIY and is make better then back stabbing.\n27#Easy to install and fast. These are fantastic. I’ve been replacing dozens of outlets in my house and these really speed up the process compared to standard outlets with screw terminals.",
