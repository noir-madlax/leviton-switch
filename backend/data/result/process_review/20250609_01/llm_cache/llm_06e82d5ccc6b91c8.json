It works great, has a very good quality, is very aesthetic and very easy to install. I can confirm that although the product info states that only works with 110v, it also works in a 220v setup with no problem. I’m from Argentina and bought it from Amazon USA.\n1#Clear instructions. Works well with Tapo but not Smart Life. Our home has front porch lights and exterior up-lights on separate switches. These were both Intermatic timers, and one timer (unfortunately, with a non-removable battery) kept losing its program with every power outage. When I saw this two-pack on offer, I decided to replace both switches. Installation is well documented and straightforward and literally involved swapping out equivalent wires on the old timers onto the new. Even though I use Smart Life for all my home automation, I installed the Tapo app on my phone, purely so that I could upgrade the smart switches' firmware. This worked seamlessly. However, I was not able to get these devices to work with Smart Life (which is supposedly now compatible with the Matter standard). It recognized the devices and added them just fine. But when I attempted to program a scene, and got to the bit where you say which device feature you're trying to control, instead of seeing something like \"Switch\", I just got an entry with Chinese writing. Thinking this could have been a simple missing text issue, I selected this option, but it then gave an error when trying to save my scene. I don't know if this is an issue with these switches, or an issue with how Smart Life implements the Matter standard, so I didn't want to deduct a star in this review. It ended up not being a problem for me, as the only automation I want is a dusk-to-dawn schedule, never to be changed, and only to be overridden if I am at my front door and can just tap the switches directly. So, I programmed this in the Tapo app, which was super easy, and everything works as I need it to.\n2#Smart switches. One works fine the other keeps dropping signal every day and I have to enable skill in Alexa and resync my accounts(every day!)(every day!)not happy with!\n3#Light-switches-voice-activated. Great-product-love-their-service!!!!\n4#It used to be a good brand. Setup instructions don't work. I have tried many times to set this thing up according to the directions. It does not work wirelessly. No Bluetooth connection during setup. I can't send it back because I waited past the return date too long to install it. No more items from this company.\n5#Good product. Works fine but only time will tell how long\n6#Seamless Setup and Control. TP-Link continues to impress me with their Tapo and Kasa products. The hardware and software offerings are both very well built. Setup was very painless, the app instantly recognized the switch, and it was setup in Google Home within 60 seconds. Google Home also did recognize it as a Matter device immediately, but I chose to go through the Tapo app. The button is just as satisfying to click as the Kasa switches, and the automation features add additional functionality through Tapo itself or Home Assistant.\n7#Broke in 6 months. Quit working in 6 months. Worked great for maybe 6 months then suddenly, the light won't stay on. It switches on then immediately switches off. Of course the return window has passed. What a waste of time and money.\n8#Poor quality. Switch died within 4 months. It'll work with alexa but not the manual control. For the RMA, you would have to mail the switch in at your own cost before they can send the replacement at which point the RMA is useless. Don't bother buying this piece of junk unless it is at a throw away price.\n9#Buena opcion para apagar las luces desde mi cama. Es la solucion para conectarlo a alexa y apagar mis luces solo con mi voz.\n10#I love my tapo matter light switches. These are a great value. When they have coupons you can get them cheaper than a dumb Lutron light switch at Home Depot. I use apple home and they are easily and quickly added to HomeKit. I did install 3 switches at once and 2 were added then dropped off HomeKit. I readded them and they've been reliable since then. I've been using them for a couple months now and they've been great. They're replacing belkin wemo light switches. The wemo ones would power off and restart or look for updates almost nightly and when they do they'll power off for the 5-15 minutes every time. It was pretty dangerous on our kitchen light switch. These ones are a huge improvement.\n11#Great Price and Easy Install, But Big HomeKit Limitation and Low Power Rating. The Tapo S505 smart switch is priced very competitively and is very easy to install. The instructions were clear, wiring it up was simple, and it connected to my Wi-Fi and app without any issues. For basic use, it’s a good value compared to more expensive brands. BUT there are two important problems you should know about: 1. HomeKit “Display As” Problem (Very Important for Apple Users): If you use Apple HomeKit with Matter, the Tapo S505 always shows up as a “Light” — even if you are using it to control something else, like a ceiling fan, a bathroom fan, or an outlet. There’s no way to change it. This means that in the Home app, it will always have a lightbulb icon and will behave like a light. If you tell Siri to “turn off all lights,” it could accidentally turn off your ceiling fan or outlet too, because HomeKit thinks it’s a light. Other brands let you change what the switch is (“Display As”) so HomeKit knows it’s a fan or outlet — but the Tapo switch does not. This is a major limitation, especially if you want your smart home to be organized properly. Despite being advertised as flexible, right now the firmware locks you into it being treated like a light, no matter what. 2. Low Power Support for Fans: This switch only supports up to 120 watts when controlling a ceiling fan. Many fans, especially ones that have built-in lights, can easily use more than 120 watts. If you hook up a more powerful fan, this switch might not work properly or could potentially be unsafe. Competing smart switches often handle much higher wattages. Bottom Line: If you just need a cheap smart switch for simple lighting and don’t care about HomeKit details, this is a good buy. But if you plan to use it for anything other than lights, or if you want proper HomeKit setup and reliability, you should look elsewhere.\n12#The Smart Switch of Rage (+2). Oh where should I start? Packaging was nice. The app it tricked me into installing wasn't that bad, even if it did immediately send my data overseas. Right, the switch. Switches in this case. Dumb switch go up, light go on, dumb switch go down, light go off. Take out dumb switch. Dumb switch no have letters and two wires are black. Use magic box with numbers to tell which wire has the black magic of level 120. User of magic switch very smart and safe. Match colors to new switch of matter magic. Magic switch talks to magic house. Magic switch make clicking noises. No light. Try other magic switch. Same same. Dumb switch still work. To translate from Thok the smart, neither switch worked. Standard switch does. So angry that Thok the smart took over to write my review.\n13#Great smart switches! Extremely happy with these TP-link smart switches! They are simple to install and setup through the app. They look and work very well. I replaced Eaton smart switches that came installed with a new home we built. Eaton is trash. TP-link is excellent. Highly recommend!\n14#good. Easy to set up.\n15#practico. llego a tiempo. fácil de instalar\n16#Great quality switches, some of the best in the market and great value for money. These are some of the best smart switches I have installed. They pair quickly, are Matter compatible so I can put them on HomeKit in the Apple environment. My only gripe is that for the fan switch the HomeKit recognizes it as a light switch, and there's no way to change it. Regardless, these are highly recommended, I have used Meross and other smart switch brands, but nothing comes close to reliability, speed of reactivity and durability as Tapo switches. I was actually surprised that these are cheaper than the Levitron non-smart switches and come with a lot more functionality, and are made a lot better.\n17#Need in black. Works great with HomeKit and very easy to configure. I hope they make this switch in black soon.\n18#Easy instructions. Great for automatic on off. Easy install nice cover plate Easy app instructions\n19#Easy to install, and they just work. Incredibly easy to install. You don’t need to worry about which wire is the line or load, just match up the colors and that’s it. However, if you have an older house with smaller electrical boxes, these can be somewhat difficult to get back in. Matter connectivity makes adding these to multiple ecosystems effortless, but I do wish they didn’t require the Tapo app to update the firmware.\n20#Good alternative to Wemo switch. Bought these instead of Wemo switches. We program our outdoor lights with these and have been happy. Yes, recommend!\n21#Well made & works great with Apple HomeKit & Homeseer. Does not fit well with screwless wallplates. These work great with Apple Home and with HomeSeeer. Very easy to install. I do wish there was a setting for the brightness of the locator/indicator LED, to allow for a brighter setting during daylight. FYI: Add it to the Tapo App before adding it to Apple Home, then add it to HomeSeer. UPDATE: None of the TP-Link switches fit properly in screwless wall plates, except the one that comes with it. If you are going to install it in a multi-gang arrangement, the screwless wall plates will not sit flush with the wall, making for a very ugly installation. Their mounting ears are made of thick plastic, instead of thinner metal which is the cause of the problem.\n22#Easy and great switches! While TP link is not my favorite, these Matter compatable switchs install easly, work great and are only missing a Windows app of webbased full access. I will be buying more.\n23#Impressed! Surprisingly impressed with this product. I purchased this in July of 2024. Easy to install, setup and use. It controls my outdoor lights. Works as expected. I have been using the Tapo app to control and schedule when the light turns on and off. Very easy to use. The physical switch is durable and works as expected. I added it to my Apple Home in February 2025. It didn’t connect right away, but a simple reset on the switch resolved the issue. I was able to set up an automation schedule. When someone in my household arrives home the light turns on and shuts off after 15 minutes. Set up to run between sunset and sunrise. I can ask Siri to turn it on and off using my iPhone or HomePod mini. The automation works seamlessly. Highly recommended!\n24#Reliable and easy to set up. I have about 18 of these throughout my house and they all work every time.\n25#Nice brand and works ok. Worked fine and arrived ok\n26#Great, scalable solution for smart homes. I have installed about 40 of these (counting some S505D dimmer switches) in my home. These look good, work well, are easy to install. Out of the 40, only one arrived defective, and a dimmer switch broke because I was trying to operate a non-dimmable LED driver with it. Setup is somewhat slow, and the Tapo app does not support Matter setup. To work with Matter, they need to be set up via Google Home or whatever else you're using first. Then they can be added to the Tapo system. All of this is a bit slow if you're installing many switches at a time -- it would be nicer to be able to add all of them at once. The switches have minimal configurability. Other such products offer to turn off the relay (so it becomes a virtual switch that gets connected via software rules to do something). However, they do offer a \"delayed shutoff\" functionality, an \"auto-off timer\", and LED indicator config that includes a nice, automatic night mode that's great for bedrooms. Wifi connectivity is strong and reliable -- better than some SONOFF products I've tried, and no problems with DHCP leases running out like with many older products. Tip: I found that automations in the Tapo world run faster than via Google Home (which always goes via Cloud, even though you've got to have a local Matter server).\n27#Works with Google can do lights anywhere. Got this switch to help me with some home automation. Was able to connect this easily with Google Home afterwards. Uses the Tapo app. If you already have the Kasa app, the login is the same to Tapo now I’m able to turn my lights on and off from anywhere with an Internet connection. I was able to also set this up with Google Home to automate when the lights turn on and off now only needed 10 minutes and connect to black one white and one green wire.\n28#Great multi switch position alternative. These are easy to install and if you have good wifi coverage it will make installing a three way or more switch not necessary. We have a workshop with outside lights surround it and it makes turning those lights on easy as turning on your phone. The app also lets you see which switches are turned on. Great alternative to an expensive electrician call. They can be a bit finicky to pair to the wifi. It took me a few attempts on certain switches.\n29#Garbage - don't buy. I installed about a dozen of these. The price is great but.... Having spent hours and hours trying to get them to work, I am ripping all of them out. The electrician costs were much higher than the costs of good switches.\n30#Perfect for outdoors lights with a switch indoors. Perfect for outdoors lights with a switch indoors\n31#easy to install and set up. surpisingly easy to install. I thought wifi setup might be complicated, but scan the QR code and boom! done. Alexa integration into groups means these coordiante with other wifi switches to turn all our outdoor lights on or off at once, or in separate groups. don't hesistate to get this.\n32#Basic Affordable Matter Switch. It does the job for the price but these are pretty basic switches. I already found that both of the switches I installed needed a reset a week after only a week because they disconnected from the wifi at different times for no apparent reason. At least they are pretty simple to reset with the small button on the bottom of the switch.\n33#Easy installation and reasonably trouble-free setup. I was hesitant to purchase this switch based on the reviews and warning from Amazon that this item is frequently returned. I’m glad I got the purchase button. The installation was easy, matter setup took a while, but it wasn’t too difficult. Setup using Google home or Tapo app is pretty easy, then adding to Apple home was a breeze. It works well with Apple Home as well as Google home.\n34#Easy to Setup/Program! Works great and easy to use. Easy DIY project. Wish I had them throughout my entire house.\n35#Stops working.No \"up\" switch, always looks on. The device just stopes working sometimes. Integrations just randomly stop triggering. It has to be polled to get status. You cannot press \"up\" to turn it on. It is a toggle button. I showed it to my wife, and she said \"nope.\" It would be very confusing for guests. It's a shame because it's so cheap.\n36#Good Quality and Reliable. I have tried several brands of smart switches and outdoor cameras with poor success. These other brands needed restting often. Lots of fiddling needed to use. I have standardized with this brand of smart devices and cameras. No smart device is perfect using wi-fi, but I have experienced very few issues. I recommend this brand.\n37#Works great with matter-over-wifi and Home Assistant. I'm not the biggest fan of wifi smart home devices, but these are so cheap, I had to try them. They aren't perfect: they can take a couple of tries to connect, and occasionally they miss a signal to turn on or off. But overall, I can complain for the price. I have about a dozen and intend to add a few more.\n38#Work great! Easy to set up and have been working great!\n39#works well with google home. works well with google home\n40#Difficult to setup, unreliable. These switches are difficult to configure. I had to try multiple times to get it to connect to my iPhone during set up. once configured, it works for a while, but then becomes \"unresponsive\" and needs to be reset and reconfigured again. Annoying.\n41#Cumple lo que dice. Hasta ahora las luces han trabajado muy bien, las uso con mi Alexa y funcionan a la perfección, las recomiendo\n42#Gran producto. Lo instale en mi casa sin ayuda , solo tuve que bajar los tacos y seguir en diagrama dentro de la caja, gran funcionalidad\n43#Great price met great deal and birthed happiness for the household! Clean look, easy install(to the ones whom regularly play with electricity), lovely price and wonderful app to control. I never wanted to be “that” guy but… How many of us have laid down and realized, the dang light?!? Yeah! That was the ultimate reason right there! Had a kid laying on my chest and all I could do was take it and sleep with the lights on… Not anymore😎\n44#Easy enough. The switches install like any other, but you must have a neutral wire. I was replacing very old X10 switches, so I already had a neutral at each location. Setup was a little more complicated than I thought, mostly because Google imposed its will and completed without any Alexa setup. But once I figured it out, the second one took no time at all.\n45#TP-Link Tapo - Interruptor de luz inteligente.
