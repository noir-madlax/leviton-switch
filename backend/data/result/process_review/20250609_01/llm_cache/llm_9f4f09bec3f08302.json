These light switches are supposed to have a light on then when the switch is off. Out of all the ones I ordered 2 of them actually has a light that works\n1#Locator light very dim. I purchased this switch for my interior garage light. I bought it for the locator light built into the switch -- so I could find the switch when entering garage when its dark. It was easy to install, seems good quality, yet the light is very dim -- hardly visible at all.\n2#Nice touch. Considering buying a few more to match my other old switches.\n3#Lutron CA-1PSNL-WH. Real easy to install. Only wish the locator light was a little brighter.\n4#cant see. Does not give off hardly ANY LIGHT- get the LEVITON\n5#Very Disappointed! I'm very disappointed. This switch does not illuminate like shown/described. I was anticipating the one half section to illuminate in a nice, soft clean light. This was not what I was wanting. Buyer beware! Not worth the cost\n6#Can bearly see the light. Save your money not worth it.\n7#Great product. Lutron switches are a bit more expensive, but they seem to fit better.\n8#Measure voltage after install. Had to return. Would let 64v bleed through when off. Very frustrating. Returned and bought different brand local for $2. This is overpriced and underperforming.\n9#No light leakage! No afterglow with LED lightbulbs. Great indicator light.\n10#don't buy it for the light. \"locator light\" ??? so dim it is a joke, works fine as a switch.\n11#Bleeds current when off. This switch bleeds current to the lights when it is off. Your lights will glow when they are supposed to be unpowered. I am using dimmable LED lights. Lutron's fix for this is you should buy a nine dollar capacitor and wire it in parallel with the switch. Perhaps engineering should fix their product to not cause ghosting. They should offer a recall and not charge you an extra nine dollars to fix it yourself.\n12#This lutron switches are now being sold in little boxes rather than tough sealed plastic. The Amazon delivery person did a good delivery and was respectful of the property. The sender however, sent me an item which I found after opening the Amazon packaging, to have the original products box torn open. The item, a wall switch seemed undamaged, but exposed. It looks like it will function, but I don't know if it will do so properly, until I have had the time to install and test it. Lutron makes what I feel are some awesome switches, so I feel it should work out just fine .\n13#Lighted switch. This one was install on a 3 gang rework box. Works perfect\n14#Works, but old ones were MUCH better. Easy to install, these new switches are a bit louder when turning on/off than the ones I have from like 10 or 15 years ago. The biggest drawback is the light locator. The old switches had a decently bright, but not too bright orange light that lit up most of the \"on\" side of the paddle switch. The new one sucks! The light is MUCH smaller like a little bar of light, located in the middle of the paddle and is so dim I can barely see it unless looking straight on. I put this around the corner from a door in a bedroom above a little alcove where a desk sits. I am afraid the light locator won't be able to be seen hardly at all from the side once I put the desk back. May have to swap this one with a much brighter older one from another room. VERY disappointed. How is it they redesigned this and SCREWED IT UP? The original models worked great. I won't be paying extra (i think it is more than double the cost of a standard paddle switch) for a feature that doesn't really work.\n15#light is a joke! Nice switch but the light is so dim that it can barely be seen in a completely dark room.\n16#Luiron. The name to go to if you want quality products that last from the casita line to the basic switches and duplex outlets\n17#dim light. night light was old technology - neon bulb i think- very dim work at a fair price but like a brighter light\n18#Sturdy, clicky, lighted switch. I bought several of these switches in white to use in the bedrooms. The switches seem well constructed and sturdy. In comparison to the lit switches from Cooper and Leviton, these switches have the loudest click (snap) when toggling on and off. It was the first thing my wife noticed as she heard me testing it from the next room. Not a deal breaker, but something to be aware of. It sounds louder in person than in the video. Surprisingly, to me, the illumination is at the center of the toggle switch rather than in the center of the upper portion for On. The other brands position the lighting in the \"normal\" place. The lit spot is a smaller rectangle band rather than a larger square on the others. The lighting color is the same warm amber/dim orange on all three brands.\n19#Five Stars. Highly recommended.\n20#Switch light is super dim. Works fine as a switch, but the screw down contacts didn't have square washers to help hold the wires in place and the light inside the switch is super dim. I included a pic of it in the dark (on the left) next to the illuminated garage door opener button.\n21#Easy to install and very positive and satisfying snap action. Easy to install and very positive and satisfying snap action. The light in it doesn't seem as bright as my other Lutron switches but they are a different model with the dimmer sliders so perhaps that comes with the lower price. Overall great switch though.\n22#Five Stars. Works as expected.\n23#Quality but not as bright as I’d like... Quality switch but I wish the locator light was just a bit brighter and placed at the top of the switch (where you’d turn it on) rather than in the center.\n24#Five Stars. Perfect for my job\n25#Hreat. I thought it came with the faceplate as well\n26#After installing very dim light is on in the off ... After installing very dim light is on in the off position. The light is too dim hardly see it in the dark bathroom.\n27#Top quality switch. These Lytton switches are better than other brands. When you reach for this switch you find a high quality, sturdy product that gives you a satisfying \"click\" upon activation. Other popular switches feel flimsy to me, and I worry that they would fail under frequent use. One caveat about this Lutron: if you are looking for the night light feature to serve as you primary means of wayfinding in a darkened bathroom, this may not be for you. The button is illuminated, but just barely.\n28#Five Stars. worked great\n29#Five Stars. Nice product !\n30#Five Stars. Great product, better price then the big box stores.\n31#Doesn't work well without a grounding wire. My original single pole switches worked well without a grounding wire (not available). If you try to use this switch without one, the lights will always stay on but very dimly. I assume it's because there's a high resistance path to ground through the active and load sides to power the dim light on the switch.\n32#Look light! Its a light switch. Nothing special. I only dinged one star as it clicks quite loudly. Not sure if they make a silent one?\n33#It works. It works great. Easy to install. Instructions are clear plus calling Lutron for support was simple and the agent understood my question and pointed me in the right direction.\n34#a happy wife is worth a few extra dollars. These are a big hit with my wife. She has difficulty seeing in very low light. The glow of the light in the switch has solve her problem. As for me, a happy wife is worth a few extra dollars, for the light switch. She has a need for two other locations. Amazon alert the shipping department.\n35#Another Clean Looking Lutron Product. This is a simple single pole switch in the Diva design. We have various Lutron switches throughout our house and love how clean and elegant they are.\n36#Five Stars. Good product.\n37#Excellent! Safe, reliable, illuminated when off. Can't ask for more.\n38#Five Stars. excellent quality and excellence shipping\n39#Lighted switches. I bought these to replace Leviton lighted switches that literally fell apart, they all broke at the pivot point of the paddle, this all happened after about two years of use. The lutron switches are much better made and that's just my opinion anyhow they're still working.\n40#Somewhat stiff click action, very dim \"locator light\". I bought several different illuminated switches through my spouse's Amazon Prime account. I wanted to determine which best fit my needs before buying enough to do the whole house. This switch is illuminated when off, single pole (only 1 switch in the circuit, not a 3- or 4-way), has decent quality construction and materials, but it's made in Korea, not the USA. This switch was simple and easy to install. The body is not large so it'll fit in older, small electrical boxes. It does NOT need a neutral wire as some other lighted switches do. This may be a plus if you have an older home with no neutral wire in your existing switch box, but current building codes require new construction to have a neutral wire to allow using the fancy switches available now that do require a neutral to operate properly. For my purposes, this switch is much too dim. I wanted one that made it easy to find in the dark. At 60+ years old, my eyes could barely see the light on this switch. The light is centered on the rocker and is probably a neon bulb which should last about a dozen years. My experience with neon bulbs in switches is that the bulbs begin to flicker, then fail, after a decade or so. Another illuminated switch I bought (from a big blue box store), the Cooper C7511, is equally dim (if not even dimmer), and 25% cheaper. Bottom Line: recommended only if you have young eyes or need a very dim lighted switch for, say, a bedroom. Otherwise, look elsewhere (like Leviton).\n41#Good. This was a good purchase. Night indicator is also convenient.\n42#Had to return. Sadly the electrician would not install as said they are not compliant in Canada .\n43#Does exactly what I wanted. Quite happy with the switch. The only thing is that the light could be a little bit more visible for me.\n44#Works great. The little locator lights, are awesome. Makes it really easy to find the light switch in the dark\n45#Needs more prominent LED locator light. Works fine but the locator light is so small it is barely visible from the side. You have to be looking at it head on. Sort of defeats the purpose of a locator light if you need a light to locate the locator light 😊\n46#Five Stars. Quality switch with night light!",
