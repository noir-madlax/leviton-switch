After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Slide Control Dimmer Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Slide Control Dimmer Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment. Include all mentioned reasons, or \"?\" if none can be inferred. <USE_REASON> and <USE> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- <PHYSICAL>/<PERF> and <DETAIL> MUST NOT include:\n  * Generic statements without details (e.g., \"good\", \"bad quality\")\n  * Issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., \"fast shipping\", \"delivery time\")\n- If a review mentions any physical aspect, related performance, or use together, extract them as separate entries under \"phy,\" \"perf,\" and \"use,\" with no overlap.\n- Make sure each <DETAIL> is under the most relevant <PHYSICAL> or <PERF> in the context of Slide Control Dimmer Switches\n- Preserve negations\n\nKey Instructions:\n- Break down reviews with multiple aspects, performances, or uses into individual entries.\n- Escape special characters with backslash that could cause JSON syntax errors.\n- Include only explicitly mentioned reasons, and use \"?\" where no reason is mentioned.\n\nFinal Checklist:\n- Go through all reviews and ensure that no aspect, performance, use, or reason is omitted, even if only mentioned once.\n- Review all entries to ensure proper separation between aspects, performances, and uses.\n\nPrint the JSON result only.\nInput format:\n<ID>#<review>\n\n[[INPUT]]\n0#They dim. I bought four of these but had to return one as it did not dim except for periodically but even then only after a long delay. I’ve also noticed a second dimmer dims also with something of a lag but hardly noticeable and so I won’t change it.\n1#Easy to switch colors and install. This arrived in perfect condition, with three options for color swaps on the face- white, light almond and tan. Changing to face was a breeze, just snap it together. The whole unit is well made from a trusted brand, and my electrician is currently installing this in my new office without issue. Highly recommend.\n2#Updated old. Looks so much better works great easy to exchange with old ones\n3#Idk about this one. I ended up purchasing three of these for one switch. The first one was from Warehouse deals and it was the wrong item sent. Someone replaced the switch with a cheaper one and returned it. The second one I paid full price for and when I got it installed it blew up and started smoking. (Didn’t blow the breaker) The third one I got from my local Lowes. It works great and I got the project finished. I typically trust Amazon but Warehouse deals has been shotty lately.\n4#works great. Easy to install and looks good\n5#Great for LED Lights. Excellent replacement dimmer. Works perfectly with dimmable LEDs.",
