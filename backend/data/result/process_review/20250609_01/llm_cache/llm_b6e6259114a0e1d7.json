Important install tips for this item: If you like to have the LED light on, when you turn on the switch. Connect the LED light side toward to device direction. The no LED light side connects to the plug direction. . If you want the LED light ALWAYS ON, then connect the LED light toward the plug direction. There is a connect hole under the connect screw head. Don’t need to wrap the wire around the connect screw. Just insert the wire into the hole then tighten up the screw. This is very user friendly and easy.\n1#Very sturdy and assembly was easy. Easy to assemble and use -- Not like those hard to grip \"Roller type switches -- Sturdy hardware -- Nice led \"ON\" indicator -- I used for switching my soldering iron on and off --Also useful for under cabinet LED lighting -- Table lamp lighting -- Fan power control -- Led light strip. power -- Highly recommend .\n2#Adapted well. It was an add onto a under counter lighting system\n3#In line switch. It works very well but had to glue it to the wall no screw holes in back to mount\n4#Works great! Used to add a physical On/Off switch to a mini iron that didn't have a switch, only a temperature control (it was on as soon as you plugged it in)\n5#Easy to install; love the red indicator light. Used this switch on a hanging light bulb / china ball in a closet that has no electricity. I installed it right on the lamp cord, which already had a thumb switch, but very close to the bulb, where I couldn't reach it. *** Please note: Directions are on the product page - they don't send directions in the package. If you have never installed a switch like this before, make sure you read the directions and watch a few videos online. :) Prior to buying this switch, I was using a cube switch, which was cumbersome and often fell off. I had to keep taping it to the door jamb. *Indicator Light* this switch has an indicator light. You can install it two ways; depending on the direction you install it, the indicator light either a. stays on all the time, or b. turns on when the light is turned off. I love being able to see the switch. My closet is completely dark otherwise. Highly recommend. It's attractive and does the job.\n6#nice switch. Replaced the awkward rotary switch I has. this is much better, a sleek appearance and nice on/off feel!\n7#Works as described. Good compact switch\n8#Work great. Added these switches inline of LED strip light in garage over workbench. Work great. No issues with installation or use.\n9#Words exactly as described, would buy again. Words exactly as described, would buy again.\n10#Nice switch. Works well for my lamp and feels like a good quality\n11#Fits a 16 gauge wire. Very easy to install, took about two minutes. Fit the 16 gauge wire on my hanging lamp perfectly. Thanks to the guy who mentioned it in the reviews!\n12#Lighted in-line switch. Pleased with quality. Fast shipping.\n13#Great Switches! These are super nice heavy duty inline switches.\n14#Wrll desighed, worked out great! Good quality. Liked everything about these. Need very small screwdriver to take out screws.\n15#Easy to use but no strain relief. Easy to use but the switches do not have any strain relief feature.\n16#The switch worked great! The item was very easy to install worked great!\n17#Good Switch. Once I figured out the procedure to attach wires inside the switch all was great. (no instructions with switch). So, when you go to connect wires inside the switch, strip the wires back about 1/4\". Don't try to wrap the wire around the screw head, just back the screw almost all the way out and insert the stripped wire in under the screw and tighten the screw. Wow was that easy! Switch works great and it even has an \"ON\" pilot light. Would buy again.\n18#It looks great where I need it to be. I like how it works in a tight spot\n19#worked. work as necessay\n20#Makes turning on/off very convenient. The hanging lamp I used it for had to be inplugged to turn it off--very inconvenient. So this little inline switch solved the problem. It was easy to install.\n21#Exactly what I was looking for. For some electric cords going to test boards where it was a pain to constantly have to get up and plug them in for power and unplug them momentarily whenever making changes, these are the ticket I needed;. Easy to install on the cords. No wrap-around required. Wires held by compression screws. Nice to have indicator lights to remind then the switch is turned on, too.",
