Smooth and super easy to use. No flickering. I love them!\n1#Slim dimmers. I have 4 dimmers in one box. Regular size dimmers did not fit- but Love these slimmer dimmers…. They all fit very nicely..\n2#Slim led dimmer. Compact, work great with led recessed lights, no flickering\n3#Poor choice. Worst dimmers Every one flickering And one falling\n4#Arrived unusable. Right out of the box, only one in six worked, the other 5 caused our lights to flicker. We replaced them with higher quality dimmer switches and now no flickering. Would not recommend\n5#A little tricky to install, but they work well. Not the simplest install but they work well. Make sure you adjust the dimmer with the tiny side switch after installing as it is hidden once the cover plate is replaced.\n6#faulty switches. Half of the switches flicker.\n7#Severe flashing. Installed 5 of these dimmers, each with no more than 35 watts led . After just a couple weeks use, two of them began to flash.\n8#Work great. Installed these all over my house and they work great. price is great, home depot has 1 for 26 dollars.\n9#3 out of 12 have failed in less than 3 months. I think Amazon should take this product down. Lights start blinking at different brightness settings. 3 out of 12 failed in 3 months. It must be cheap components.\n10#worked great for almost 2 weeks. dimmer stopped working with 2 small led bulbs. the dimmers were great until they weren't\n11#they flicker and can't adjust. terrible quality. I replaced with another better known company\n12#There were 6 switches, only 3 are working. Other 3 are broken. Half of the switches are broken\n13#Just as good as $30 ones! Excellent dimmer…adjuster is flawless. Saved $20 per item compared to name brand.\n14#good quality. easy to install\n15#Easy Install. Nice looking works great.\n16#Function well. It’s east to install and it’s functioning well\n17#garbage, you get what you pay for. two of them burnt out already, you get what you pay for, waste of money\n18#Low cost for low quality. All six were faulty. Flickering, inconsistent energy flow, lights cutting on and off. You get what you pay for.\n19#Best Deal. Overall this is a good deal for a pack of dimmer switches that work as good as any I have used. Installation seemed standard, dimmer switches are always tighter than a regular switch and these compare to any other dimmer switch. There is an internal knob that allows you to adjust the brightness of the actual dimmer so the switch does not go too dim to the point that the light turns off. This is not my favorite style switch because it doesn’t quite match the standard toggle or rocker switch, but it works great and is the best deal I found at the time.\n20#Works well. Works well. Still have some problems with turning on the light when it’s in a low dim setting but that could be because of the lightbulbs that we have in the chandelier.\n21#Perfect dimmer switch. Love the option to use dimmer feature. Excellent light switches.\n22#Could be a faulty box but I did not like them. Did not work properly once installed. Had my recessed lighting fixtures flickering in between high and low\n23#Prone to Light Flickering. I love the thinness of these dimmers. They fit nicely in crowded electrical boxes and have light intensity settings to control how much to dim. Unfortunately, 4 out of the 12 I have caused severe light flickering and had to replace them. For that reason, I can't give more than 2 stars.\n24#Non satisfaite. Je suis très déçu du résultat mes lumières scintilles toujours lorsque je baisse l’intensité. Je peux à peine baisser pour avoir une lumière constante. D’une fois à l’autre c’est jamais pareille\n25#Lights don't flicker when switch turned on. Needed a dimmer that would fit in a shallow box. Limited choice of dimmers available and some LED lights flicker using other brands. This dimmer works well.\n26#Déconseille / I will never recommend. Après un mois d'utilisation, 10 de mes 12 interrupteurs sont défectueux ou non fonctionnel.\n27#Les lumières scintillent sur les 3 voies. Le produit est bon sauf pour les 3 voies, les lumières scintillent lorsque l'on diminue l'intensité au plus bas..\n28#Works well. Easy install, works well so far\n29#Fragil. Fragile don’t short them\n30#Might work well with incandescent but not with LED. Might work well with incandescent but not with LED\n31#Garbage. 2 of the 6 didn’t work. Amazon offered a $15 credit\n32#Great for the price. They were easy to install. Put in 12 of them and no problems. When they flickered there was an adjustment, and voila no flickering.\n33#Very poor - only useable as on/off. You get what you pay for. Dim range is non existant, lites flicker, they don't really dim. Tried on multiple rooms / bulbs. Got Leviton and they work as expected. Full dim range, no flicker.",
