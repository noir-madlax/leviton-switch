Poor quality. Was not functioning after installation. Sent this back\n1#Excellent product. I bought this one to replace an older \"incandescent only\" switch and this switch did not disappoint (works on LEDs and other bulbs)\n2#LED lights still flicker. I bought this because my family room lights flicker after converting to leds. I assumed the dimmer switch was the problem so bought this one because the description said it was for led lights. Still flickers on low settings. I just spent money and time to make things just like it was to start with. Great idea if all you want is experience changing out devices.\n3#Easy setup. Inexpensive. Back was not as large as some similar dimmers so it fit in box more easily.\n4#A dimmer that comes in Light Almond. It's hard to find toggle dimmers compatible with LEDs that come in light almond. These match the rest of my switches, can be used in a three way configuration, and have a trim dial to help with LEDs and CFLs. I have installed two of these one on LED can retrofits on my porch (the switch is indoors) and one on an LED island light in the kitchen. The rest of these are for LED can retrofits in the basement. Also, they have back wire (not back-stab, back wire). I love back wire. Easy, easy, easy to swap switches in the future without cutting more copper.\n5#You'll never believe this s... It's like all my other light switches, but it dims them. The build and functionality meet expectations. You wouldn't expect this to not be name brand. I'm not rating this for it's dynamic range or anything, mostly because I don't care that much. Worth the buy imo\n6#Dimming. Works well just doesn't dim enough for what I was expecting and wanting\n7#Flickers. 14 x 8 watts = 112 watts, well below the 300 watt rating for LEDs. Immediate flickering at every level. I have seen this before in other installations with different dimmers and LEDs. The solution is to replace one of the LEDs with a lumen-equivalent incandescent bulb. Took out one of the 8 watt LEDs and replaced it with a 50 watt incandescent bulb. Flickering gone. I have no idea why this works, but it always does. I gave it four stars because this is not uncommon, and I have no reason to believe that purchasing a different brand of LED dimmer would be any better.",
