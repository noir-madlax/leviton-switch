Cool! Works great! as expected... I use it for a large fan for finer speed control...\n1#Nice dimmer switch. Mfr has reversed plug orientation. Update: I use this with a strip of low voltage, dimmer-compatible, under-cabinet LED lights. The lights will occasionally, not frequently, blink (off-on) when controlled by this switch. This isnâ€™t related to any other load kicking in or anything like that. Iâ€™ve only used this switch in the lower half of its range so donâ€™t know if the problem would occur throughout the dimmer range. I missed the return/exchange cutoff date, so I am living with it, which isnâ€™t hard as it doesnâ€™t hamper the work thatâ€™s being illuminated. Could be a flaw in just this particular unit, and I still like the switch. Originally: This is a nice, smoothly operating dimmer switch. I like the large rotary knob. I am using it with under cabinet LED light bars, and the switch seems to vary the light intensity over the entire range, 10-100% according to the light's manual, in a linear fashion. Funny thing, thoughâ€”when I chose this unit I was happy to see from product photos that the neutral (wide) blade of the switch was on the right. This mean that for most electrical outlets, at least in the U.S., the switch would have to be plugged in upside down, with the receptacle for the device the switch was controlling pointing up. Some reviewers remarked that this was unfortunate, but for my application it was perfect. Now that I have the switch, I see that the manufacturer has reversed the plug orientation, probably in response to criticism, which probably will make 90 percent of customers happy. I opened the unit to see if the plug orientation could be easily reversed, but that does not seem to be the case. (I think that would be a cool feature to have. I now see that a diagram and a customer photo on the product page does show this wide-blade-on-the-left orientation, but as of this date the seller's product photos and videos still show the opposite.) So, I will be turning the receptacle in my outlet box over (for those who don't know, the electrical code does not specify that for households the orientation of receptacles has to be any specific way) so I can use this nice dimmer switch upside down, the way that will work better for me.\n2#Nice dimmer. Would buy again. Just as described and works great dimming the light in my curio. No more having to open the door of the cabinet, rattling my precious contents, to find and turn the light on.\n3#Works perfectly. Works perfectly. I am using it to dim a portrait light.\n4#Lasted 32 days. Worked for just over a month, just enough time to not be able to be returned. ðŸ‘Ž\n5#exactly what we needed, works perfectly. Wanted to dim the edison bulb lamp in our bathroom to use as a nightlight. This works perfectly, and it's awesome to have the option to make it brighter when needed.\n6#Disappointing. It stopped working after a year\n7#Smooth operation, clean design. This is perfect for us as it has a simple dial that can click to off or else adjust smoothly toward brightness without extraneous wire or attachments.\n8#Works perfectly! Bought a floor lamp that I love the design of. It came with built-in LED lightbulbs that were way too bright. This dimmer plug was exactly what I needed.\n9#Flickers at high power. Nice product for controlling older non 3-way lamps . Have several. Down side is thatâ€™s it tends to flicker at full power, but works well at other settings.\n10#Scary Noised/Doesnâ€™t work. Makes scary noises, doesnâ€™t din the light\n11#Did not work on my stove fan. Small \"squirrel cage\" fan - draws 75W/130VAR on low - and would not run at any setting on the knob. It was possible at the highest setting - if you were very careful - to get it to run - like a sweet spot on the dial. But that was intermittent and any other position would not work. It did power up a small table fan and worked fine for that. My other comment - has no ground - only 2 prong - so if you have a 3 prong plug you will have to get a \"cheater\" plug. My stove fan had 3 prongs - and even if it had worked I would have had some concerned about it.\n12#Works. Did what I needed. Used to slow fan speed down.\n13#Worked great dimming the lights on my Christmas Tree!! Worked great dimming the lights on my Christmas Tree!! The lights were so bright you couldn't see the ornaments. Now I can adjust to a nice pleasing brightness by simply turning the knob.\n14#Failed. I bought this to control a small fan I use to blow air out of a heater vent in family room. It worked fine for a few days and now stopped working.\n15#Letâ€™s you dim whatever you plug into it. Simple and does what you want it to do!\n16#Worked perfect! Couldn't be happier! I'm seriously impressed with these dimmers! I recently took on a project where I built a false stud wall with sconces for a video studio. The goal was to create some stylish back lighting without the hassle of wiring in traditional dimmer switches. That's where these dimmers came into play, and let me tell you, they were a game changer. I simply wired the lights behind the wall to a plug and connected them to this switch. The setup was a breeze â€“ no complicated wiring, no permanent alterations, just straightforward, effective lighting control. It's the perfect blend of simplicity and functionality. For anyone looking to add a touch of adjustable lighting without the usual fuss, these dimmers are the way to go!\n17#Works good. Works as it should for my small fan.\n18#Wow! what a dimmer! I use this inside a bathroom fan to tone it done and make it quieter. It worked very well. Such an easy fix. Thank you.\n19#Perfect. Perfect for reducing the speed of the fan\n20#Wanted greater light dimming. The product did not dim the light enough. I expected it would dim it gradually to zero. Only dimmed 25%\n21#Perfect Solution. Wanted to be able to dim the light over my dining table. I rent so did not want to get into the apartment electrics. Perfect solution, inexpensive, simple install and removable. The dimmer itself works great. Adjustment of brightness from on/min to max is very linear.\n22#Works........for now. Used this on a cheapy fan...to take it down a liitle. When you buy that $15.95 fan, and even on low it howls and vibrates, get one of these to slow it down. So far so good.....will update as time goes on.\n23#Very nice dimmer. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this dimmer. It works very well. The price is more than reasonable. So, if you are on the fence on buying it, hop over to the purchase side of the fence!\n24#Great dimmer for electric control. The Aiwode Rotating Dimmer Switch worked well for my needs. I used it for dimming lights and it does that great. It's very small and easy to use too. Would recommend.\n25#Low Voltage. The size, shape, and orientation of the dimmer was unbelievably perfect for the intended application - a single halogen puck light fixture. Unfortunately the maximum output of the dimmer I received is a measurable 10 volts lower than the input voltage. The light output of the fixture it is associated with is just that much less because of the low voltage. I can't rate this item any higher because the only use of this item is predicated by it's electrical properties and not its shape nor form.\n26#It was just what I needed for a new hanging light. Plug and play!!\n27#Great product. Great product for the money\n28#Works Great! I have tried a number of fancier and pricier versions and none of them worked. This works great - so happy to have finally hit paydirt! Thank you for making a great product!\n29#I am not impressed with this device. This device does not work with energy saving bulbs (LED). It also doesn't work with the grow light. It only works with light bulbs that are Dimmable - Light Bulbs. Somehow it works strangely as if it reduces the voltage by 1/4 when turning. So if you expect to get smooth scrolling it won't happen. For example, if you connect a fan, you will not be able to set the speed you want, but it will go from about 25% 50% 75%. Note that you need special bulbs that are compatible and will allow you to set them to some 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% light. I am not impressed with this device.\n30#Works pretty well. Tested with regular (non LED) light bulbs. It works fine, although it doesn't dim fully before switching off, ie. it allows you to dim between about 10% through100% brightness.\n31#Simple, small dimmer for lamps and small appliances. DESCRIPTION This item is a general purpose dimmer for loads up to 200 Watts. â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” ASSEMBLY Plug your appliance into the dimmer, and plug the dimmer into an outlet. â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” PLUS Simple and easy to use. Small size. There is an OFF setting with a definite click sound so you are sure the load is off. When turned down all the way, the lamp is still on a little, so you can tell it is still on. â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” MINUS The dimmer is upside-down (the outlet is on the top) when I plug it into my outlets. My outlets are oriented the usual way with the ground pin on the bottom. The marking around the dial is two arrows, which is not the usual convention. I expected one gradually-increasing crescent to indicate more power. The indicator on the knob is a shallow groove and not too visible. I improved upon this by using a black Sharpie pen to make a line in the groove. â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” HOW I USED IT I wanted a device to use with my hot pot, to reduce the heat to a simmer level. My hot pot has two power levels, 200W and 700W. Both levels boil water too much for simmering. I put some soup ingredients in the hot pot, set it for low (200 Watts), and plugged it into the dimmer. I turned the dimmer up all the way for the full 200 Watts. Once the soup began to boil, I backed the dimmer down to halfway. This simmered the soup nicely, with only an occasional bubble popping to the surface. Perfect! I also tried the dimmer on several lamps and it works as advertised. â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” MY RATING 5 stars for doing its job well.\n32#Works great. Using this for a small light strip; it works great and is easy to use.\n33#Polarity reversed. The polarity on this product is reversed. Consequently, you have to plug the unit in upside down with any appliance cords coming out of the top. Very inconvenient. If the polarity was reversed, the product would be good.\n34#Works well for low-wattage incandescent lamps, some LEDs. I knew when i got this that it was designed for low current applications (no heaters or high wattage items) and it works well for what it's designed for. When used with a lamp having an incandescent bulb, it dims nicely to about 20% then goes dark. I wish it could dim lower but it's adequate. I also tried it with an LED rope light and it worked similarly; I was surprised because LEDs prefer PWM-style dimmers, not voltage dimmers, so presumably it has to do with the rope light's ability to handle it.\n35#Upside down, doesnt dim fully. The prongs are backwards so in most outlets has to be plugged in upside down. The dimmer only dims about 50% before it clicks to off so no option to have a very subtle light.\n36#Compact, useful variable voltage unit. Compact, useful variable voltage unit. Minimum out put voltage 38 Vac to 50 Vac per instructions, and minimum load is 5 watts. Firm on/off switch, built into dial. No ground\n37#Prone to breaking. Used for a few months during 2024 Christmas then. It became faulty â€¦ now I need a soldering iron (80W) power controller and it doesnâ€™t work. Low Quality control product. Buyers be aware!\n38#Dimmer. Works great!!\n39#Bad quality. It didnâ€™t work probably\n40#pas fonctionnel. Il n'Ã©tait pas fonctionnel. Probablement eu rÃ©sistant.\n41#Works great. Does exactly what I wanted\n42#Died quickly. Used it on my 100w lava lamp and it lasted a few weeks\n43#Stopped working after 1 month. Great little product, love the functionality, but it literally stopped working the day after the return window closed. Iâ€™ll have to buy a better quality replacement.\n44#Perfect for lamp. Great product. Not good for fan. It works but fan motor has a buzzing noise.\n45#Ne convient pas Ã  certains ventilateurs. TrÃ¨s bonne qualitÃ© de produit. Cependant et malheureusement, mon ventilateur Ã©mettait un bourdonnement lorsque le rhÃ©ostat n'Ã©tait pas au maximum. J'ai dÃ» le retourner...\n46#Not suitable for led bulb. Not suitable for led bulb.\n47#Exactly what was I looking for. After 4 months still working ok, no flicker even on min range. Advised\n48#It works on the right bulb. Gets the job done, simple to use, but as others have mentioned you have to have a set up that can handle different dimmings, if you use this with a standard lamp it will just act as an off on switch.\n49#Broke after a couple days. Same thing as another customer. Bought the thing, used it to dim incandescent christmas tree lights. It worked great!! Only for 2 days though. It now doesn't work, spinning the dial the lights sometimes flicker. But it doesn't do anything else. Lame",
