Easy to install and provides the perfect amount of light to use a small bathroom in the middle of the night.\n1#Great Switch. Purchased the Leviton 6526-W switch back in 2019, and finally installed in 2023. Easy install and it worked great. My wife is pleased, so all is good. BTW: If the led lights do not function; switch the two black wires. The two led lights provide adequate night lighting in the dining room. Thanks to Amazon for such a great deal. A+\n2#Just a night light. It only work as a switch with a light glowing at dark. It will not control the appliance base on the environment light.\n3#Perfect amount of light. I use this as a guide light in my bathroom and it gives off just the right amount of light that I don't have to turn on the overhead light, but not so bright that my eyes have to readjust.\n4#lights up the night. lights up the night, makes finding light switch easy, need extra wire to install but not a big deal\n5#it's a switch. Not as bright as I thought it would be, but works.\n6#No problems so far with bulb life. I have 3 of these now, some dating back awhile. So far, I have seen no degradation of the bulb brightness, so I am confident enough to buy additional units where needed. The brightness in my opinion is just a little lacking, but it is adequate to find your way in the middle of the night. There is a third connection which must go to the white neutral wire to get the light to come on. Check your outlet box prior to ordering to see if white wires are present. Sometimes, they are not available in switch boxes. There is also a ground connection which you should attach to the bare ground wires. Although not technically correct, if you attach the bare ground wires to the neutral (white) terminal, the led will light. This is not to code however. Another workaround is to connect the non-hot wire going to the device to the neutral terminal, and depending on the device connected, this may provide enough ground to power the light but only when the switch is in the off position. (for example, an incandescent light bulb will have a low enough resistance to provide a return path when switch is in the off position only.\n7#Night light not bright enough even in the dark. This is a great brand. I use their products all the time in my handyman business for customers but this particular switch/light does not have enough light output.\n8#Great night light with a switch. I have installed these in all my bathrooms on my fan switch, that way when you are trying to find the bathroom or light switch it's super easy. I highly recommend these switches!\n9#It didn't work for me. The nightlight portion didnt work at all. My light was wired with hot on the white and load out on black. Not sure if this is why it didn't work, but packaging should indicate you need a dedicated neutral.\n10#Great Light. I put this in our bathroom so as not to need to turn a light on in the middle of the night. My particular location also has an exhaust fan so it was a little trial and error to figure out which wires were needed and which were not. Always use a professional if you're not sure. Puts out great light in a dark room!\n11#Works well, does what is says. Had Leviton 5631-2W 20-Amp, switched to this model and like the lower brightness of this switches guide line. Also has light sensor so is not on during day. Used in attic application, no more having to do the blind \"slide hand along wall until you find it\" dance.\n12#Decora wall switch with nightlight installed. Works as described. I installed it in a dark garage to control an outside light. You can see in my picture that I wrote the word \"ON\" under the switch on the right side as a reminder because the light it controls is located outside of the garage/not visible from the switch area, and I'm used to switches toggling up/down not left/right. The nightlight in the switch is not as bright as some of those adjustable rounded nightlights that plug into an electric outlet, but the light in this switch does glow enough to dimly light the immediate area near it in the garage, which is certainly better than total darkness. When on, you can see the 2 little LEDs located behind that whitish plate at the top of the switch, and they create a soft glow. (In the picture the light looks very bright in the dark, but in person it's more of a soft glow.) For my particular needs I wish it was brighter, but it's probably the perfect brightness for a bathroom switch for people who wake up in the middle of the night and don't want to turn on the bright bathroom lights. Installation was easy for me; I'm not an electrician. Some wall switches have little holes you can simply push the rigid wires into then the wires are automatically clamped into place, but this switch does not have those so you must wrap the electric wires around the screws. The screws are colored: brass screw by itself on one side of the switch for the black hot wire that is supplying power into the switch, on the other side of the switch is another brass screw for the black load wire that sends power out to the item being controlled (my outside light) then a silver screw for the white neutral wire, then a green screw for the ground wire. You must have a white/neutral wire for this switch/nightlight to work properly. If you do not know how to safely tell the difference between the 2 black wires (one is the hot wire that always has power to it; the other carries power to the item the switch controls) then I suggest you seek help...safety first as always. The instructions that are included in the box with this switch are good and have much more detail than I listed here.\n13#Water closet low lighting. Finally solved the problem for low illumination in the water closet.\n14#Great dual purpose switch and nightlight. We really like it. It replaces a plug in nightlight in our bathroom and frees up the outlet for hair dryers and other devices. It’s plenty bright enough for us to see in the bathroom at night.\n15#Does it’s job well. Was looking for a bathroom nightlight integrated into a wall switch. This does that job well. Be sure your switch has a neutral wire as nightlight will not light without it.\n16#The Night Light Doesn't Work. The switch itself works fine but the night light feature doesn't work. It's already installed so I will keep it but it would have been nice to have been able to use the nightlight feature.\n17#Good for a night light in bedroom. Not too bright, and turns off with indirct light during the day from windows. The light is enough so that you can make out where things are at night. Dimmer is adequate. Single screw for ground, have to use a pigtail. Make sure you have hot, neutral, and ground. This wont work for hot pole only toggles, or for multiple switches on a single circuit.\n18#Very bright switch. Good switch. Wiring was a pain due to my newer home wiring had to be modified to turn on the led light.\n19#Needs a neutral wire. This product requires a neutral (white) wire to operate. Verify you have one on the particular switch you are replacing or you will waste your money/time.\n20#Functional. Works very well to illuminate the light switch when we enter the garage from the laundry room.\n21#Just right for safety. Installed in the bathroom during a renovation. Just the right amount of light for safe navigation overnight.\n22#Nice night light. Great night light for bathroom, only negative is you can see the two led lights, but the light strength is fine. Easy install if you have a neutral wire (white usually).\n23#Love it! Was getting tired of turning the fan on by mistake when I meant to hit the light. This works perfectly, and the night light is an awesome plus. Don’t need to always turn the light on now.\n24#Good quality light switch/night light. I had purchased another, similar type switch that comes in pairs, but this one is better. I wish I had purchased these to begin with because I changed out a number of light switches throughout our house. Unfortunately I used the other type for most of them. These are more expensive; one costs as much as a pair of the other type. But if you buy switches in pairs, install one, but the other is bad, what do you do? For me I'm not going to remove the good switch and return the pair, I'll just chuck the bad one. But I have not had a bad one of these so far and I have maybe 5 or 6.\n25#Nice night light switch. Was looking for something brighter than an ordinary lighted switch, and this fit the bill ! You will need to bring over a white wire to the switch to power the light, but that isn't really much of an issue if you've worked with electricity before.\n26#Harder to install, but good once working. Follow the instructions! This device needs to be hooked into a white neutral for the LED to work. The hot and the load line needs to be the correct position. Many of the one star reviews didn't get this correct so it didn't work or isn't working properly. Install was more difficult than I anticipated. Once working, this product works well. Great for bathroom light where there is no additional outlet. Light is plenty bright. Quality is good.\n27#Better than the old/orange style. I had the older style illuminated switch that glows orange. This looks so much better in my modern bathroom. Very clean looking and the perfect amount of nightlight.\n28#Still in the dark..... The switch works; it turns the light on and off. However, the night light doesn't work. At first, the night light came on when the switch was on. A day later it doesn't come on at all: day or night. I expected much better from Leviton!!\n29#Great Night Light. Easy to install and provides the perfect amount of light for the top of our basement stairs. Requires a neutral to work.\n30#Need 4 wires. Works great. Looks good\n31#Bright light. Very bright, nice addition to dark area\n32#Excellent. So glad that I purchased this. It was simple to install and works terrific. I can now find the light switch in my very dark room.\n33#Got what I was expecting... Exactly what what was advertised.\n34#Works great. I actually purchased this to go into one end of a walk-through closet, but the end I needed it on was a two way switch without a neutral so I had to put it in the laundry room instead. Now I can walk through there at night without having to turn lights on. What I really like is that I can touch this rocker switch without getting shocked on the metal faceplate screw during static winter days.\n35#Sensor not big enough. The sensor needs a lot of light to keep the night light off. I have this installed in a shower/toilet closet, right in the bathroom. There are two lights in the closet and the bathroom lights right outside the doorway. The door is always opened, but with all the lights on, the night light comes on with the slightest shading from moving around.\n36#Great value. The night light is perfect\n37#Works great! Perfect amount of light for my bathroom at night, and still able to have a switch for the shower lights.👍🏼\n38#Good nightlight/switch. Works perfectly as intended. Used in hallway where i previously had a motion installed. Changed to this as pets,etc motion would activate too much.better nightlight than getting blasted with the instant on motion.bright enough to not need to activate lights at night,but not excessively bright.\n39#Does the job. Serves the purpose.\n40#Cannot adjust the sensitivity. The only reason I took a star off is because the guide light’s sensitivity cannot be adjusted. The room has to be extremely bright in order for the light to go off. We have the light mounted in our toilet area so we don’t have to flip light switches on in the middle of the night. If the sensitivity could be adjusted this light would be rated with 6 stars.\n41#Works. Switch work great. The brightness is ok.\n42#Just right amount of light. Installed this evening and an very happy with it. Not too bright, just right for the potty closet. Overnight wifey has to flip on the big light to see where she’s going, now she’ll have just enough guiding light. Buying two more for guest bath and kids bath.\n43#A bit too bright. Nice addition and easy to install, but the LED light may be a bit too bright for bedrooms. It would be nice to have options to change the color of the light cover then the brightness may be less of an issue. For now, I am using Pot-It note to soften the default LED color.\n44#Light doesn't work. Installed today and the light doesn't work :(\n45#DO NOT TRUST A BRAND NAME OR ELSE YOU WILL WASTE OF $$$ & FEW HOURS IN YOUR LIFE. Waste of $$$ & time: products didn't work. The LED light on/off randomly with the color more likely like 3000-3500k and too dark. I cannot return them because the boxes were throw in trash can already :( . I should keep the boxes to make sure they're ok. Learn lesson: DO NOT TRUST A BRAND NAME.\n46#Night light. I really like this for our water closet that does not have a plug. It gives off just the right amount of light for a night light.\n47#Excellent night light. Excellent night light that. My bathroom has two light switches next to each other; one for the fan and one for the lights. I replaced the fan switch and it looks great! Prevents me from having to turn on a bright light to use the bathroom at night.\n48#Nightlight and a Switch. I have installed three of these nightlight switches to replace the fan switches in my bathrooms. The nightlight is powered by two 120V LEDs that are bright! No need to turn on a bathroom light in the middle of the night. For my taste, it would be better if the light cover did a better job of diffusing the light so you couldn't see the two LEDS, which are quite bright when you looked at directly. Installation is easy but did require me to add a common wire from the new switch to the other common wires in the junction box that were connected with a wire nut.",
