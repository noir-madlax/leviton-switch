Quiet switch\n1#Made in USA at a great price. Great deal on made in USA switches. I'm replacing most of the switches in our house, had been buying them from my go to home improvement store at what I thought was a good price, and these were half the price. Wish I'd found them sooner.\n2#How is this product rated so highly? This is my experience. How else can I rate a product except by personal experience? For many years, replacing a light switch was a no-brainer. Not in terms of being careless; one does not fool around with electricity (or plumbing). I mean in terms of going to the store and buying a Leviton light switch. Good quality and highly dependable. Well, I am sorry but I think something bad has happened in recent years at Leviton. In a nutshell, my experience is this: I have Leviton light switches that probably go back to when my house was new (circa 1980) and they go on and on, no problem. Never need replacing. However, with a handful of switches that did need replacing in recent years, I have needed to replace them more than once. Especially, in one case, a bathroom light switch. FOUR TIMES IN THE PAST TWO OR THREE YEARS. This is not a high-traffic area and there are no children playing with or abusing this switch. My wife and I are consciously taking it easy with this one, knowing that it keeps breaking. There is nothing in the way that it is installed that would account for it being fragile. Yet, here I was the other night, with my wife informing me that the bathroom light switch was broken again. This necessitated a trip to Home Depot which fortunately stays open until 10pm. And get this: A Home Depot employee approached me while I was looking for alternatives, offering me assistance. I asked him what in the heck is wrong with this type of Leviton light switch. \"It keeps breaking?\" he said. \"Yes,\" I said. He did not say anything else in response but he did nod his head in agreement, like it's not the first time he has heard this. My theory is, some time in the past few years, Leviton decided to go with a lower-grade of plastic in order to save money. What else would account for this repeated failure? And it's not just a bad batch; I have gone to both Ace Hardware and Home Depot over a long enough period of time with the same bad results for replacing Leviton light switches in the bathroom and two other locations in my house. Unasked, the Home Depot guy recommended that I go with a rocker type of switch instead. \"Better quality,\" was his advice. I hope so because it, too, is made by Leviton. For one thing is true: Leviton sure as heck has the local retail market sewn up. We may see alternatives here on Amazon but in places like Home Depot, Leviton is all that is available.\n3#Estético y de calidad. Cumple con su objetivo y se ve elegante.\n4#Bit disappointed... I bought 30 of these and every single one of the switches have a ding on the end of the toggle (see picture). It is definitely noticeable when the light shines on it. A bit disappointed that there is such a consistent manufacturing defect with these.\n5#Some of us still turn lights on and off when entering and leaving a room. These Leviton switches have been my go-to brand forever. Constant on and off switching has never caused them to fail. What does necessitate me purchasing in bulk is that ants get into the work boxes and cause the switches to short circuit. I put medicated cattle ear tags in the industrial type boxes where the problem occurs, but the solution eventually evaporates, and the tags lose their effectiveness. When the switch fails to turn a light on or off, I already know the cause of the problem and go for one of these replacements and my tools. I'm old school. I still like the screw terminals rather than the plug and play. Highly recommended.\n6#Item as described. Good product and fast delivery!\n7#Bargain Pack 10!/USA Made! Well done/good instructions (printed on inside of cardboard box & stamped into item itself!)--weak/spotty glue dots may not hold original box together, so consider asking for packaging that conceals the original box/will be better sealed!\n8#Good value. Works as expected worth the money\n9#Soft feel. Don’t really like these, there’s a good feel in the up position and you can feel it locking into place but down is super spongy that makes it feel like you didn’t even turn it off. I’m guessing this is what they mean by quiet? Either way I threw the other half of the pack away and will be going back to the GE ones that I have and have a nice feel up and down.\n10#The quality and price. Easy to install and nice looking\n11#Easy. A trusted brand.\n12#Good brand. and good price.\n13#Well satisfied! The product was as described. Great for the price.\n14#Exactly what I expected, basic toggle switches that work fine. These are the traditional light switches we have all been using for the last 30 years. There is a satisfying field to the toggle, construction appears to be of good quality and I would definitely recommend these switches.\n15#I got a 10-pack of lemons. I have been using Leviton products since the mid 1990s. The box I received today has a positive feel (click) switching on, but more slike a sliding dimmer switch turning off. If they didn't arrive in a sealed box, then I would think that it was worn out. My house was built in 1976 and several of the switches that appeared to be original to the house had this amount of wear. The previous owner's didn't take very good care of the house and whoever wired it took short cuts. I recently purchased Leviton hospital grade recepticles and commercial grade switches and they are outstanding. The switches I received today are defective and will not be installed. Now a rant. There are nine recpticles on one circuit down stairs. I haven't checked if they used 14-2 Romex or 12-2. That sounds like too many to me the wall is drywall on one side, but open on the other. They have 14-2 Romex out of the breaker panel hooked up to more 14-2 going into 1/2\" EMT to a recepticle then back up and over to another EMT to another recepticle back up and then upstairs to a switched recepticle to power the garbage disposal then back down to the basement to power a third recepticle. Both instances sound wrong to me. The plumbing is worse. The three stooges did better. Two of the three toilets won't flush. The one that does flows counter-clock wise. The other two flow clock wise.\n16#Everyone of them scratched and damaged. They work fine, but every single one of them is has scratches and has dings on the switch. The part that is visible when installed.\n17#Great Product. Worked very well. Would buy again.\n18#Great Value for the Price. The Leviton 1451-2WM toggle switch is a reliable and high-quality switch that is ideal for residential use. It is a single-pole switch that is rated for 15 amps and 120 volts, making it suitable for most household applications. The switch is also grounded, which helps to ensure safe and reliable operation. One of the best features of the Leviton 1451-2WM toggle switch is its durability. It is made from high-quality materials and is designed to last for many years. The switch also features a solid construction that helps to reduce the risk of damage and wear over time. The toggle switch is also very easy to install, making it a great choice for anyone who needs to replace an existing switch or install a new one. The switch comes in a 10-pack, which is a great value for the price.\n19#Product quantity missing, very upsetting. Product quantity missing, very upsetting\n20#Where manufactured and where parts originate. In March 2007, Leviton was sued in United States District Court by Lutron Electronics regarding various dimmers, switches, and wireless lighting control systems.[21][22] Lutron also filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission alleging that Leviton has produced several patent-infringing products in Mexico and China and then imported them into the United States.[23] The lawsuit was settled with a cross-license of certain of the parties' respective patents.[24]\n21#Replacement switches. Excellent seller and service. New condition.\n22#Got On Time. Great Value\n23#Great price. Fast shipping. Great price. Fast shipping.\n24#Great product. I just do not know how long the last\n25#Buy American. Never cheap out on electrical items.\n26#Excelente. Perfecta, rápida entrega y buena calidad\n27#Great buy and easy to install. Easy enough to replace old switches in house\n28#A general switch which works. It is a great regular switch for lights etc, take defective one out replace and your done. Use push in or screws your choice.\n29#Perfect affordable switch replacement. These light switches were very affordable and easy to install. Took care of my problem and saved money on hiring an electrician.\n30#Works good. It works very good and it is really cheap\n31#So smooth, so sheer, and not too thick. Never before have the lights switched on so smooth. I sometimes come home at lunch from my job just to switch the lights on and off to remind me of how good this switch is.\n32#Switch on, switch off! Lots of light switches for not a lot of money. What’s not to like? These have been easy to install and it’s always nice to have a few extra light switches laid by in case of an emergency or if you want to throw them around in a fun light switch fight. As for after they’re installed? I don’t know what I like more, turning lights on with them, or turning them off to get some shuteye. Thankfully these switches do both jobs admirably.\n33#Nationally Known Brand. Top quality and safe for home repair/replacement\n34#Amazing value! These are the best single pole switches in the industry!\n35#Made in the USA. I've used Leviton switches and outlets whenever I've had to replace existing fixtures. We are changing all the outlets & switches in our house to white, so purchased these. They work and are easy to install. I did have to use the screw posts as the holes for push installation are rated for 14 gauge wire, and most of the wiring in my house is 12. Oh, and these are made in the USA!\n36#Expected Leviton quality. Used these to replace a couple of switch that weren't operating correctly, and both have worked just fine after six weeks of use. Installation is as easy as any switch or outlet replacement is; which is to say it's not complicated but because I don't do this often it always a bit of a learning process. Didn't need ten but I now have extras.\n37#Leviton 1451-2WM 15 Amp, 120 Volt Switch. Very easy to install and fit perfectly. There are 10pcs in a box.\n38#Very nice. Great value for the money. They are nice and easy to install\n39#Good quality. Good quality good price\n40#Works as expected. GREAT VALUE. EASY TO INSTALL.\n41#Good. A-OK. Good switch. Good price. Good seller.\n42#Great. Not bad for the price\n43#Good quality. Good quality. It's soft and quiet to operate.\n44#Easy to install! Easy to use, installation was very quick and simple.\n45#Works as advertised. Works as advertised\n46#Great feel for a light switch. These are not very expensive but they are well made and well engineered. They are slim and fit right, plus they have a nice feel flipping on and off.\n47#Good value. Didn’t need it yet but I’m sure I will at some time, gave it to the wife as a birthday gift,",
