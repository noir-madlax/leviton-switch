A no-brainer. I'm a licensed electrical contractor, and these are my go to dimmer in the decorator style. They look nice, are easy to install and I have no callbacks and we have Installed hundreds of them. I don't even consider another dimmer unless I'm stepping up and then I use Diva smart dimmers.\n1#The item was as described. The switches were durable and the instructions were easy to follow.\n2#Awesome! Work as advertised! Will buy again!\n3#Good quality and works as it should. Great product, solved my flickering issue caused by my tankless water heater\n4#They work as described. Used to dim kitchen and dining room lights\n5#Easy to install. Make sure you turn the circuit breaker off before you install any electrical product\n6#Dimmer Switch for Dimmable LED. I had old switches the caused LED lights to flicker. Once I installed this switch, NO more flickering. I would definitely buy these again.\n7#Great 3 way dimmer switch. Stopped the blinking of our can lights\n8#Awesome dimmer switch. Easy to install ‚Ä¶.works perfectly\n9#Work very well. Look great üëç\n10#Work well with LED recessed lights, but wish they had a nightlight. They work well with LED recessed lights, but I wish they had a nightlight\n11#Low cost for this quality. Using these for circle lights that run low watts, I was having issues with buzzing and these fixed it perfect. Tactile and feels very quality.\n12#Great product. Works as it should. Good product from good company.\n13#Great dimmers!!! Easy to install and easy to use!!! Great quality dimmers!\n14#Lutron LED Dimming-Range Adjustment Lever is a Great Feature. I'm just a DIY homeowner who have over the years taught myself electrical stuff via books in the old days -- and now via YouTube. I purchased the subject Lutron double pack. I used both switches to replace existing single-pole switches. I used one switch to replace a cheap GE-brand LED dimmer switch which I had purchased at Wal-Mart a couple years ago. That cheap GE switch had a problem of not being able to be turned back on if it had been turned off in a low-dimmed state. This Lutron switch solved that problem with its LED Dimming-Range Adjustment Lever. (Note: The lever must be adjusted prior to putting the switch cover-plate back over the switch.) 5‚òÜ+ rating in my book. I have used Lutron electrical switches in the past and they have always proved to be reliable in my experience. Highly recommended. .\n15#Great dimmer for LEDs! Works great with LED bulbs. Stylish switch that fits and works perfectly.\n16#Some installation problems and a 20-year lifespan. I've used all different kinds of these gorgeous and highly adjustable Lutron switches (primarily exactly like these) for 25 years. And that's just about how long they last, which is a disappointment to me because the old-fashioned narrow flip on/off switches last as long as the building stands. But these new Lutron switches are built (somehow) to accommodate LED, halogen and incandescent light, all of which I have in my home. I do have a light bar that we replaced with LED bulbs and these new LED switches allowed a mind-numbing flicker of light that is so bad that I'm replacing the energy-sucking, hot incandescent bulbs there. I can only presume that the issue had something to do with the light bar of 8 bulbs but maybe it's the switch too. So caution. In replacing the worn-out, twist-prone Lutron switches with their new equally-adjustable counterparts, we've found that these switches are hard to fit into the electric boxes that were built 25-years ago. Fortunately Lutron has put sort of wings on the sides that you can break off to help you wedge the switch into the box. The problem really comes in when you have a 2-3-4 switch panel. We found it very hard to get these switches to fit in in those 2-3-4 switch panels and even harder to keep from breaking the lovely cover for the boxes. Perhaps that is why Lutron's 4-swich unit has no screws on it since aligning screws with the 4-panel is guaranteed breakage. We decided instead, since we couldn't figure out from the Amazon posting how the screwless unit was attached, that we would just glue the old cover back together and ignore the crack it left. You know these Lutron switches are about to go when (consistently) they begin to shift sideways and the contact points become erratic. Don't wait to replace; it will not stay the same or get better. It's not something you did; it's a flaw of the switch. ... But they sure make the house feel nice and for a person who is all about light, it's odd and intensity, in the end, Lutron is a dream come true..\n17#Great dimmer, solid click. I'm really happy with this dimmer. Did 4 in about an hour. Click sounds solid and firm and dimmer functions like it should. The instructions were easy to follow if you have basic experience with electricity\n18#Disappointed. Does not dim G4 LED bulbs. This dimmer switch main package and description states it dims LED bulbs but once I installed the switch I found that it does not dim G4 LED bulbs. Wasted a lot of time and full price of the switch. The instructions inside the package states it only works with screw in type LED bulbs. That information should have been on the product description as it is very important. Very disappointed with this product and the poor description that does not indicate that it only works with certain types of dimmable LED bulbs.\n19#Not dim enough. Good product, just limited on the percentage of dimness.\n20#a little noisy. Works fine. It is just a little noisy with clicking on and off.... I had others that were \"smoother\"\n21#Switches will allow LED can lights to flicker when adjusting fan control or ac kicks on. Trying to avoid dimmed strobing or flicker when adjusting fan control or other switches in same box or circuit. Also slight flicker when ac kicks on. These type seem to help the best, wondering if there is a similar switch with a built in filter to avoid issue. Also having to explain to picky homeowners on brand new homes.\n22#Switches easy to install. Good for the money\n23#Product great! Instructions terrible! This switch can be used as either a 3-way switch or a conventional single way switch. By convention, single way switches operate so that one presses the toggle on top to turn the light on and on the bottom to turn it off. If you follow the enclosed instructions for installing this switch as a single way unit you will get the reverse behavior. I used the user message board to see how to fix this even though I knew what to do from experience. The response I got was contradictory from two different \"expert\" responders. One said I should follow the instructions and I must have installed the switch upside down (this is hard to do if you are paying any attention) and the other (the correct response) was to use the red/white striped wire in place of the solid red wire as the instructions direct. This last response is the correct one. The switch works fine. Just make sure you do not follow the instructions if you want correct operation for a one way installation.\n24#Works as advertised. We had the unit installed by a professional electrician to keep the new home warranty intact. In all likelihood, it could be installed without professional help, but the cost was not prohibitive to have it done by a professional, and saves a lot of time, energy and worry.\n25#Great led dimmers. Looks great and works well!\n26#quality dimmers. no issue - quick simple install\n27#Easy to hookup. Works! Had to replace my halo dimmer because would not work with 3-way. This switch has no neutral and worked perfectly!\n28#No allowed to return due to date. Was not what electrician needed and could not return\n29#They're well built. If you know what you're doing, these will work out well for you. If not, hire a professional.\n30#ONLY ONE Work with my LED lights. This product is great. You should know, however, that only one dimmer can be installed in the circuit. I put this dimmer switch on both sides of the 3 way circuit and the light continuously flickered. I had to remove one dimmer and replace it with a standard 3way switch for the dimmer function to work properly. That was okay with me and now the dimmer function works great!!\n31#Package opened; product does not seem to work. I bought 2x of DVCL-153P-2-WH. They come with a little bag of wire nuts - both were opened and one of them was missing nuts. Thought that was strange. I am using these in a single pole application where I'm replacing existing switches. Installation was easy but they don't work. Hot to red, hot to black, ground to green. Nothing. Tried switching the hot (black) wires. Nothing. One is wired to LED downlights (which specifically listed these switches as compatible); the other is wired to LED hanging fixtures. Neither work. Installation is too easy (screw on wire nuts to 3 wires) to have messed it up... but just in case I've checked and double checked, and even switched the hot on one. Worth noting the ceiling fan on the same circuit, which I wired at the same time, works (with a normal cheap toggle switch). So it's either the installation, or the dimmers - and like I said, installation is very easy.\n32#Diva < Mastro. Diva doesn‚Äôt work for 3 way dimming. Get the mastro switch and a companion switch.\n33#Buen producto. Bueno y a tiempo\n34#Cheap feeling, loud clicks. The electrical components seem to be fine, but the switch feels like cheap plastic and makes a loud click when clicked. Not something you‚Äôd want to use often - it just has a very bad tactile feel to it. I would not recommend this.\n35#fast delivery. good value and works well\n36#Dimmer makes a huge difference and you can adjust as you want. Huge upgrade. Like this a lot, bright lights for when you need to see (e.g. cleaning) and otherwise you can dim as you please. No humming or flicking. The only thing why I had to return some of the switches is that they require more space (more deepness) and I did not want to put in the extra work. Return of those was easy and refund came fast. Remember to order the cover extra!\n37#Tr√®s bon. Ampoules del\n38#Good product. Great product.\n39#Does the job but feels cheap for the price. Pros: -Does the job. Cons: -Razor-thin dimming slider is hard to grasp, unpleasant to the touch. -Switches sound and feel hollow when flicked. Cheap feeling. -Fins are thin. Screws heads can easily warp and go past the screw holes if you overdrive them. I had to insert washers as backing. Overall: Not enough quality for the price. Recommendation: I went with a Pass & Seymour Radiant dimmer instead. Has none of the cons above.\n40#Lurton a quality product. Very neat and easy to install.\n41#They Dim lights. 1 of the 2 came defective, wouldn't dim, but called amazon, they refunded, i ordered a new one and they both work! Lights also flicker a little bit, but it could be the bulbs.",
