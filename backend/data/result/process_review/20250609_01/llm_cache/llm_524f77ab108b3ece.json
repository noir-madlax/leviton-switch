Works as I expected: top switch acts as a light dimmer, and bottom switch is a separate non-dimming timer. Three things to note: (1) The device is deep, and generally will require a large electrical box. (2) Any LEDs on the dimmer circuit must be designed for dimming. Partially, this is so there is some \"leakage\" current through the device, even when off, to power the control logic for both switches. (3) Both switches operate from the same supply, so the dimmer and timer must be on the same circuit. (Not an unreasonable limitiation.) If I had more space to work with I would likely have used two separate devices, and probably saved some money.\n1#Very nice solution to cramped space. Very nice compact light dimmer and fan timer for a renovated bathroom. We had a single gang electrical box and could not enlarge to a two gang due to double studs next to box. This was the only solution available that I could find. Lutron makes nice gear, pricey but nice.\n2#Perfect for bathroom light and fan. Exactly what I expected for my fan and light in the bathroom Works well with nice dimmer timer features!\n3#Great solution. Perfect combo switch for a ceiling mounted bath light and fan. Fan timer and light brightness control work great.\n4#Grea. Works great, save on electric bill.\n5#A great double switch for a very specific need. I was doing a bath renovation and the bath fan was on the same switch with the light. Now, when I do a bath renovation, I try to put the fan on a timer switch and obviously that works less well if it turns out the light as well. Since there was just a single box available, this was the perfect solution. In addition, when I told my client about the switch she mentioned that she preferred less light in the bathroom, so the dimmer on the light side of the switch was perfect for her. If you have a double box available, you probably don’t need this, but for my application, this will make everyone happy.\n6#The dimmer/timer functions properly. While the dimmer/timer functions properly, I noticed that it came with no mounting screws nor any wire nuts and that the grounding wire was broken off and not in the box and that as shown in the three tabs on the right side were broken off. I don't know if it has been previously used, however, it was not NEW IN THE BOX.\n7#Only way I know to dim your light and time your fan in a one-gang box. Only way I know to dim your light and time your fan in a one-gang box, works great. My old one gave out after about 8 years and this one is the same\n8#Waited forever, this is IT! Wow, I had been watching Lutron (and other) products for years to find this set of switches, where you can turn the light on and off separate from a timed fan control for the bathroom. Couldn't believe it took that long to carry one that reviewers think is worth a salt. This one works, hooray! Follow the instruction video with the link provided and it will go a lot quicker -- it was a little confusing at first, because I thought I had more wires than the switch mechanism did, but then figured it out. I'm stoked that I can set a fan to go for a half hour or more at night when I don't need the bathroom to retain any extra moisture (old house, wet climate), and don't want to leave the fan on all night.\n9#Little expensive. But works good\n10#Dimmer won't shut off completely. Its the perfect switch, except, the dimmer lights won't shut off completely.\n11#Worked well. Does what it says , dims light and runs Panasonic fan with the timer or on button,\n12#I love it. I love this switch. Had to take out a second mortgage to afford it but I love every interaction with it.\n13#Perfect product. Solves all the issues we had. Bathroom fan timer is great so we use it daily and fan doesn’t stay on all day!\n14#LED dimmer switch and fan switch. We had the incandescent switch before. This one works the same with LEDs. So pleased. Our house was built in 1953. This does what we wanted for our bathroom. So happy they made it and it worked. Swapped out in about 10-15 minutes.\n15#Easy to install, great price. Much cheaper here than HD and works with LED",
