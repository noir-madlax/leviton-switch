These dimmers are affordable, but if it‚Äôs made for incandescent bulbs. If you dim LED more than half, it will turn off completely. If you don‚Äôt go all the way the LED will flicker\n1#Upgrade. Worked out fantastic. Excellent product,reasonable price. Very satisfied.\n2#Masculine click. Work as it should be, but on was the lower switch (though it can be flip upside down but it did not mentioned in the instructions to say if its safe to do so) and the click of the switch is masculine than it should be.\n3#Works well. Works well with recessed lights\n4#They not working. They don‚Äôt work well. When more than 4 lights are on, they start blinking. The sliders are also very bad ‚Äî they stick and are very difficult to move. I bought 50 of these, and it‚Äôs a complete waste.\n5#Junk. If you want a structure fire these are for you\n6#Look elsewhere. Unable to move the dimmer. Its jammed. I didn‚Äôt even get to use it yet, the paint inside the house isn‚Äôt even fully done, and the slider is already jammed‚Ä¶. So so so so annoying. and I can‚Äôt even return them because they are already installed. Waste of money. Look elsewhere. Unable to dim , the reason for the switch in the first place.\n7#Junk. These are supposed to work with the Amico lights and they do NOT , they flicker even when you adjusted it, junk do not buy , I missed my return window because my house was not built in time\n8#Elegantes y funcionales. Quedan hermoso, son de buena calidad y buen precio. Regulan excelente\n9#1 out of 6 Failed. One of the dimmers was malfunctioning, but all the others had already been installed, making the return process impractical. Poor quality!\n10#Buy something else. Garbage. Flickering all the time no matter what light bulb you use. I had a 6 pack installed 2. Will remove and throw all to trash. Look for something better that doesn‚Äôt flicker.\n11#Extremally low quality, I'm suspired if they are even UL certified. Poor quality fell apart during installation\n12#Defective Switch. One of the 6 switches in the box was defective. I would like to get a replacement.\n13#Arrived broken. I am unhappy with this product for one reason. I ordered the 6-pack and one of the switches came broken. Maybe it was just a single defective item. I didn‚Äôt notice this until the rest were installed, so I can‚Äôt return the full order. Hopefully the rest will work well.\n14#Don't buy. These are cheap 4 out of the six in the box we're not working stay away from this product..\n15#Great product. Great light switches dimmer woild Shop here again\n16#Changed out old yellowing switch‚Äôs. Look and work great\n17#Can't beat the price! Works and look great!\n18#Good quality and least likely to cause flickering issues in LED bulbs and panels. I‚Äôm an electrical handyman. I‚Äôve installed these dimmers multiple times without any problems. AND I use this kind and brand of dimmer for diagnosing flickering issues. üëç They tend to work best with multiple different LED brands of bulbs.\n19#Great. These were exactly what I was looking for, and at a better price than other places.\n20#How bright the lights are. These were easy to install too same. Love the different shades of brightness just all around great product\n21#Works great. I have only installed 1 and it works great. Loved the full range of dimming. I would have preferred screw clamp terinals vs. wires hanging out because that takes up more room in the box for these connections.\n22#Never again. CONSTANT FLICKERING!!!!! THROW THEM IN THE TRASH!! Not sure these are even code. They are very cheaply built and can easily break. The dimmer is also not built well. It flickers when you dim and the adjuster isn't good enough to resolve this. Also, these are so big that you are left with NO room to fit the wires. I would not buy this again. Customer service dod reach out and offered me a full refund which was greatly appreciated and they asked for feedback. I do hope they improve the product.\n23#Durable, price is cheap! I liked the product!\n24#Lights flicker when dimmed. Quality is very poor. Lights flicker when dimming. I wish i could have realized it was the dimmer much sooner. I thought my wiring may have been off. After buying a different brand and replacing it i noticed it was the dimmer. Would not buy again\n25#Like these switches. This install was easy but the taps on them can be a problem but overall works well.\n26#Cheaply made. Wouldn't reccomend. Lights flicker when dimming. I figured since they are a fraction of the cost of traditional dimmers. Would not reccomend. If you want to dimmer lights just spend the money on reputable brand dimmers. Would not reccomend\n27#DOESNT WORK. flickering and buzzing noise\n28#Bad fitmant. Could not gang 2 side by side no matter what was tried . They need to redesign product to U.S.A. standards.\n29#Works like a charm. When we buy a house, we always change out all the switches. These are my go to, and I Have always been happy I am elated that these were one I could select from. If you read a review that says that their light flickers it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre not using the appropriate lightbulbs. You need to look on the box to make sure they are dimmable or not. It‚Äôs not the fault of the switch! Do not hesitate, these are awesome and for them to include the plates is very cost-effective. They look beautiful and finished!\n30#6 Pack Slide dimmers. These are high quality single pole or 3-way compatible slide dimmer switches that are made well and come with their matching plate covers. The hardware is also included along with an instructional installation booklet. The dimmer switches remember their settings‚Ä¶once you set them then turn off the switch with the paddle toggle and go to turn it back on it returns to the setting where you last used it ingeniously retaining that last setting. Very convenient where you don‚Äôt have to constantly adjust them back to the level you prefer. They are Flicker free and offer silent dimming so there‚Äôs no humming noises with these at all. They are Compatible with most bulbs on the market including CFL, incandescent and LED types per the manufacturer‚Ä¶I‚Äôm using them with LED lights so I have no way to test the others. Excellent value in this quantity 6 pack, very nice!",
