After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Electronic Low Voltage Dimmer Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Electronic Low Voltage Dimmer Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment.

I bought two of these hoping the reviews were wrong. They hardly dim the lights. Maybe about 50% but if you are looking for a dimmer that truly gives you low light these are not it.\n1#Missing product feature. It was missing the adjustment wheel, so not useful.\n2#Dimmer does not dim, missing adjustment wheel. Tried using this for 12v puck lights on a 12v circuit. This switch dims from 12.4v to 11.8v so basically nothing. Not noticeable anyway. Garbage product.\n3#It Works But... No problems wiring and installing this dimmer for my undercabinet kitchen 12v puck lights. It works but...2 things were not as expected. First, the dimmer does NOT dim from 100%-0% (or even close). The most it will dim is about 50%. This is enough for me but be aware. Second, my dimmer did not have the adjustment wheel as shown in the product picture. Again, not a problem for me. But be aware.",
