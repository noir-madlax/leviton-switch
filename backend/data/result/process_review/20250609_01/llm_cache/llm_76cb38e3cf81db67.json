More of an off-white. Does not exactly match ELEGRP or Lutron or even other Bestten switch products. Very odd I will post a pic with ELEGRP dimmer on the left, Bestten in the middle and Lutron Maestro timer on the right. Functionality is fine so if you only have one switch and are not trying to match anything else you're golden\n1#Good product. Good quality and received quickly\n2#Useless. I didn’t like the switch. Its poor quality and switches does get stuck in the middle\n3#Recommend! Great quality\n4#Funsiona muy bien. Vusiono muy bien y es muy bien produto li recomiedo\n5#Que son de buena calidad. Muy bonitos\n6#Not white, even though box says they are! These are not white! They are an almond color, and unfortunately I’m outside the return window….\n7#Cover plate to thin. Cover plate to thin, it flex when you install, no strong enough to thigh the screw it bow in the middle\n8#Requesting replacement switch. Opened the box and found one of the switches has a black smudge stain on the cover that cannot be cleaned off. Would like a new switch sent to replace it, the other 9 look fine. Haven’t tested them yet.\n9#Good product. Good product\n10#Still going strong. I have been using this brand product for over a year now and have had no issues to date. I am still in the process of replacing switches, outlets (15, 20 and GFI) and all cover plates in the house. I highly recommend BESTTEN for these parts. For me they offer the best price break that I have found so far.\n11#Good quality and easy to use. I installed these in my older home. This small change made a wonderful upgrade to the house.\n12#Works well in all home applications. I've been replacing the old cream colored flip switches, these look good and work great!\n13#Fast. Fast shipping! Great price!\n14#Work as advertised. Swapping out existing switches for these - have not had any issues with them\n15#Switch is good, faceplate is a no go. The switch itself works good, but it's a little \"squishy\" it has a lot of give before the 'click'. Also, it took me all of 20 minutes just to install the faceplate because the holes didn't line up, so I used my drill to make the bottom hole bigger. Cheap parts at a cheap cost. You get what you pay for. The one good thing is that the color matches nicely. The switch itself is also loud, so if you need a quiet one, look elsewhere.\n16#Look good, Feel and sound cheap. I regret not spending more for better quality switches. These feel cheap and make a loud click when you switch them. Also, though the color said white, they are actually an off-white cream color. But they do work and look fine other than that.\n17#Bad quality. Half of the switches in the box were broken. Sent a message to the company and never heard a word back. Not a good bargain if half are broken.\n18#Great buyer. Save money don’t buy from big box stores, easy to install and over all good quality very happy with purchase\n19#tal como lo pedi. el producto cumplio con lo solicitado, lo recomiendo buena calidad.\n20#Not perfect, but. 2 out of the package is DOA. But manufacturer did replace the malfunction items. So, seem reasonable.\n21#2 Switches were broken in box. Everything else ok just 2 unusable switches. Quality control should better. However the ines that were usable decent\n22#Es bonito pero no es muy buena la calidad. No es buena la calidad, espero que me dure un tiempo\n23#Easy to install. Price is good and looks nice\n24#Great. Solid 3 way light switches\n25#Can the Off and On position be reversed. I like this switch, it is good as expected, my only question is that if we can reverse the on/off position. As you see in the image I have a smart switch that’s a toggle on/off switch at the bottom. However this switch has off position at the top and on position at bottom.\n26#GREAT SELLER. Item better than described, fast delivery, great seller, five stars.\n27#Value pack. Got a value pack of these for our recently purchased house.We changed all the light switches in the house.It really makes a big difference , looks modern. The install was easy . Got the entire house done in less than an hour. The price is very good for the difference it makes\n28#Works fine, good price. I'm updating my house and I installed these to replace the old \"ivory\" colored switches. These look sharp and after a couple of months of use are working just fine. Install wasn't easiest on each and every, but that was because of the wiring in the wall, not the switch.\n29#You get what you pay for! You \"LITERALLY\" pay for! These are cheap! Basic! Not really white (a shade or two off the basic white that you get at depot or lowes) They work but... Eh! I wouldn't buy again so don't bother with these.\n30#Great Product. works well.\n31#what can I say? ...its a switch! Installs easy and totally updates an older home... for the double switches I love the covers that do not show any screws they snap over a receiver on the switches ...got them here on amazon ...4 for $8\n32#Poor Durability. The rocker plastic is thin and brittle. The plastic hinge for the rocker has a high defective and breaks off. Best to avoid, I had to replace all of these light switches.\n33#Bueno. Muy buen producto y llego antes de la fecha estipulada.\n34#Nice. Got them for my mom. They look so much better than the old switches. She loves them. I am thinking of switching mine or for these.\n35#Perfect for upgrading. Perfect sleek appearance, great quality, did exactly what was needed.\n36#Great. Works great for my construction projects\n37#Small walplates. They work, but small wall plates may expose areas around switch that wouldn’t have been exposed with standard size wall plates.\n38#Colors don’t match. Switch, receptacle , and wall plates DO NOT MATCH. I sent my $250 order back.\n39#They're cheap and they work. They're cheap and they work. They don't feel high quality when you flip them on and off, and the sound from each one varies - some are louder than others. But at least they aren't the old ivory colored ones\n40#Makes your house look modern. Adding this Light Switch with Wallplate to my home was a decision I will never regret. It's not just a simple light switch but an enhancement to my room's overall aesthetics. I was particularly impressed with its sleek design. The decorator-style design seamlessly blends into the room decor, making it more than just a functional item, but also an element of design. The included wallplate was a great addition that gives the switch a clean, finished look. My Bf is an electrician and he installed them super fast. I'm changing all my light switches to this one.\n41#Great value. These are definitely only 15amp rated and definitely residential grade (not as good as commercial), but: That is what I wanted and these are decent products for 1/2 OR LESS what you would pay for a domestic model with the same specs. It's the same plastic and bent copper and spring everywhere. Totally would buy again, action is solid and they do NOT feel or appear cheap. I've had cheap domestic parts break apart on screw pressure, these held up fine going into old crowded jboxes.\n42#Good but some may be defective. Bought two packs of these, of each pack 1 was defective. The ones that work work really well.\n43#Great packagi. Product meets as advertised well constructed and easy to onstall\n44#Used for whole floor remodel! These came in perfect. Not a single one was broken and had all the screws. Very happy!\n45#Very poorly manufactured. Looks cheap\n46#Not easy to install. Easy if you have the 14gauge wire but very difficult if you use the 12 gauge wire. All of my outlet use 12 gauge so can not use the hole to push the wire in but hvae to use the side screw to hook the wires. Take a log\\\\ng time to finish replacing all the outlets. Be careful and watch out of this problem.",
