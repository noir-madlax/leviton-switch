I've had to replace 5 of them already. Causes LED light bulbs to flicker and some have burned out.\n1#No sirve al 2do día golia a quemado. No lo comprendo no tiren su dinero como yo.\n2#Dimmer Fades to Off Halfway Down. I purchased this dimmer for a set of 4 LED Dimmable track lights. Installation was simple and straighforward, but when I went to dim down, about halfway down the lights just went off. If I left the slider slightly above that cutoff point, the lights would go out in a few minutes. I have since replaced the unit with a different manufacturer, and my lights are woring fine from top-to-bottom of the dimming range. So, either it was a defective unit, or it's just poorly constructed.\n3#Bad product. Part did not work properly. Had to purchase another switch .\n4#good product. worked as described\n5#Be careful when working with switches and always turn off power at box. Easy to install\n6#Flickers. I replace a worn out Leviton 6842 (Incadescent only dimmer) that worked, until it wore out. When I installed this one, found out you need to remove metal tabs on the side to install two of these side by side. Which derates the total wattage to 500 watts. When I turned it on, my LEDs flicker until almost full brightness. I'll try some different LEDs to see if some work better.\n7#Works Well Once Wired Properly. Hopefully this helps someone if they run into the same situation. The switch I was replacing had three black wires attached to it and no ground wire. I wired this new dimmer according to the directions. The dimmer worked fine, but when I turned it on it shut down all of the other lights and outlets that were on that same circuit. And even when the dimmer was off, the other lights on that circuit were not at full brightness. After a lot of research and attempts to fix the issue, it turned out that I had to combine the existing hot wire and one of the other existing black traveler wires with the black wire of the new dimmer to make the whole thing work. That allowed the dimmer to work by not cutting off the rest of the circuit, and for the power to not have to travel through the dimmer when the dimmer was off. Outside of that, the switch works fine, although the slide switch seems a bit touchy when adjusting it.\n8#Switch with dimmer & works with LED Light. Everything was included in the package for this LED Switch with dimmer. We installed it easily on a 2-way switch. The other switch is a regular one.\n9#Nice dimmer. This switch was as described. Well made, easy to install( if you're comfortable with replacing electricals). Directions are clear and easy to install. The on/off and sliding dimmer controls are nice.\n10#This product has a shiny finish. The light dims quickly and is off half the way down\n11#LED or Incadesant lighting. DIYers Know the Lighting LED Wattage use and or the Incandescent Wattage use. NOTE that LED WATTAGE is ONLY 150 Watts max. Don't forget basic wiring before you install. Turn off the circuit breaker. Instructions are very helpful especially if you read. When all else fails, read the instructions again and visit their website as they have a very helpful YouTube Video to assist with installation.\n12#Excellent. Nice dimmer switch.\n13#Dimmer works. Overall good quality and works well but installation instruction to setup brightness control is not well described. Need easy way to adjust low and high control mechanism.\n14#Flickers - Not for LED. Unable to be returned. Flickers - Not for LED. Unable to be returned.\n15#For the price, it does what it needs to. I got this to replace a toggle dimmer that didn't have a lot of throw, so it was hard to get the right brightness, it also tended to flicker when below 50%. This one does a nicer job and the dial that allows you to set the minimum is a nice feature. Now, it will only go as low as I set the dial vs trying to find the dimmest setting possible each time I want to turn it down. However, it does seem to make some of our dimmable LED bulbs hum when below 50% or so. I don't know if that's due to the bulbs or the switch, but I don't recall the old switch doing that. It's a very quiet hum that you have to almost stick your ear to the bulb to hear, but it is audible a bit further away when our HVAC fan shuts off.\n16#Good switch. Easy to install and easy to adjust the led setting. Works great.\n17#Well-constructed, very good hardware. I've installed a few switches and this one by far has the best hardware I've used. The mounting and finishing screws are very high-quality. The switch itself feels very sturdy and well-made. It installed easily and works flawlessly.\n18#trim plate may be a touch narrow. the trim plate could be wider, our home was built in the 1920s ergo the outlet opening istrim plate thru plaster & lathe and touch wider than in drywall.\n19#Great price. These dimmers r great to have easy to install and use\n20#Easy installation! Wires are labeled for fail-proof installation.\n21#Great light fixture. Great lighting fixture. I like the on/off switch at the bottom so I won't wear out the slider buttons trying to turn on/turn off the lights. Easy to install and no need to secure the wires to screws.\n22#Worked great. Used it on my girls vanity light up mirror after it stoped turning on. Works great, you’d never know there was anything wrong with it.\n23#Works as promised. Color is a little off light almond shade I wanted. Overall good value. Works with the ceiling light. Color is a little off\n24#Works as expected. Works great\n25#Great Item and Price. I had never installed a dimmer switch before, but this was fairly easy. It’s a simple task and the end result is great. The price was absolutely perfect also because these go for double and triple the price in Home Depot.\n26#eliminate flickering LEDs. This was easy to install. Replaced a older 3 way dimmer which didn't work with Leds. This one works great, excellent dimming range with no flickering.\n27#Barely dims, get a PWM model instead. This switch barely changes the brightness of the bulb. I tried it with both dimmable LED and incandescent. It worked marginally better with the incandescent. It looks nice, but does not work adequately. Install was ok, but directions could have been made much clearer.\n28#Work as intended! Work as intended it was easy to replace old one and straightforward.\n29#Bad news. Doesn't work what so ever terrible purchase.\n30#Great, Simple Dimmer. This was easy to install. It was just what I needed for a new chandelier that we put in our dinning room. It was too bright and we wanted to be able to dim the lights for dinner. I installed it with my 9 year old son to teach him the basics of electricity.\n31#Great product. Works great\n32#Works well. Works well.\n33#Work Great with LEDs. PARMIDA (12 Pack) 5/6” Dimmable LED Disk Light Flush Mount work perfectly. I have 4 on one dimmer and one on another.\n34#Multi pole Rheostat at a good price. Works with 2 pole or 3 pole, simple instructions, 15 minute job. Just remember to turn off the correct circuit breaker.\n35#Works great. Easy to replace, this switch works great.\n36#One out of 12 is defective. 11 worked great all were easy to in stall the last one would not operate. I think you owe me a full refund or at least a replacement\n37#Easy to install. Came with good instructions for a guy that doesn't do well with electricity, it works great!\n38#Best dimmer whit good price. I’m electrician & installed this type of dimmer Many of them . I didn’t have any my clients to call me back for this dimmer Actually this only dimmer you can adjust brightness on low position & it is very helpful specially for led dimmable bulbs . because you should not dim to led to the very low position that is why your Led lights it would flickering. Because not enough voltage reach to the led I think most people they don’t know how to setup this dimmer Here the tip 1-Turn lights on 2- Bring slider all the way to the bottom Then turn rotate adjustable on the side until lights come on keep to low dim you like 3-. Make sure select dimmer not on the very low brightness . (Idea to dim the All Led only %75) Remember led is not old fashion incandescent bulbs you were able to dim all way to % 99\n39#Dos the job. Does the job. Has adjustment for various types of lamps, LED, incandescent, CFL. Easy to install as any switch.\n40#Flicker on some led. Easy to install and adjust. Did have some flicker issues with a frittata led lamp.\n41#Great! Worked absolutely great with my LED recessed lights\n42#Easy intsalation in. Exactly what I ordered. Works perfectly. Love it.\n43#Easy to install. These don't turn on when set to low light position. Need to turn up then down. Maybe just a led light affect\n44#Good valu. Work as stated\n45#Great product for a great price. Easily replaced my old 3 way pole dimmer with this Maxxima 3-Way/Single Pole Dimmer. less than 5 minutes to replace and works great. Highly Recommended!\n46#Terrible for LED light bulbs dimming, as if only two settings: dim and full on... This Maxxima 3-Way/Single Pole Dimmer Electrical Light Switch has the worst dimming range of any LED dimmer anywhere. Think of it has really having only two settings : dim and full on. If you try to balance the slider in the middle, you get flickering badly. I thought it might be the LED bulbs, then swapped out to some expensive Edison style dimmables that are smooth using a Levitron dimmer, and it's like night and day. I really was hoping to get a LED dimmer under $15 for a bathroom that is mostly unused, but this would be embarrassing to have somebody try to use this low quality \"Dimmer\". Back to Amazon it goes!",
