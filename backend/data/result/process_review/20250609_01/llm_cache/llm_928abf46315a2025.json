Used this to go between bookcase and wall for controlling fireplace blower; not enough room for hands\n1#Excellent dimmer with timer ⏲️. Works perfectly, schedule timer works great with the gosund app. Dimmer works great as well\n2#Great dimmer. Very easy to install\n3#Great Ghome dimmer switch. This dimmer switch has been great. Our old switch made our LED lights flicker, but they have stopped that. The lights also seem brighter. Love that I can have Alexa handle the work when I don’t want to get up, too. All of the Ghome switches we have are great! Not sure why our dimmer switch hadn’t been switched to a Ghome until now.\n4#Great dimmer switch. Love this brand works awesome.\n5#Great Smart Switch. INSTALL: Instructions were lacking if you don't have prior experience installing light switches. The wire nuts that are provided worked on three of the connections, but my husband had to find a larger nut for the fourth connection. PAIRING WITH ALEXA: Pairing was pretty efficient once the Gosund App was installed on my iPhone. You can control the switch via the Gosund app, Amazon Alexa app, or voice control with Alexa. Using these controls, you can turn the light on/off or dim. You can also create a routine which turns the lights on/off according to a set time. MANUAL CONTROL: This switch is very responsive to the touch of a finger, easily turning on, off, or dimming. BOTTOM LINE: This switch works great and I'm quite pleased with it. I love that it can be controlled via an app in addition to my Echo. 5 Stars.\n6#Smart wall switch. Work and super easy to install and program.\n7#A great Smart switch! This smart switch has a similar chassis design to a name-brand manufacturer but this one is half the price of it, truth be old I have had less issues with this unit than the name-brand one. This switch installed without issue, has worked flawlessly for months now! The app and Alexa control was super easy. Zero complaints and I absolutely love that the Status LEDs are always displayed. Very easy to recommend this switch\n8#5/5 great dimmer. Works as hoped, installation was a breeze. Has a touch screen interface that initially was not expected but we have come to like the feature for dimming.\n9#Watch your wiring! Good (when you don't blow it up 😂) No issues with it other than when I accidentally shorted the device when getting into the junction box for something else and accidentally overloaded the thing to which it was no longer.\n10#Great switch and brand. I just love these switches. They do the job every time. Never a problem installing or connecting to the Wi-Fi. It’s only when I forget my password to the Wi-Fi that I have issues 😂\n11#Dimmer switch for couch potatoes. Easy to set up with Alexa and the app. Build quality is good and I like the simple design With the connection to Alexa I can stay sat on the sofa and ask Alexa to dim the lights - much more reliable than getting the kids to get up and do it. Being able to schedule or control lights remotely is great for when your not home will be getting more...\n12#Worked Fine As A Wall Dimmer, But... I've had this dimmer for a few months. As a wall mounted dimmer it worked OK. We have both Alexa and Google in our home. I've tried several times to get it to work with each without success. Maybe I just got a bad sample. I wouldn't try this again. It was too frustrating.\n13#Perfect switch. I love these dimmer switches so much. I have many throughout the house and have never had an issue installing them. The button is very \"clicky\" which I like. One of my favorite features is that it shows what the brightness level is on the switch even if the light is off. I have also had no issues connecting to the smart life app, controlling with Alexa, and integrating into home asisstant\n14#Dimming switch. Dimmer switch not dimming down or up. This does work as it should.\n15#Love it. Love the fact that I can control it from my phone. Wish the lowest setting was dimmer than it is. But overall I love it.\n16#Great dimmer! Well documented- easy install\n17#Replaces normal switches and it better in almost every way! These smart switches are so intuitive and clever! They provide all the functionality of a normal switch but with the smart features you love. Want to turn off your light automatically? No problem with this product. It is super easy to set up and can be used anywhere. It is easy to connect and use just like a normal light switch. It dims very well and is very quick and responsive.\n18#Smartphone-controllable light switch/dimmer. In service at our northern Michigan cottage to allow an outside lighting circuit to be controlled via Alexa on a phone. Works well. Installation requires basic electrician skills, or having it done by a pro.\n19#Ghome wireless switch. Love the dimmable capability!!! Wish they made it in 2pong as well!!!\n20#Came with everything I needed to install. App worked with Alexa in minutes! This switch comes with everything you need to install: Switch plate, screws, and wire nuts. The switch has stranded wire leads to make connections. The wire nuts supplied allow the leads to be connected your house wiring. If you want to wire the solid copper house wiring to the switch then this is not possible. You may want to make sure you have a junction box with enough space to accommodate the additional wire and wire nuts. The cover plate supplied is a snap-on cover, no screws needed if you have dual switches that are a rocker style you will not need to purchase an additional cover plate. The switch is made for a screw on plate if you choose to use your old switch plate. I downloaded the app and installed it with Alexa voice control in about three to five minutes, very simple.\n21#works great, looks great, good value. Great value, this switch was easy to install, came with labels to help with installation, good instructions and wiring diagrams, and works great out of the box. the dimmer is intuitive to use, and the remote control app is responsive and simple. google home integration was simple and painless, and mitigates the pain of having multiple different brands of smart devices (if you're like me). Looks good, works great, and great value. I'd recommend!\n22#Easy install. This switch was very easy to install. You just have to make sure that your current wiring will work, you need a constant power line in order to work. You also have to make sure your wifi has 2.4 ghz and not just 5ghz or you wont be able to hook to the internet. Other then that the directions are clear and easy to follow.\n23#Really nice smart switch. I love the illuminated power button. It is a thoughtful touch that eliminates midnight wall-fumbling, and the sleek touch controls add a modern feel to my wall plate. Integration with Google Home was surprisingly straightforward. I had it up and running in minutes, and now I can adjust brightness levels with just a voice command. The touch-sensitive dimming strip responds smoothly without any lag, though it did take a day or two to get used to. Highly recommend this dimmer!\n24#Easy install and works great with our Alexa. The switch feels well made and the buttons are very crisp. The switch isn't as deep as a few others I've tried to install, so there is room behind it to stuff all the wires in the service box. It's a 4 wire install and everything is labelled well as to which wire is which. Bluetooth was aan easy pairing, but you have to go through the Gosund app first, then share it to your Alexa. Once you have Alexa paired, you are good to go. Voice activation for on/off and dimmer is very easy, there is even an event timer si you can pre-set on in the morning, off after you leave for work, then setup the same for when you get home and for bedtime. The timer doesn't need voice to activate, it does its thing based on your system time. Very cool feature. I think the price for this one is very fair and so far I haven't had any issue with the switch!\n25#Overall Good smart dimmer switch with minor flaws (with app setup ). I wanted to replace my existing dimmer switch which was flickering my LED lights. This Ghome smart dimmer was easy to replace and works well on wall. Installation Requires a neutral wire (I had to plug in neutral and ground directly inline -unlike in manual) and a 2.4GHz ONLY Wi-Fi connection for app control. No hub needed. Dimming Control is not as described like 1% to 100%. It is an incremental of some 15%. A touch-sensitive interface switch is great. No flickers in low light. It was hard to set it with it's own app \"GOsund\" and it only accepts 2.4Ghz wifi. Then it was easy with Alexa app. Though I was not able to set with Google Home or asisstant It has added feature of Schedule and Timer which is great, I hve not used so far. Remote & Group Control features lighting status and manage multiple dimmer switches remotely via the app.\n26#Works with SmartLife/Tuya app. Comes with faceplate and installation hardware. This is a nice dimmer. I already have the previous model installed in another room. This one has several big improvements. Capacitive strip doesn’t have false readings when you press the switch to turn on the light and accidentally touch the lower end of the strip. Firmware prevents it from erroneous dimming. To dim after you turn it on you really have to lift your finger and then touch the capacitive strip. SmartLife interface was also improved. It now allows locking the minimum brightness at 100% so you could turn this dimmer into a discrete switch if you plan to use it with non-dimmable lighting. Added countdown function allows to run timers on the new switch hardware, so timer automations will work without stable internet connection. Also you can now set the recovery state to on, off or last known before power or Internet connection failure. Machine screws, wire connectors and snap-on faceplate were included.\n27#Convenient and Responsive Smart Dimmer Switch. The Ghome Smart Dimmer Switch has been a fantastic addition to my home setup. Pros: Easy to install with clear instructions. Setting it up with my 2.4GHz Wi-Fi was straightforward. Works seamlessly with Alexa and Google Home, making voice control a breeze. The dimmer function is very smooth and responsive, allowing precise adjustments to light levels. The design is sleek and modern, blending well with any decor.\n28#Stylish dimmer. All round a pretty good smart dimmer: Capacitance touch brightness setting Easy installation (requires both neutral and ground wire) Stores last setting when turning on. Click on and off. Can be app controlled. Very good price given feature set - $19.99 at the time of this review.\n29#Easy installation and works great. I have 18 GHome/Gosund products now. This is my first smart switch. Installation was simple and straight forward. Adding to the Smart Life app was simple as well. As will all my Ghome smart devices this single pole dimmer functions flawlessly.\n30#Works With SmartLife App. This dimmer switch was easy to install, taking about 10 minutes from start to finish. It quickly paired to the SmartLife app and works as expected. Like other smart switches, it has a push on/off functionality and a capacitive tactile dimmer that works by sliding your finger up and down the switch. When paired with LED lights, there was some LED flicker at various dimmer levels that I did not encounter with my previously smart dimmer (that failed after 4 years of use). I was able to sort out that issue with the app but it took a little time to mess with the configurations. This is a nice-looking switch and hopefully lasts longer than my last one.\n31#Stylish smart dimmer switch. My main criteria for a smart switch is ease of install and ease of pairing to Alexa. Install: - The product has decent instructions, is well packaged, and wires clearly marked. Be aware that the electronics in a smart switch always need to be active so this switch does require a neutral. - includes decent wire nuts (the switch has pigtails not terminals) - did not include screws to mount the switch. It DID include the typical short screws for attaching a switch plate but the plate for this switch is a clip on style, not screw on. So this was a QC fail on the manufacturer’s end. Fortunately I had an inventory of the longer screws needed for mounting. Pairing to Alexa: The instructions are less than helpful in my opinion. They explain how to pair with their own app or with their “gosund” skill. Going with either of course requires you to set up an account (yet another smart app account - ugh). Fortunately (and unstated) the device will pair with the Tuya app, which most people have. In this respect it pairs up to Tuya-> Alexa as most devices like this do. Dinging this 1 star for not explaining the method to pair with Tuya. Otherwise, device works as advertised.\n32#High Quality SMART Dimmer Switch. It looks like a quality product, comes with clear easy to follow instructions, and should be very easy to install provided you have a neutral wire available. I love that it can be installed and functions just like a normal dimmer switch, or it can be fully controlled by Alexa using simple voice commands to fully automate an unlimited number of customized scenes and scenarios. I have now installed several smart, undercabinet, LED lighting fixtures, and I plan to use this dimmer to control and automate all of them. I will create a group called countertop lighting and will be able to control all of the lights with this dimmer or just with my voice. Nothing could be easier! And at the end of the day, when I turn in one simple voice command turns on my night lights and turns everything else in the house off except for my bedtime music which plays for about 45 minutes softly before turning off along with any remaining night lights. With this cool technology, I can now control all of the lights in my house, my thermostat, my fireplace, and music in any and all rooms. And I can do all of this using very simple voice commands from any room in my house, or even from my iPhone while I’m away. This is very cool technology that brings great convenience and provides an enormous amount of functionality limited, perhaps only by your imagination and comfort in dealing with fairly simple technology. I can hardly wait to install this new switch Which will allow me to fully control my counter top lighting while I’m working in the kitchen, using only my voice.\n33#Worked for a little while. Worked for a few days and then the switch became unresponsive. Strangely enough the app still works great but physically pushing the switch does nothing.\n34#Convenient and Reliable Smart Dimmer. The Ghome Smart Dimmer Switch has made my life so much easier! My original light switch is located far away from the actual light, which used to mean a lot of back-and-forth trips just to adjust the lighting or turn on/off. With this dimmer switch, that hassle is completely gone. I connected it to Alexa in minutes, and now I can simply control my lights with my voice. it’s such a time-saver! The dimming feature works smoothly, and the Wi-Fi connection has been reliable so far. My only suggestion for improvement would be adding a customizable backlight on the switch for easier visibility at night. Overall, this smart dimmer is a fantastic upgrade for anyone looking to simplify their home lighting.\n35#Standard installation & easy-enough pairing. As with any electrical project - make sure that you know what you're doing. Safety first - turn off electrical/circuit going to the swich & consult an electrician if you're unfamiliar/uncomfortable with the process. That said - installation of the switch was fairly straightforward & easy. It is in-line with the installation of any standard electrical switch. The switch does have leads that hang off of it, rather than attaching the electrical wires directly 'in' to the switch, but it isn't a huge deal. If your electrical box is tight, this could add a little bulk to the box. Make sure that your wire nuts are on tight, as it is easy for the switch leads to slip off of the wire/out of the nut if not done properly. Pairing to the device was also 'as expected.' I use SmartThings, so as has been the case with many other smart devices that I have in my home, I was able to get the switch paired, so that it could be 'imported' into SmartThings - which allows the different devices to talk to each other & react/trigger one another. To me, this is a key component of a smart home. Overall, I'm happy with this switch & happy to recommend it to others.\n36#Nice upgrade. I had a non smart dimmer that wouldn't dim as much as we wanted. I replaced it with this and it is a much better dimmer than I had. It was easy to install. You will need a common (normally white) wire. Remember to turn off the power before you or anyone else starts the installation. The box does get a little crowded but with a little work you can get them all in. Set up for Alexa was pretty simple. You do need to download their Ghome app. There are instructions included. At the bottom of the switch is where you manually turn the light of and on. The center has a long indentation with several leds. This is where you manually dim the light. The leds track with the brightness of the light when you run you finger up and down the switch. A single led stays lit when you turn off the light showing you where it was when turned off. Works well for me. Hopefully, it will for you as well.\n37#Easy to install, nice looking, works with Smartlife app. My second one of these Ghome smart switches and it works great. Pretty straight forward to install and connects easily to the Smartlife app, which I use for other decides also so it's one less app to have to install. One feature I really like is that the faceplate snaps on to the switch, so no screw needed. This looks cleaner and avoids the issue with existing holes not lining up.\n38#Ghome Smart Dimmer Switch Single Pole 2.4GHz Wi-Fi Smart Switch Dimmer. This smart switch dimmer installs easily with included wire nuts. I couldn't get the dimmer function to work at the switch, only on the app, but it does work so not sure what I was doing wrong. Would prefer if this had holes with screws to tighten connections for ground, line, and load with just a single wire for neutral, but this has wires for all 4 so you need to wire nut the connections.\n39#Be sure to download their app. This review is for the Ghome Smart Dimmer Switch Single Pole 2.4GHz Wi-Fi Smart Switch Dimmer. It's a nice looking dimmer switch which requires a neutral. The first thing you need to do is download their app using the QR code on the box. Once you do that run the app and set up an account over bluetooth. After that for Google Home allow their app to connect to the device (power light should be blinking) and log it into your wifi network. Then link the two accounts. Once done it can be used within Google Home. Works great looks good, instructions could be better.\n40#Great smart dimmer switch. My review of the Ghome Smart Dimmer Switch Single Pole 2.4GHz Wi-Fi Smart Switch Dimmer Smart Light Switch Dimmer WiFi Switch Smart Dimmer Light Switch Compatible with Alexa and Google Home, White 1 Pack This is a very nice dimmer switch. It is easy to operate and looks good on the wall. Remember as with any electrical device if you don't know what you're doing please call an electrician. This switch was easy to install and they even give you labels for the wiring to keep the confusion level down. Once it was installed my Echo device found it quickly and connection was simple. I have voice control of the switch with my Echo and I can also control it with the app. I like this dimmer and would recommend it to anyone. Just remember this is for lighting only and should not be used to control a ceiling fan or any type of motor. And yes I did change the name of my Echo device to Ziggy.",
