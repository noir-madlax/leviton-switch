My husband installed these for me all over the house. We had an electrician install a 3 way one and he had issues with it. But eventually he got it up and working\n1#Great value and idea but issues with flicker. Love these but they struggle with our LED lights which are rated dimmable. Even after doing the adjustment. I did replace all light switches in my house with these with the same in ceiling LED candle lights. For the price, they are great and above the functionality, but again having issues with flicker.\n2#quick ship great pricing. needed for changing out many switches to LED the bulk pack is the best pricing each\n3#they work. dimmers for LED lights are always hit or miss but for my application they work , i do occasionally get some flikering but a minor adjust fixes it. overall i think they are a good value.\n4#Luz. Excelente producto y llego en óptimas condiciones. Hace su función muy bien. Lo recomiendo.\n5#On delay and flickering, cheap construction. When turning on the switch, there is sometimes a second delay, causing confusion. There is a dim then bright when turning on too. Sometimes the lights flicker when adjusting the brightness. These feel cheap and will not use the rest of the package for replacing dimmer switches.\n6#Mediocre Switches With No Adjustment. Switches work fine and are fairly easy to install. They lack slotted mounting adjustments like other name brand switches so double gang boxes require you to loosen the other switch if the faceplate won't fit, which it never does with these switches. See pictures of both kinds of switches, one with adjustable mounting and the other (these switches) without the ability to move them at all.\n7#Quality is excellent and an excellent price! Hi quality product, excellent price. Easy installation for both single pole and 3 way switches.\n8#Work nice. Work great with the new can built in lights in ceilings.\n9#Sub standard quality. The dimmer does not always turn on when switched. You have to adjust dimmer to turn on. Also dimmer installed upside down. High at bottom low at top.",
