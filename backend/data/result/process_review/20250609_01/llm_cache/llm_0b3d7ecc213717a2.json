Switch is nice and modern. Easy installation. Dimmer has a nice low light and a very good bright light\n1#Previous Dimmer Dimmed By Itself. The previous dimmer I had installed worked fine for about a year. Suddenly it started to dim down by itself. It is installed in a bathroom with 8 bulbs and apparently drew too much wattage for the dimmer to handle. This one is rated for 600 watts and so far so good.\n2#very good quality. I loved it because I can adjust the light in the room, it looks very good quality and it is very easy to install\n3#Well Made & Looks Nice. This product is well made. The switch is not flimsy like other units I looked at. I love the way it looks & is easy to use. The instructions for installation are also pretty easy to follow, which is really nice. It includes everything needed for installation.\n4#Excellent. Switch,build Quality, perfect and good material\n5#Easy Install & Works Great! I love that it works in both 3-way and single pole setups, and the best part — no neutral wire required. Installation was straightforward, even for someone with basic DIY skills. The dimming slider is smooth and responsive, giving me full control over the lighting in my bedroom.\n6#As Advertised. As Advertised\n7#Not worth a penny. No matter how I wired this dimmer switch, it never dimmed. Only on and off. Nothing else. I wired it a dozen different times in every possible way. What's even worse, both load wires are the exact same color. Solid red. Neither one of them is white striped or properly marked to reflect which is the trailing wire. Waste of money and LOTS of time. Lowes, here I come.\n8#Easy to Install & Works Great. I installed this in my hallway where I had older switches, and it worked perfectly—no neutral wire needed, which saved me time and hassle. The dimming function is smooth, and it works great with my LED bulbs. It feels sturdy, and the slide is very responsive. Will definitely buy more for other rooms.\n9#Smooth Dimming, Easy Installation – Great Upgrade for Any Room. I recently installed this dimmer light switch in both my bedroom and hallway, and it has exceeded expectations. It works flawlessly in both 3-way and single pole setups, offering a lot of flexibility for different room layouts. The dimming slider is smooth and responsive, allowing for precise control over brightness levels. It supports a range of bulb types—LEDs, CFLs, incandescent, and halogen—which is a huge plus. I especially appreciate that it doesn't require a neutral wire, which made installation in my older home super straightforward. The overall build feels sturdy and the design is clean and modern. For the price, this is a great value and a simple way to enhance lighting ambiance throughout the house.\n10#Smooth Dimming and Easy to Install. This dimmer switch works perfectly! The lighting adjusts smoothly, and installation was quick and simple. It looks sleek and works great with LED bulbs. Highly recommend!\n11#Fantastic choice. This switch worked perfectly without needing to rewire anything, which saved me time and money.\n12#Safe and easy install - works as expected. 10 min install. Easy to install even for a novice like me. Works great !\n13#Excellent switches. We have been working on a renovation and buying a lot of Moes electrical switches. This will replace our fan double gang box. Love the Moes products. We only have positive experiences. My favorite feature? They hide the screws!\n14#Have someone who is familiar with wiring install, don't really need a professional. Wiring diagram a little confusing for a topical DIY.\n15#Love the dimmer with on/off switch. Installed in 2 areas with led lamps. One had 6 50w bulbs, other had 8 40w. No flickering. Smooth operation. Threw away the inclosed cover. Wouldn't stay on. Glad I purchased the additional cover that is secured with screws.\n16#Good switch! I didn’t know I purchased a three way switch, but after reading the instructions and figure it out, it was very easy to wire. Works great.\n17#Very Nice. Great dimmer/switch. Works with my LED light. Easy to wire up. Looks great, nice clean install.\n18#Return. This item did not work on my outlet\n19#Funcional y Versátil !! Cumple con su funcionamiento sin necesidad de cable Neutro (N) y con opción para utilizar hilo para conmutador de 3-vías convencional. además de estético, óptimo en profundidad de espacio dentro de la caja de muro y cuenta con trimmer que permite ajustar el nivel mínimo cuando el Slider está abajo para que las luces LED no parpadeen.\n20#Adjust when using LEDs. Works as described. I like the litle switch underneath the cover to adjust the flickering when using LEDs. Great\n21#Awesome value. Worked great\n22#love the dimmer for romance. This switch is great to add to the dimmer to a room for romance. the white color is nice and modern.\n23#Easy to Install, No Flickering. Easy to install, and it works nicely. We have not had any problems with it, and no flickering.\n24#Luce bien. Cumplió tal cual la función para lo que lo compre. Muy satisfecho del producto y es bonito.\n25#Works well. This dimmer switch is with every penny. I installed it at our master bedroom and I am so happy that is don't have to buy another lights. I can just use the dimmer to dim the lights. It has good brightness and dimming features is smooth. Easy to install and looks high end.\n26#Used switch in box. Wire was melted and looks to have been installed\n27#Great dimmer switches. Really like these switches, after 2 months still impressed with them. Would buy again.\n28#It works. Works perfectly and was very easy to connect ourselves. I only wish it dimmed the lights more than it does, but it works well for our home office.\n29#Works extremely well for a reasonable price. All in all the performance of this product is great. The only reason I’m taking away one star is because the cover plate was a little tricky to snap on. It could be better designed. You may have to mess around with it a little bit but once you get it on, it’s a great product. The best thing about it is my wife loves it, and I’m now a hero for installing it! Something that simple – who knew?\n30#It Works. Easy Install.... Work's Great\n31#Doesn't dim the lights by much. Although easy to install, i was really disappointed in how little it dims the lights. I can barely tell the difference between being at the highest and lowest setting.\n32#Fits existing box easily. Excellently\n33#i liked. it's cool,modern to use and easy to install\n34#This works okay. This works okay. The slider is a little stiff when moving, but that's acceptable. Instructions for the snap-on face plate feature were nonexistent, and figuring out how to make that work took longer than it should have. But overall, it is working okay and looks good.\n35#Fantastic Dimmer Switch. The dimming function is smooth and precise, allowing me to create the perfect ambiance in any room. Installation was straightforward, thanks to clear instructions, and the modern design adds a sleek touch to my decor. Reliable, easy to use, and highly functional—this switch exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to enhance their lighting setup!\n36#Easy to install and works great. With its precise lighting control and ease of installation, it creates the ideal atmosphere for any occasion. Both of my LED applications are fully dimmable, adjustable, and flicker-free.\n37#Dimmer switch. I really like the slide bar for the dim feature. I can move it with ease.\n38#Light Switch. 1. Ease of Installation: This switch is a game-changer as it doesn’t require a neutral wire, making it ideal for older homes or setups without a neutral connection. The installation process was straightforward with the included instructions. 2. 3-Way & Single Pole Compatibility: The flexibility of using this as either a 3-way or single pole switch is a great feature, especially for areas like hallways or bedrooms where multi-way control might be needed. 3. Wide Compatibility: It works perfectly with various bulb types, including LED, CFL, incandescent, and halogen, handling up to 600W. This versatility ensures compatibility with almost any lighting setup. 4. Dimming Functionality: The sliding dimmer provides smooth control over brightness, allowing you to create the perfect ambiance for any occasion. The switch feels sturdy, and the slider operates smoothly without flickering or glitches.\n39#Nice switch. Easy to hookup, no flickering or issues. Worked great. Iime the design of the dimmer, for me it's much better than the tiny thin tabs that move up and down that are hard to get a hold of. Really like this.\n40#Switch works great. Simply easy to install and works great\n41#Good quality and easy install. Fully adjustable and appear more durable than the toggle switch type that can break if you push them in the center by accident . Full dimming, adjustable and no flicker on both of my LED applications.\n42#Nice Big Buttons Are Easy to Use. I was looking for a dimmer that didn't require a neutral wire, and this one worked perfectly. The installation was incredibly easy, just a few screws and the big buttons give it a sleek, modern look. It works seamlessly with our LEDs.\n43#Works fine. Installed new accent lights. This switch was perfect for them.\n44#Easy install, analog is the best. Used to dim and control 4 recessed led lights and worked flawlessly , installed in minutes. It looks really cool and great value for money.\n45#Smart Switch. It's easy to install and provides precise control over your lighting, creating the perfect ambiance for any occasion.\n46#PERFECT DIMMER! I like this dimmer switch A LOT! We installed \"can lighting\" in the living room, these are led lights and they're SUPER BRIGHT! There's already a dimmer in the dining room and it does need replacing so after the ease of installation of this one, we're going to replace that one with this switch soon too!\n47#Easy setup and easy use. This product is really good love how you can dim and brighten the lights.\n48#Smooth dimming. I had no problems with this switch, and it works just as it should. Perfectly smooth dimming for the LED.",
