Wall plates are extremely difficult to snap in place. So far I have installed 8 different switches and only one wall plate will attach. You have to mess around with adding washers and adjusting the electrical box to make the plate attach. Not worth spending an extra 15- 20 extra on each outlet/switch. Don’t waste your money and just get the screw on plates. I am now having to order a bunch of screw in wall plates now which is frustrating.\n1#Great value and sleek look. These covers look clean and modern. Easy to install and great quality plastic. Gave my home a refreshed look. Would buy again.\n2#Only last a couple years. I put these switches in my entire home 3 years ago, I have had to replace a couple already because they were completely broken, 90 percent of every switch I have is cracked shown in the picture. These probably aren't good for anyone that doesn't know how to swap out the switches every couple years. Wouldn't recommend.\n3#Easy to Install. Just recently moved into a newer house. All the switches and recepticals were that creamy almond color. Spruced things up a bit by instaling these BESTTEN wall outlets as well as the paddle switches for the lights. NUMBE ONE-> BE SURE TO TURN OFF YOUR BREAKER TO THE SWITCH/OUTLET YOU WILL BE WORKING ON! Safety is not second here. Most of the wiring in the house was 14 AWG so the wires just slid into the back! Others were the 12 AWG and needed to be screwed to the side mount screws. Also since the attaching screws are under the faceplate, the look is so clean. Makes the house look super modern now!\n4#Great product. What a fantastic product! Very easy installation, nice and stylish. Love it! Awesome product!\n5#Good for the price! They’re not perfect. We’ve had two switches that stopped working on us. Our most used light switch in the house is really hard to turn off after 6 months of use. But it’s still functional! And for the price, we’re happy. We’ll be purchasing them for the rest of the house.\n6#As advertised. Durability is key and time will determine that. Have not had them long enough to critique\n7#Beautiful switches. These are great. Value for money. Beautiful to look at. A little finicky to install but the real downfall of these (and not just this manufacture ) is that THE SCREWS THEY SUPPLY ARE ALWAYS 1/4\" TOO SHORT. HELLO!! Is anyone from QC reading the comments? I'm seeing a lot of people complaining about the length of the screws. They are just too short for North American homes. We don't live in paper houses lol so need longer screws. If they changed the screws to 1\" it would be perfect.\n8#Paquete incompleto. Faltan apagadores\n9#No es silencioso, 2/10 estaban dañados. No es silencioso, 2/10 estaban dañados\n10#Good deal. Nice product as described I had one switch that wouldn’t stay engaged an one cover with out screws. Please advise the size of the screws to attach the switch plate due to the fact I lost a screw or two. Thank you in advance.\n11#very loud. These LOOK great, but they SOUND cheap. They are LOUD. Theres no way I could live with the loud clicking sound every time you turned them on and off. Only $50 more for the entire house to install the better brand from home depot... you get what you pay for.\n12#Wall Plate Thick and Odd Fit. The wall plate is think and extends beyond the switch - see photo. They attempted to hide screws, but as a result it made the plate to thick. Additionally there were some quality issues with the switch wire push-in not holding and slipping right back out. Had to use screw downs to make sure good contact was made and wires were not loose.\n13#Sandwich style and loud. The other BESTTEN products tricked me into thinking these were the seamless design - they’re not. I should have noticed there were no side pictures. Still better looking than a plate with screws though. They’re also the loudest light switch you’ll ever hear. For the price they’re not worth returning - just won’t be putting them in a bedroom.\n14#Not QUIET operation as per product description. They CLICK. These are NOT quiet operation as listed in the description. This is the verbiage from the product details: A positive, yet smooth and quiet On/Off paddle action\n15#Good product. Good product\n16#Great look. I love the look of these as opposed to the old style toggle switches.\n17#All the reviews are accurate. They were easy to install. They stick out a bit from wall and quite loud when using them but the price is good! And after awhile you get accustomed to it\n18#Slick Wall Light Switches. These Wall Light Switches are great. Looks good after installation.\n19#Screwless plate not the expected design. So I ordered these switches, because all the big brands carried at HomeDepot & co now have their branding on the switches. I'm pretty happy so far, except for the wall plates. The are a \"sandwich\" design, which don't match for example the BESTTEN USWP4 2gang face plates, or other smart switches like Kasa and c by ge. Now I have to order the face plates that are the correct design...\n20#Broke after limited use. A rocker dimmer switch in a little used second bathroom broke within 6 months of living in the house.\n21#Functions as intended. Great for what I needed. Easy installation. Not too deep or wide. Look great on the wall.\n22#They are ok. They are pretty thin and they don’t align correctly and the leave a slight gap. I would recommend getting something else. Though these aren’t the worst if you’re wanting to save money.\n23#Electric. They don't light up\n24#White Does Not Match Other Bestten White. These are easy to install but I will be returning them. Though they have a color description of white, they do not match the “white” of any of the other product lines and now their three-way white switches are unavailable. When placed next two the other switches, the difference in white is significant so I will need to piece-meal another brand to see how I can get all of these to match.\n25#Noisy clicker. Wanted a quiet switch. Unfortunately the material is very light plastic so it did not feel solid and makes a louder sound than my current switch. Please improve this product.\n26#Interruptores muy bonitos y a un muy buen precio. Los compre para renovar un apartamento y se ven muy bien, faciles de instalar y muy comodos al uso, lo mas importante el precio muy adecuado.\n27#Great price. Great price\n28#Finish screw less plate. finish screw less plates are not good, you are using two different types, one for your switches ( no good) and one for your receptacles ( good), the snap in mechanisms are not the same.\n29#Looks great, didn't empty the pocket. It's the little things that brighten ups a room and this is definitely one of them. When you have twenty to change out these are the top choice, least expensive but look nice.\n30#Saved. Great product Saved $ , when you buy packages,\n31#Nice, quality product. Nice, quality product\n32#Good buy. it's same quality, but cheaper than home depot\n33#Good quality and price! Great product, works well. Replaced most of the switches in my house and I’ll order more in the future. Thank you!\n34#High quality. Nice bulk pricing and great quality\n35#Screwless I guess means with screws ?? I specifically bought the 10pk of the screwless wall plate for my house and they came with the screws. Funny thing is even on the box it says that it should be screwless. So it must be Mis labeled from the manufacture. I’m remodeling my house and I don’t have time to wait for a replacement so I guess this will have to do.\n36#Affordable. Affordable and nice product, thank you\n37#just what I wanted. just what i was lookimg for, clean look and functional. replaced all the switches in my new home.\n38#Worth the money. Did the job for an affordable price!\n39#Good quality, Decora light switch. Good packaging, Good quality, no issues, durable, Decora/Rocker style light switches. I installed them in my house to upgrade older toggle switches.\n40#Great product. Perfect has expected\n41#Great switches. These switches look fantastic and easy to install.\n42#Easy to install. Excellent product.\n43#A little more frustrating than they needed to be. For the most part these are a breeze to install, but I had a few that had issues with the push in quick wire slots not tightening down, which meant switching to side wiring screws that I struggled with a lot more than I needed too because my house wire is so thick. The experience has put me off buying their receptacles with usb for fear that their quickwiring may be faulty.\n44#Nice product for the price ! Nice product for the price !\n45#Hard to install and don't work well. The way you connect the wires, it is hard to install. It is hard to adjust. We installed only two to find that both do not click well, one of them doesn't click in one direction at all and has to be pushed down really hard, beyond the normal end-position, to turn off. Returned based on poor quality.\n46#Delivery lie. Product is excellent, just as described. However, i have been having problems of late with Amazon delivery.\n47#Very happy with it. Very happy with it\n48#NOT Quiet. The item description should not include the word \"Quiet.\" This was the reason I purchased this item; however, they click as loudly as my current switch. I returned the item.",
