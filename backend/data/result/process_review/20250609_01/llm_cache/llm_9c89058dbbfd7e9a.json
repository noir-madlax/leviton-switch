The light defaults to ON after a power outage and there are no instructions to change that. Absolutely horrible if it happens at night!!!!\n1#Works out of the box. Purchased to allow remotely dimming/turning off lights from bed. Paired immediately and works great. I've had other name brands that struggled to cooperate. It's also apparently Alexa compatible, but I didn't need that. If you want the most reliable operation of this (or any) remote control, especially at greater distance, 2.4 is the way to go. You do not need the additional bandwidth 5GHz can provide in order to operate a light switch although this item does provide that frequency, and, if used in the same room as the switch, the remote should never have any trouble.\n2#Zero safety certifications. This is a very standard dimmer switch in terms of dimensions, which makes it easy to install. It has wire leads instead of screw terminals as the high-end brands. I 'was able to get them both tother in jar. Unfortunately, this device has zero safety certifications, no UL, no ETL and not even CE. So that doesn’t gives you confidence on product safety. It only has FCC certification but that one doesn’t cover safety. So keep that in mind. I wish they had their certifications since it seems like a well made product. I wish I could give them at least 4 stars but safety is very important for a device that is connected 24/7.\n3#How to stop flickering of LEDs. Unit works but LED started flickering; put in new dimmable bulbs, still flickers. Does unit need replaced?\n4#Ok. It has an electrical hum.\n5#Garbage! It's garbage, did not work. the instructions were not clear. Don't wasteb your money!!!\n6#Dimmer. Only dims half way.\n7#Works, but weird fit. It does the job but it's a bit bigger than your average light so if you're replacing an existing switch, adjustments may need to be made. Definitely doesn't fit in with a multiple switch situation either.\n8#Dimmer switch made a buzzing noise, had to return and get a brand name product. Dimmer switch made a buzzing noise, had to return and get a brand name product.\n9#works great Love it. i have two and it works great\n10#Great value & works great! The same switch was $25 for one and big bix store. Got 4 for $25 on Amazon. They work great and even have a remote for each one that has an optional wall mount. Highly recommend.\n11#Doesn’t work with Alexa. Doesn’t work with Alexa, instructions are so bad that it don’t even have the name and model of the product. Looks like it was just copied from name brand.\n12#Amazing. Needed a remote for light switch. 20 feet and through a concrete wall!!! Has a nice dim light on switch to find in the dark. I didn’t use Alexa options.\n13#Easy To Install. New dimmer & remote work great. Well worth the investment. Buy it. 1/15/25. Will not connect to Alexa. Discover new devices does nothing.\n14#Doesn't work. No customer service and the diagram shows a yellow wire that the unit dosent have. What a waste of time\n15#Blew fuse after 5 minutes. Thought it was a great price but I guess you get what you pay for.\n16#Perfect addition. This is just great, if you have a little bit of knowledge about electricity the installation is very easy, it works perfectly, the little remote is awesome and the alexa on and off feature is perfect. I will definitely buy more.\n17#Not good. Brightness range not adjustable. Too dim. The brightness range on these dimmer switches is not adjustable. At full power or brightness they are about 70% or so of normal on without the dimmer. The lower end of the range is not even usable. Definitely would recommend something else.\n18#Garbage. Don't waste your money 5 days after the warranty was up it stopped working\n19#Not worth the money. Very misleading write up. Not compatible with Alexa or any remote function.\n20#Dimming not great. It’s an ok product, it's not a great product. Everything works and it looks great but if you are a perfectionist this dimmer is not for you. The dimming is not smooth and it won't dim down to 0%. Only to ~ 25/30 %.. I'm a little disappointed but I’ll keep it. I don't want to spend $$$ for a better one. As they say “ you get what you pay for”\n21#Nice item. Great item, works great, a bit difficult to install .\n22#Works, but not amazing. First of all- it works. Lights turn on and off, dimmer works, remote all good. But that’s all. In hindsight I would have preferred to spend $20 more and get a name brand dimmer. -the wiring and the directions are NOT correct. The labels on the actual wires for “load”, “neutral”, “ground” do NOT match the colors and descriptions on the instructions. Extremely odd, and for someone with only a basic knowledge and comfort level in electrical work this really was not a fun experience installing. I had to trace around the wires on my wall and watch a few videos and really just make my best guess. -the actual wall unit and remote just feel cheap. Light plastic, not super flush and tight, creaks when a button is pressed… and you have to “push the buttons correctly”- hard and to the right. Lol. If you don’t, they don’t work. You could be sitting there pushing away with no result. It supposedly works with Amazon Alexa, although I have not tried it and don’t know how that would work anyway. Based on my experience so far it’s likely more trouble than it’s worth. I also don’t feel a need to verbally turn off my lights when I have a remote and also legs. These issues are the core of what matters for a dimmer switch other then “if it works”. So yes, it works. But assuming you don’t want to shut off your power and swap out light switches multiple times, just get a better one.\n23#Comes on full power after a power failure and need to be manually shut off. Very inconvenient as the power comes on full power after a power failure and must be manually turned off. This is a real problem if you are not at home or away for an extended time.\n24#Poor instructions could be dangerous! Attaching the wiring according to the rear of the device I found the hot and neutral wires mislabeled after it was installed (and not working). I then connected it the way it should be and the switch will turn the light on dim. Then when you press the {-} switch the light goes to full bright before you can turn it back down. This is one of the poorest devices I have ever wired. I would suggest going to Home Depot and getting a regular dimming switch because this device is not worth the money or the time to install it.\n25#Super convenient and easycto install. Switch was easy to install and very slick.\n26#Does not work as Advertised. This light switch will not stay connected to Alexa as it keeps dropping off, and now I cannot get even get it to connect to work through Alexa. So I decided to operate it as a normal on/off switch which it will work but in about 10 minutes after turning the lights on they start blinking on and off for no reason. I would return this item but unfortunately I am out of the 30 day window to do so. I would give this light switch a 0 star rating if that option was available. Don't waste your money.\n27#Needs different wiring. This could be an excellent product but not if your house does not have recent wiring. There is a red wire needed to wire it into the circuit and the electricians charge would be $325. I usually install these switches myself.\n28#don't buy this cheap thing. this switch flicker in low or high dim, very dissapointed with this item cheap made. had to connect the old one I have\n29#Answer to my problem. This was a great item and easy to install. I had two pendant light fixtures on one circuit but the light switch was behind a mirror. This fixed the problem and allowed my to place to on off switch remote to my exact preferred location. Wife is very happy\n30#Some show-stopping quirks. Attractive looking, with attractive price. Solves the problem of remote control of a single pole switch from any number of other locations without wiring. The remotes look good, like the more expensive pico remotes, and allow dimming at the remote. They fit nicely in a decora opening and seem to work reliably. However, there are some serious quirks. First of all, realize that this device only works with Alexa. It cannot be controlled with any other mobile app like most other wifi device. For example no control with Tuya or SmarLife apps like many chinese devices sold on Amazon can be. Secondly, when power goes out and comes back on, these switches will turn the light on which will stay on till you turn it off. This created a problem for me as I was installing the switch at a remote home where I am not there all the time, and we lose power there a lot. Without an app to control it, I can't turn things off after a power outage and the lights stay on till we visit the house again weeks later. This should not be the normal behavior and the switch should either revert to off or to its pre-outage state. Additionally, I don't use Alexa and it does not provide easy scheduling controls like other mobile apps.\n31#Didn't work right out of the box. Per instruction- red to the line, blue to the load, white- neutral, and green to ground. No light in the switch with correct wiring. Then flipped the line and load- light in the switch but not light at the load. After trial and error, decided that it's a dud and returning it.\n32#Good switch. So first there were differences on support for Google, it doesn't have it! Second it says 5g support which is really what I wanted but it doesn't support 5g. Now for the rest it work perfectly, it cheap enough price wise, but Alexa found the units with zero issues. It was quick and easy install. I do have one issue that I will work on thinking it might be the bulbs but at full power the light bulbs flicker, but all other settings work great. So we shall see the other lights have not had an issue yet. No app to download so that was a nice plus.\n33#Good quality smart switch, some drawbacks. This single pole smart switch and remote set, works well in several configurations to add additional functionality and smart capabilities to your existing single pole or 3 way light switches. The instructions for single pole are straightforward, but it can get very complex when converting an existing 3way switch, so this single pole plus remote, you essentially have to disable/bypass one switch of the 3way circuit and place and use the remote as though it was the other switch in the circuit. Once completed, it looks like a much more expensive well known brand of smart switch, and Alexa learns it's presence once power is reconnected. On/off and dimming functions work via voice command and button input on the switch or remote, but every so often, the remote will fail to connect and all buttons will be unresponsive with no LED's illuminated. Cycling the light off then off again usually corrects this error, but it happens frequently enough to be an annoyance. Also this switch cannot be controlled by Google or anything but Alexa so keep your personal ecosystem in mind when getting this, but if you don't mind those small annoyances this is a great affordable smart light switch for you.\n34#AAAAAAA+++++ SELLER !! Well-made !! Quick ship !! Looks Classy !! AAAAAAA+++++ SELLER !! Well-made !! Quick ship !! Looks Classy !!\n35#Doesn't work. The unit came in but while reading the instructions I noticed that wire labels were already installed. So wasn't sure how to hook it up since they were labeled wrong according to the instructions. I wired it up by the labels but it didn't work. Finally got it to work but won't shut off. Believe this was a used unit. Very disappointed.\n36#East install. Works very good. The dimmer is not too good. Remote, on and off function work well\n37#Works Great! I have my light switch behind my 55” Sony HDTV. This switch is an RF switch(radio frequency) switch. doesn’t to be line-of-sight. Works perfectly! With Alexa you a not only can you turn lights on/off, but Alexa will dim and brighten your lights by voice command. VERY COOL!\n38#Product is noise after install. The switch makes a continuous noise. It doesn’t worth it\n39#Iys a three way switch without wiring. Mo wiring and you have three way switch\n40#Lights auto on after power loss. At first I loved it as a cheap alternative, there’s a low electronic hum sound when you dim the lights which was annoying but the switch is far enough away from the bed that it was fine. Biggest issue is that whenever there is a power surge or if the power goes out and comes back on the lights automatically come on. This is not fun in the bed room all night long. Might uninstall and return for this reason as we frequently get power surges during nor’easters in New England\n41#Perfect item! Just what we were looking for to turn lights on in backyard from inside the house! Great quality and price!\n42#Affordable Lutron Caseta Knock Off. Let's call a spade a spade Lutron's patent expired and with it their strangle hold on the RF wireless switch market This is a cheaper looking clone and exact right down to the cheaper looking markings on the buttons Works well and half the price No idea on longevity Picture of original attached\n43#Smart switch! Cheap and easy way to convert your home into a smart home\n44#Short range. Was disappointed with the range on remote\n45#Got a dud - puts out 43 volts all on or off. I received a dud. The switch is wired correctly (I am an electrical engineer and certified master electrician). The lights immediately came on dim when the switch was off. I tested turning it on and off and adjusting the dimmer up and down. I measured 43 volts (load to neutral) no matter what settings I tried. I will send this back and will try again. If the second attempt disappoints me, I'm done with this product.\n46#Works, but can't be used due to horrible buzzing noise during use. Buttons don't feel too cheap, and I like that you can move the remote wherever you need it (within reason). But when the lights are switched on, there is a loud sustained buzzing noise that is absolutely unacceptable for a residential installation. It's too bad, I really wanted to use these.\n47#I've tried. Turned out that I had only two cables when I removed old switch, so, I've tried anyway, it was flickering really bad, I guess it might be because I don't have a neutral cable.\n48#We replaced it within 2 weeks. We used this for our master closet. It made a buzzing sound constantly that drove me crazy and the lights would sometimes flicker. Instead of fussing with finding the right pairing of light bulbs like some people seem to have had luck doing, we gave up and just used a different switch. Not worth it.",
