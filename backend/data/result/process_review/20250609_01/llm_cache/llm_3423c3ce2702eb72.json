These switches have worked well since installing them several months ago however they are pretty noisy and sometimes difficult to switch as they seem to want to stay in the on or off position. Flipping one of these switches in a room where someone is sleeping will most definitely wake them up if they are a light sleeper.\n1#Happy Return Customer. I have bought these switches and the brand several times and am very impressed.\n2#üëçüëçüëç. alunbran percferto\n3#Nice but the lights are DIM. Install was quick and easy. I am not an electrician. Just simply locate the breaker and process with caution. Match the wire connectors. My reason for a 3 STAR is the light emitting was low/dim. Does not match up with other similar products I have used in the past. ~GKZ\n4#Excellent. Works great. Bought many items and products.\n5#Nightlight not bright. Easy to install but nightlight not bright enough\n6#New paddle switch. These are easy to replace. I used them on my hallway. The led lights come on when the hallway darkens. Works well for seeing at night.\n7#Love these. Incredible amount of light for the small area where the lights are. Shines up or down, which is good for a three way where down isn't always off. The day/night sensor (the tiny hole in the switch) is sensitive. Sometimes walking past will make the light come on, but no big thing. Now I don't have to try to walk around in the dark!\n8#Works great. These 3 way switches work great.\n9#Good night-light. It is bright enough at night to avoid turning on an overhead light. I use it at the foot of the stairs.\n10#Very nice. Add s just enough light in an interior hall to aid in maneuvering at night.\n11#Love the Look. Love the little LEDS under the switch. Just enough light at night to highlight the floor and makes the house look cozy. Perfect for bathrooms as well. I'm putting them all over the house. I used one Rocker Light per gang box no matter how many switch's. Make sure to buy the switch with the 3 Way. Incase the light can be turned off and on by a different switch. They are not Motion Detected they light up in low light. Love them.\n12#Night light only shines upward. Picture shows night light shining up, or down. You‚Äôll want it pointing down, away from your eyes at night. But to do that, the switch has to be installed upside down, where ‚Äúon‚Äù is flipping the toggle down to the ‚Äúoff‚Äù position. You‚Äôll understand better when you buy it, install it, reinstall it, flip it over, repeat and just leave it in the on position when off. Enjoy lol\n13#These are a great way to use them like night lights. I switched over most of my house with these. These are great. They are as advertised. I have purchased 15 of these and I have only had a problem with two of them. One had a dim lite and the other switch does not always work which I have to replace.\n14#Weak light. Barely any light comes out of them meh at best\n15#Do not buy - low quality. Total waste of money. I bought a few products from this brand and had 3 of them break within 9 months of installation. All broke in the same exact way (the plastic joint in the middle of the switch erodes and then pops out). Totally flimsy/low quality design. Highly advise anyone to stay away from these products.\n16#Three or four way. Great switches! Gives off a nice glow when dark. Very helpful for finding a switch in the dark!!\n17#NO ES WI_FI !!!!!!!!!! Watch out... IT is no Wi-Fi switch !!!\n18#Works good while it lasts. Installation procedure is exactly same as replacing any switch; not easy not difficult. Works as expected. I was happy with it until it lasted. One of the button out of 2 pack stopped staying on in one year usage. Other button gave out after 2 years of usage. Overall I think quality of the product can be improved.\n19#Bad quality. These are trash\n20#Not bright enough. The lights are not bright enough\n21#great night light. great product\n22#Such a great setup for hallway light switches! I have two sets of these installed in my home. Both locations are stairs with the top location being a stair/ hallway setup. These lights are powerful enough to make it easy to navigate to the switch without being a bothersome. (too bright) I love the ambient light sensor to help minimize running the night light when it is not necessary. When it comes to installing it was very easy to install. However, if you don't understand basic wiring of a three-way switch, I would highly recommend that you watch several YouTube videos and take a picture of the current switch setup before you remove the old switch. These are light years cheaper than going to the big box stores. I highly recommend purchasing these switches!\n23#flickers bad on all units. Installed in our house and the light flickers horribly. Installed on a friends house and did the same. Defective product.\n24#Looks good. Works as advertised\n25#Not a night light. Does not actually provide a \"night light\" as stated and shown in ad. The LED lights will minimally indicate where the light switch with a very minimal reflection on the wall, and the LEDs flicker somewhat. The paddle is very noisy. Will be looking for a different brand, such as Leviton, to replace these. Don't waste your money.\n26#Na. Easy to install\n27#I love these light switches! We have a dark hallway and both switches are at the very far ends. These new lighted ones illuminates the hallway just enough to see where I'm going, but not too much to wake me up. Great find!\n28#Make sure you know what 3 Way switch means. This doubles as a night light and has saved me from many toe stubs and stepping on sharp kids toys at night. A three way switch is if you have two switches on the same light. the north door to my kitchen has a switch but I can turn the light on or off at the south door as well. This is a 3 way switch.\n29#3 Way nightlight switch. Works perfectly in my dark hall at night. Safe easy to install\n30#Installed and didn‚Äôt work. Installed them to replace working switches. I checked the diagram to confirm everything would swap to the right post. The switches would not work properly. I considered calling an electrician and eventually put the old switches back and everything worked. One of the two switches sent was bad. Unfortunately I‚Äôm past my return date. I‚Äôd recommend going with a more vetted brand from one of the big box stores.\n31#Not a true 3-way switch. To start, this switch does not operate like a conventional 3-way switch because your main switch will need to be in the on position in order for the 2nd/slave switch to function. The only thing I like about this switch is that it serves as a night light or location light so you don't fumble around in the dark to locate the switch.\n32#Buen precio por lo que estas comprando. Buen precio por lo que estas comprando\n33#Nice Light But Not Long lasting. Nice illuminated switch, but a few light diodes stopped working. It‚Äôs been installed less than six months.\n34#Works Great! Easy to install and does just want I was looking for! Gives a great ambient glow adding some light to a stairwell without being too bright at night.\n35#Better than expected. Perfect. These have a tiny nightlight to help you navigate at night. Installed in our bathroom.\n36#These Things Are Sweet. Neat concept. Works well. Highly recommended.\n37#Great Value. Bought this to see if it would work the way I wanted to and it does. I didn‚Äôt want it to be so bright but obviously able to see in a dark hallway. Works great and has lights above and below in case other side is flipped the opposite way. Install took maybe 5-10 min. What took the longest time was figuring out which breaker (not properly labeled) was for the switch I was working on. Other than that fast, easy and works as described. I plan on buying another set for my garage. Since it has a sensor the light did shut off when I pointed the light at it.\n38#LED brightness is just right as both a nightlight and for finding the switch in the dark. Installed this in my upstairs hallway which was always pitch dark at night and it was hard to find the light switch. This makes it both easy to find the switch as well as provides just the right amount of light for use as a night light.\n39#Nice to have in dark areas. It solved the problem of finding the switch in dark spots.\n40#Both suddenly stopped working after being installed for 5 months. WARNING: Both stopped working after being installed for five months. The return time has now closed and we are most disappointed!\n41#Nice concept, but not very bright. Functions fine as a rocker switch. And though the switch does illuminate, it is not bright at all. Not worth $10 per switch.\n42#Great swtiches. Installed easy. The night lights are super. They are both ends of the switch.\n43#Easy to install. Difficult to find 3 way switches that are easy to find in the dark. These are great for a dark hallway.\n44#Beware: Stopped working soon after warranty expired. Bought two; using one as single pole and the other as three-way. The illumination LED on the three way stopped working one month after warranty expired. Looking elsewhere for replacement.\n45#DO NOT BUY. Switch does not work! Night light doesn‚Äôt work and switch does not turn light on. It‚Äôs complete crap\n46#works nice. it took some time in getting this wired correctly. but am glad we have it. night lights when room is dark. we used it in our Jack and Jill bathroom. we are happy with the switches. might get another set for the stairs.\n47#They look good but two of the switches stop working. Product looks good, but two of the switches they stopped working. I wish the company would be nice enough to replace them.",
