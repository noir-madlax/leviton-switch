Kind of don't like the plate. But it's good ! The switch looks and feels great to use. I don't like the wall plate. Kind of moves around when you bump it but if it was screws then you would see the screws. So I guess it's ok. Easy to install. The switch works. Has a green indicator light so you can find it in the dark. I bought 2 of them and they both really work good. A must have if your light is too bright like mine was. Gives me control of my light brightness. Can't beat the price. Do not notice any delay when using it. Connected to my wires without any issues.\n1#Stops working after a year. Bad flickering. Stopped working after a year. Started flickering really bad and then just stopped working.\n2#Good value. Good dimmer plates. Easy to install.\n3#Great value. Great value and work perfectly\n4#Slide up/ slide down. Please have electrician install. Very functional and looks great.\n5#Very Disappointed - Switches Have a High Failure Rate! Please Note: This review is of the Cloudy Bay Smart Dimmer Switches shown in the photos. This listing on Amazon has apparently been updated by the seller to reflect a different Cloudy Bay Switch that I have no experience with but if you review their entire listing you will still see this version referenced in photos and the product comparison chart. Purchased 8 (4 -2 packs) of the switches shown in the picture for my home remodel and after only a few months, 4 of the 8 switches have either failed completely or exhibited odd/glitchy behavior that could not be corrected. I replaced 2 with identical units (on my dime) trying to give the product the benefit of the doubt thinking I may have just received a couple duds but now that 2 more have acted up I have decided to remove all of them for safety concerns and replace them with TP Link products that I have had ZERO problems with in the past. Perhaps this is why Cloudy Bay no longer has this switch available in the listing but this is where my order history links so this is where I am leaving this review. The lesson here folks, at least for me, is to remember the saying of Buy Once, Cry Once. I took a chance on a different Smart Dimmer Switch with Alexa Integration to try and save some money but the amount of time and money this experience has cost me was absolutely not worth it! I should've just paid the extra money for the switches I had a solid experience with and moved on. Now, to be fair, I have not reached out to Cloudy Bay to attempt warranty repair/replacement since I have NO desire to put their products back in my walls given the high failure rate. I'm sure I am past any warranty window so all I can do is post my experience here for others to see and let them decide if they want to take a chance with Cloudy Bay products or not. If the seller would like these switches returned for research please reach out to me with a shipping label and I will gladly send them back to you if it might help as they are of no use to me at this point and are heading to the landfill soon.\n6#Switch. Good value, works as expected.\n7#Cloudy Bay Product Excellent. Cloudy Bay Product Excellent, Amazon Shipped fast and it definitely fit the need I had. Very good easy install item accurate description and I am very pleased.\n8#Started flickering, had to replace. It went in just fine and worked for two months and then started to flicker with my LED bathroom light. Both light and Cloudy Bay switch were supposed to be LED compatible. I see now where others have complained about flicker in this product. I replaced it with a Leviton. Problem fixed at least for now. Definitely won't buy this brand again.\n9#Hardly dims at all. Regardless of where I set the adjustment dial, I couldn't get more than about 20% dimming on my LEDs. Definitely sending this back. Edited to add two stars because a more expensive dimmer acted strange as well. Maybe the problem is not the dimmer.\n10#Typical dimmer, works okay - UPDATE: lasted less than a year. (1) Does NOT dim as low as stated, but it's acceptable. (2) Tricky to install in a standard outlet box. UPDATE 6/2024: (3) LASTED LESS THAN A YEAR. The slide feature shorts out, so it's unusable as a dimmer, but okay as a regular switch.\n11#Nice look. It’s a switch. Not much to say. Works fine. Looks good.\n12#Easy install! Loved the ease of the install. Performs perfectly. Great deal for the money.\n13#Easy to install, good quality! It is definitely something we needed in our bathroom.\n14#Burned out in less then a year. I bought this in July of 2022 and it failed today. It hasn't been a year.\n15#Couldn't use. Had these installed but had to take down. It dimmed like it was suppose to but it caused my chandelier to flicker so went with the normal switch I had prior. No more flickering, I even had the recommended disable lights\n16#nice. good product\n17#Just what I need it. Works like a charm\n18#Easy to install. Very easy to install and I like the sliding motion.\n19#works like it should. replaced an standard switch with this it has worked fine\n20#Stopped dimming fairly soon after install. No longer dims. Slide works. Light is no full pwr no matter where the slide is. Waiting for company reply.\n21#Worked with my Led lights. Installed this for an under shelf light set up, work perfect.\n22#Great dimmer! my kitchen light switch is behind the fridge so this is perfect because of the low profile functionality. you need about a finger's width of room to turn on/off and dim.\n23#Right price. Easy-to-use\n24#Ok product. Product looks cheap\n25#works great! follow the instructions. they work great, follow the instructions and know a little about how to wire a plug or light switch and you will be fine\n26#It was easy to install. I was able to replace the 10 years old dimmer switch with this one with existing wiring, and it comes with the plate The dimmer and on off switch works fine, and it was a 3 ways setup.\n27#Duel front panel PITA. The dimmer works well, the low light adjustment is a good feature. The duel front panel is pita, a single panel would work fine, I don't care if the two switch mounting screws are exposed. I won't buy this again\n28#Works great. Dimmer works great in my living room.\n29#Good dimmers. Easy to use! Use to control kitchen ceiling light, easy to use. Love it!\n30#Junk. Bought two of these. After a few weeks, one started tripping my breaker. The other one had to eventually be replaced too because even if you turned the switch, the lights would still be on. Just buy better quality ones. Worth the money.\n31#It didn't turn off the lights. Even at the lowest power and after adjusting the custom setting my lights wouldn't turn off. Seems like a basic thing to get wrong. I expect my lights to turn off if I turn the switch off.\n32#Took an hour of diagnosis... Took an hour of diagnosis...and ultimately trying a spare switch I had on hand to learn that this was garbage right out of the box! Returning item. It simply didn't work! Would like to invoice manufacturer for my wasted, aggravating time.\n33#Excellent. I set the lower level adjustment for my dimmed setting, higher than just powering up to LED level, and it's so convenient. 100 percent level of slider is actually 100 percent. Nice.\n34#Excellent quality and does exactly what it is supposed to do! Really nice and sturdy quality item. Well designed and works perfectly. Can be used on single-pole or double-pole light switch. Worked great with my LED light fixture over the dining table. Nice to be able to cut it down so that it isn't so overpowering. Item has large back so make sure you have plenty of space in the outlet reservoir. I had to fish wiring through back a bit so that everything would fit correctly. attached plates and everything works perfectly. No issues at all!\n35#Made to last. I’ve owned one for about twelve years with no problems. The only reason I’m replacing it now was a ladder fell against it while painting. A great product you’ll love!\n36#Great service and product. Great service and product\n37#Works. Switch itself is working fine and was not that hard to install. Wish they or industry could come up with different design for yellow connectors that joins 2 wires. For small enclosures where there is not enough room getting the 2 wires into the yellow coupling/connector hole is tedious. Am sure a better design could accomplish what current one does.\n38#Make sure you have dimmable LED's. Bought a 2 pack, ended up getting a 3rd because the kids wanted them in both rooms and the wife also wanted one in our room. Make sure you have dimmable LED's... ours initially didn't work until we got the right kind of LED loads.\n39#Not happy, won't buy them again. when you slide the lever all the way down to the bottom, the lights are still on. They don't go completely off. I'm thinking isn't that what it's supposed to do?\n40#Works as expected. Works as it should and at a much lower price than the big box stores!\n41#Straight Forward Installation. Worked perfectly on my two pole with ground. Most really work fine without one I've found on other dimmer installs in the home that didn't have one in the box\n42#Life Saver. Had an old one for the entertainment area in My basement and my daughter hates it. Well, one night I broke it by accident and now everyone has to dim the light using force. I saw this one on Amazon and installed it without telling my family and joy 🤩 on their faces when they realized it’s not the old one was priceless. Recommendation Guaranteeeeeeeeed!👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽\n43#Works as expected. Like that it has a light so you can see it in the dark.\n44#Led lights flicker randomly. Dimmable LED light lights flicker randomly\n45#Good switch. You never want a cheap dimmer. Especially with LED lamps. This is one of the good ones\n46#Excellent switch (no mention of range adjustment wheel). Unlike the switch this replaced, there is no flickering with dimmable LED lamps. (Well it does flicker for a second and then it's steady.) At first moving the slide control down didn't dim the lights. Then I noticed a tiny dimming range control wheel on the right side of the switch. The dimmer range control is neither visible nor accessible after installing the switch cover plate. After adjusting the dimmer range control to allow the slide control to work, I installed the cover plates and all was good. There should be but there isn't any mention of the dimmer range control in the installation / operation manual that comes with the switch.",
