After turning lights on they would start flickering regardless of how dim or bright they were set to. Replaced with another brand switch which works perfectly.\n1#Great Product & Price. Great product at a great price.\n2#Dimmer switch. Exactly what I needed for a kitchen light fixture. Works great.\n3#Works fine. Switch is easy to install and works fine. It is wider than a non-dimming SPST switch so a little space is needed in the box. Works with standard and LED lights.\n4#Good for dimmable LED bulbs. Perfect replacement for dimmable led bulbs.\n5#Used to dimmer mod my espresso machine, turning it into a flow control monster! I used this dimmer switch to do the dimmer mod on my Breville Infuser espresso machine. It was an easy install and works great, no compatibility issues with my machine's electronics/programming. The switch has turned my Infuser into a flow control machine that rivals higher end machines costing thousands of dollars more. One of the best bang for the buck I ever made.\n6#Performs well and fits tight box space. Good bargain priced dimmer, I wanted the 1970's rotary look. Compact switch size, I have two switches in a 2-gang box with enough room for connections and a pass-thru branch. One switch controls LED an LED branch and one controls incandescents. The incandescent dim almost all they way, probably around 98%. Nice and smooth, no issues. The LED's do not dim nearly as dark, probably 90 to 95%. The LED brand I am using claims 95% dimmable so I don't know if a more expensive dimmer would go much darker. There is no flicker or buzz with either the LEDs or incandescents. Knob is twist on, NOT a push knob. Comes with three interchangeable knob colors, white, light almond and a slightly darker classic ivory.\n7#Perfect. work properly\n8#Not push on/off switch. Not push on/off as listed in description. Description listed \"Action: Push for On/Off, Rotary control for lighting level control\". Otherwise the dimmer function worked well on the 8\" circular dimmable led ceiling light I had installed. Returned.\n9#Not as advertised. Turns out that the description: \"Action: Push for On/Off, Rotary control for lighting level control,\" is wrong. There is no push function at all. Instead you rotate it to turn on and off.\n10#It works. No flickering or noise, works without force, looks no noticeable.\n11#dimmer. works as it should\n12#Works smoothly. Works perfectly. Easy to install and smooth operation. I did have to replace my bulbs with \"dimmable\" versions but I expected that.\n13#Excellent Choice: Quality Construction, Ease to install & Use. The people at Leviton produced an excellent product. Their rotary dimmer switch for our dimmable LED lights performs as we hoped. As said, it is has the rotary behavior, not the push in option, which what we preferred. Very smooth and it looks great. Also there's no need to buy a light plate. The rotary knob covers the hole in the plate beautifully. Also, very helpful. Supply are three different color knobs, which helps in most applications, except black. Again, an excellent choice. Question, please ask. Amazon will patch you through and one of us will step up to help.\n14#Worked to replace our old one. Liked that this came with wires attached to connect to our supply wires. The first item we ordered had side screws,(no wires) which made it harder to hook up. This one worked well. Pull yours out off wall to check if you need the wires. Is not a push off/on, just a dial.\n15#Simple solution. Exactly as advertised. Easy install\n16#did all it was mean,t todo. what else do i need to do i gave u acomment add aheadline c,mon guys u want a revue lighten up.\n17#Why didn't I think of this MUCH sooner? When I tried to replace my existing dimmer - I was stymied. The HomeDepot one was standard but the one in place was a Leviton. The wiring was different. Thought that I would need an electrician. Finally thought - just by another Leviton dimmer! Easy install. Only thing I had to get used to was that it wasn't a push on / push off. It's a rotate - from OFF to ON to brightness as chosen.\n18#Missing ivory and almond knobs. This is actually a five-star product, works great on dimmable LED bulbs. I knocked off three stars because the package had been opened, ivory and almond knobs removed, then taped to close it again. I had to call Leviton and the ivory knob I wanted will arrive in 10-14 days. Shame on Amazon for shipping this opened package with parts missing. Shame on Amazon for making this the only way I can tell them it sucks to receive a previously opened package. Not Leviton’s fault.\n19#Be sure to choose bulb carefully. Lots to like about this product. BE SURE to go to the Leviton web site and look up compatible bulbs. The list is surprisingly short. This switch did not work with Linkind dimmable bulbs - flickered. BTW, Linkind works great with other dimmers in the house, so no bad words for that company. Did not give 5 stars because it is picky about the brand of bulb.\n20#Works Fine With LED Spot Lamp. A bit more expensive than typical dimmers but it does work with our kitchen recessed LED flood lamp without issue. Getting another now that we see it working.\n21#DIms like it should. Used for a specific type of LED driver which required this form of dimmer switch. Dims very well.\n22#Perfect. this turned out to be an exact replacement part, was able to install in under four minutes, works perfectly. Very happy.\n23#NOT TOO BRIGHT. EREPLACED MY LIGHT SWITCH BECAUSE I INSTALLED LED BULBS ,WELL MY LIGHTS STILL FLICKER EVEN THOUGH IT WAS FOR LED BULBS. HAVE TO TRY SOMETHINGELSE I GUESS.\n24#Good Product. I'm a long way from an electrician but I didn't know rheostat light dimmers would eventually fail after 30 some-odd years. Using a voltage tester I got on Zon, I proved the problem to the old switch, bought this Leviton switch and reinstalled it. Prob solved and I managed not to kill myself.\n25#I looked for this style knob with a turn to off. This switch had a turn to off\n26#No offset. Works as described. Old push click by Leviton lasted 32-years of daily use in kitchen. Only problem is this one has no offset in the metal face which keeps the cover plate from being flat to the wall. Had to grind down some ribs on the back side of a four-gang wall plate. No biggie.\n27#Does not dim!? Professional installation. I had this professionally installed by a well known electrical contractor but it does not dim? It comes on just fine but turning the knob does nothing..this was a replacement for our previous dining room light..same brand... Which dimmed just fine! I'm not going to pay the electrician again to change this! Very disappointed!!\n28#Didn't work very well on LED lights. Didn't work very well on LED lights\n29#Hallelulah, no flickering! \\\\(*.*)/. Finally, a rotary dial dimmer for LEDs. I had looked around quite a bit for this type of dimmer switch for my recessed LED lights to match the other switches in our house. The Lutron, I bought previously would turn off when dimmed low, or cause flickering. This one works GREAT!\n30#Nice switch. Nice switch. Easy to install and works great. Good for the money.\n31#Works. Fixed the problem Thanks\n32#This one has a Off/On switch when Knob is turned. This is a good product that has been around a long time.\n33#This is a great dimmer for incandescents! It works well and was easy to replace.\n34#Great for dimmable string lights on my parents patio. This switch works great to brighten or dim the porch string lights!\n35#Works great with LED Panel. I moved into a house built in the 1930s and found that the 80 year old electrical system has smaller junction boxes than today's houses. This dimmer is a little smaller than most and fits in the junction box with enough room for the wires. It doesn't have the holes where you push the wires into the switch, you wire it together with the house wires with wire nuts. I would have preferred to have a traditional switch, but I can easily live with the rotary knob. It comes with 3 different colored knobs, white and two shades of off white.\n36#Leviton Rotary dimmer. I had an old one after 35 years broke down,press down to turn on,this newer one all you need is turn keep rotate will increse or decrease the brightness,I brought two same model,they both have different colors wire for HOT (power source),all you need to turn off breaker,a cheap power tester only cost few dollars,electrian tape another few dollars ,single blade razor from Hardware store ,screw driver ,don,t drop the screws,make sure proper alignment when install the screw.\n37#Does not switch On/Off at any position. Must be rotated to activate. The labeling seems to indicate that the lights can be switched on / off at any position. This is not correct. The with must be rotated each and every time to the dimmest setting before being able to access on / off. Otherwise works well and installation is simple.\n38#Only worked for less than a year. Pretty simple to install and worked as advertised, but only for several months. Have to replace it now that it is flakey. Light goes out with no warning and lots of lickering when operating the dimmer. Cheap Chinese crap...\n39#Dims the lights. Works as advertised. Dims LED lamps from very low to full brightness. No flicker. No buzzing. Good price. Easy straight forward instillation.\n40#Best switch. Perfect Fit!!!\n41#fit perfectly. ease of install\n42#Try to install right away, so you can return it does t work. My husband installed just a week ago and is already glitching, not worth it for the money\n43#it works. it works just fine\n44#easy to install and works! bought this to control the brightness of 5000k daylight ceiling fan light. Fairly simple to install, just like replacing any other switch. one thing tho...I had a switch for light and one for the fan, after replacing, I need to keep both switches on for the dimmer switch to work. Not a problem, but something to keep in mind. Other wise works great, levels of brightness from very dim to very bright are easy to control. extra knobs are handy to color match!\n45#Good low priced dimmer. This dimmer switches on like a radio knob. I thought it was push on/off. Not a problem. Dimmable CFL bulbs are a bit noisy with it. Should be quiet with LED bulbs.\n46#Dimmer. Works well. I just wanted a simple dimmer that worked well with LED bulbs and this works perfect. Very simple installation. Good purchase would definitely buy again\n47#Not what vendor description says - is not push on/push off. Description says Push on/off from vendor while product delivered is not push on ! Leviton RNL06-10Z Trimatron Universal Rotary Dimmer Trimatron lighting controls are traditional rotary-style dimmers available in single-pole (one location) and 3-way (multi-location) Push-On/Push-Off versions for LED, CFL and incandescent lighting and quiet fan speed control.

Thai was relatively easy to install to replace an older dimmer switch. It fits in a standard electrical box & uses the standard switch cover plate. If you have dimmable LED lights, you need this. The older dimmers cause a flicker with LEDs, due to the lower current draw.",
