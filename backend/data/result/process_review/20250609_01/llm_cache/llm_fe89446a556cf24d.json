Does not connect to wifi no matter what I do. Really unfortunate.\n1#Pick something else. This switch lasted 6 months exactly, and then became completely unresponsive to the physical controls over the last 2 weeks. Don’t waste your time on this one.\n2#Inferior app! Change your Wi-Fi and all hell breaks lose. The app won't help to connect this device to a new Wi-Fi network. It won't help you to add the switch again with the hope that it will let you connect to the new Wi-Fi. The app's add-device function won't find the switch, so it tells you to put the switch in a pairing mode, but there is no where to tell you how to put the switch in the pairing mode. You can try to add the device manually, but the app would make you search through dozens of different devices, and my smart switch device is not on the list. There is no search function to find your device without manually browsing through their dozens of devices. The more I write this review, the more mad I'm at the company for their laziness, the more I reduced the number of stars. It's down to one star now.\n3#Great feature but poor reliability. Really like the feature of this switch, it controls my bath room light and vent with timed turn-off. However, the physical button becomes unresponsive after 1 year of use. Will buy from reputable brand next time.\n4#Good. Switch works as intended haven’t had a issue yet and owned for over a year.\n5#Bad switch. Bad device. We are not a year in yet, and it stopped working. Lasted about 7 months.\n6#Good value. Connected to the wifi with no problems. Looks nice. Quality is good. Switch is push button. These are early to clean. This is a good bang for ur buck. Definitely recommend\n7#Within less than 6 months they all stop working. Everything was good: installed, easy app & configuration, integration with google home. But then within 3-6 months all of them stopped working. I install about 10 of them and pretty much all stop responding to the button. Control from the app works but the switch itself does not. I would recommend not to use them ever.\n8#Sleek and smart switch. Very nice and neat looking switch. Easy to install and simple to connect to the wifi. Looks good quality and works without any problem.\n9#no hub required. 1 gang size (they are all 1 gang size) (the listing uses the term \"gang\" to refer to how many buttons it has). 1 gang is the standard size light switch size that you will see in 99% of US households works with alexa and google assistant. i only use google and it works fine no hub required\n10#Very convenient. connecting to Alexa for easy on/off control. , but since it's a smart switch, having Alexa to manage the switch is better than manually. This way, build quality isn't an issue.. The design is simple, and installed very easy\n11#Great product. I got it for my room and it is very easy to use. Will order another for kids room as well\n12#Stoped working. Had about a year and switch stopped working. Had electrician out to diagnose and switch is no longer sending voltage to device.\n13#powerful. nice double light switch easy to install nice to have different levels of lighting\n14#High quality and low price. This is a great switch and easy to use and install. Love what it does. The price is better than the big box store.\n15#Works as intended. It works as intended and is pretty easy to install\n16#Smart switch works. The things I really like about the switch is the ease of use. The switch connects up with no issues and works with my favorite AI lady Alexa turn off the lights!\n17#Buenisimo. Demasiado bueno, es súper fácil de instalar. Y su función es buenisima! Lo recomiendo mucho!\n18#Smart Switch. The switches are great. Easy to install and work perfectly nb\n19#Great Upgrade. My dad loves these smart lights, it is a game changer since he can use it with alexa and his phone so he does not have to get up to turn his lights on and off. Great gift for parents and elderly!\n20#Easy install. It came with proper installation instructions so was not very difficult to install. The size matches with standard switches so didn't need to cut anything. Was easy to connect and works quite well with Google assistant.\n21#Great Smart light switch. Loving these MOES Smart Double Light Switches! They've completely transformed my home into a smart haven. The installation was straightforward, and the app setup was quick and simple. Now the lights are controlled by voice or my iPhone. Switch functions well and blends with the other switches throughout my apartment. I linked it with my Google Home too.\n22#Half the price and twice as good. I love this!! I was going to get a smart switch from Home Depot but i saw this and it was half the price so i thought might as well. And it’s amazing!\n23#works great! wifi is great. Control using Alexa. will purchase more.\n24#Product is OK. App is trash. Use SmartLife instead. I bought this switch with a specific purpose in mind. I wanted to convert a double gang set of switches to one slot so I could install an outlet in the other. One of the switches to be replaced controls the light in a walk in closet. I like motion switches for closets, but this one is on a wall outside the closet. So, by making it a smart switch I could put a stand alone motion detector inside the closet and set routines to turn it on and off. This switch fit the bill. Physical installation was straightforward and easy. Find the supply hot wire and both loads, hook to the marked terminals at the top of the switch. Add a jumper from the neutral wires since the old switches were load only. I followed the directions and downloaded the MOES app and created an account. Tried to add the switch and it warned me about 2.4 GHz wifi only. My ISP provided gateway REALLY wants you to use the same SSID for 5 and 2.4 GHz networks and it is a PITA to change it. I had a 2.4 only extender available and switch my phone to it and was able to set up the switch. Then I went to set up the link to my SmartThings app so I could control it with a Zigbee motion detector. The instructions told me to link SmartLife, which I had already done for some smart plugs I have had for a couple of years. That's when I figured out the MOES app is just a pared down version of SmartLife. Deleted the switch from the MOES app and opened SmartLife. The switch was already detected and added with a single click. SmartLife then made it available to SmartThings and I was able to set the routines using my Third Reality motion detector. So, my advice is skip the MOES app and use SmartLife instead. Integration to SmartThings and Alexa are easier.\n25#As an electrician. Works great, looks great, totally worth it\n26#Exactly what I needed. Been looking for a wifi smart switch that works as manual switch . After series or purchases and trials , I finally got the one that does exactly what I wanted . Happy with this purchase . I can now go ahead and turn all of my regular switches to this .\n27#Easy to use interface. Very easy to use outlet, just make sure its 2.4ghz band. Easy set up.\n28#Le faltan tornillos de conexión parece algo usado. Esto es un desastre total. Después de tanta espera.de este.producto NO LO COMPRES!!! Dont buy this product is inconplete and damage !!\n29#Works perfect easy to install. Nice finish and easy to access\n30#Terrible quality. After three months using the switch stopped working, doesn’t turns on the lights manually and doesn’t connect to the network. Terrible product\n31#Working fine. Works great manually or through Alexa.\n32#Value for money. Easy to install, value for money, fit is perfect\n33#nice solid light switch. My husband installed it and it works flawlessly and looks wonderful! Instructions provided were great and installation is really easy. These switches only work on 2.4GHz which I should've checked before I ordered, but it isn’t a problem for me since our network has both. The device works with the Tuya Smart app. which I was already familiar with because of some other appliances in the house. These light switches work really fast and accurate and work with our Google setup. So far, I am pretty pleased with the quality and how affordable these are.\n34#Failed after 6 months. Purchase in March , functioned as advertised for almost exactly 6 months and now totally dead.\n35#Easy to connect. Really easy to connect to phone and works really well\n36#So much needed. We are remodeling our house and we’ve been changing out our light switches for these modern switches. My husband installed it and they look fabulous. It’s so helpful not to have to get up to turn off the light. I absolutely love it and it’s worth every penny.\n37#Great for advanced smart home users! As I have been digging deeper into the smart home rabbit hole, this smart switch has been perfect to replace my regular switches on Smart light bulbs. It is annoying when you install a smart lightbulb on a regular switch and then accidentally turn the lights switch off. Then that defeats the entire purpose of the smart bulb and you have to manually turn the switch on for it to work again. Installation is really easy and the instructions provided were great. I definitely recommend these smart switches to bring your smart home to the next level.\n38#Stopped working after 7 months. I bought two of these after a kitchen remodel. I loved the look of them but after 6 months both switches barely work. I will have to replace them with a different style. The on/off is very erratic now. Sometimes it take a10-15 try’s just to turn one light on or off. Not sure if there is a warranty if any sort.\n39#Excellent smart switch. Excellent and quality snart switch. Easy to add to my smart home.\n40#It doesn't last. After about 6 months all three I purchased no longer function properly when physically pressed. I have to hold the button for 3-4 seconds for it to work, and even then it delays for another 3-4 seconds. I think it's a physical issue because they are still 100% reliable via automation. TLDR: Physical buttons wear out; smart home automation works great.\n41#This is not certified for US. Others have commented on the limited 10 Amp capacity of the switch and its acceptance of only small gauge wire. It is not UL approved. It is CE approved which means it is appropriate for European use not US use. With the migration to LED lighting a switch from 15 amp to 10 amp lighting circuits may be coming soon. But don't use this in a non lighting situation. You need the advise of a licensed electrician. It is not safe for homeowners without training to use these devices.\n42#Doesn't last. I installed it in my bathroom to control the vanity light and fan. After 6 months, the buttons didn't seem to work often. Thought maybe it was caused by the damp environment... but the smart features still worked. Today ... the smart features stopped working. It's only been about 8 months and I need to replace it.\n43#Doesn’t last and doesn’t work as advertised. After installation the connection to Alexa worked for a day and then would not stay connected- so certainly doesn’t work as advertised there. Bought the switches in January and now 8 months later they won’t turn on unless you press them many times, and once on they won’t turn off unless you press a dozen times and finally get lucky. Don’t waste your money on these switches.\n44#Worked perfectly. Only one that worked well with wifi and Alexa without disconnecting\n45#Works with Alexa, easy to get working. After having to return another brand of 2 gang smart switches because they would not work correctly with Alexa... these work correctly. They were easy to install and add to the App. After adding the MOES skill to Alexa, the switch showed up. Alexa was able to control both switches. I don't care for the snap on cover plate so I use a normal screw on cover plate. I use the top switch to control the light and the bottom switch for the fan in my ceiling fans.\n46#Poor durability. This is a switch that was built so poorly, I am concerned about turning it on and off without breaking it. I just missed my return window by a few days. Otherwise I would’ve sent this part back and bought something else.\n47#Great product 95% of the time. These wee affordable and easy to setup and use manually and in the app. I have one issue and one problem with them so far. Firstly they only work on 2.4GHz which isn’t a problem for me since my home network is dual band. But I can see issues with range from access points and overall connectivity issues because of the 2.4ghz. Secondly is I’ve had one freeze up where it turned on the lights it is attached to and refused to respond manually or through the app. I had to cut the power to it and then force it into pairing mode. Will definitely keep an eye out for similar issues with the others\n48#Not satisfied with the product. The switch loses connection with WiFi and the click becomes imprecise after some time of use.",
