These are too big. The one I was trying to replace is three times smaller and does the same.\n1#Arrival in good. They arrived in good condition just as viewed\n2#Better than another one I tried. Differ to other brands, this one allows to adjust the dimming range using a trimmer potentiometer on the PCB. It’s simple but would not recommend doing it unless you have some electrician’s experience. The unit makes very slight buzz in the mid dimming range. It can be fixed by adding some spacers over the inductor. Still, I would not recommend doing it unless you are an electronics pro. Assembly is fairly simple. My conclusion is that the dimmer is pretty decent.\n3#Diagram Not Completely Correct. The wiring diagram shows the location of the on/off/dimmer switch on the WRONG end. I didn't pick up on this until I had completed the first connection. I noticed the word LOAD was on the circuit board. Decided that had to be true. Swapped the wiring around and it works fine. It seems SO FUNDAMENTAL to get the diagram right. Obviously no one at the company is paying attention. The quality of the switch itself seem very good. I would purchase again if I needed.\n4#Nice! Great product…allows even, non-flickering dimming of even LED lamps. And well constructed\n5#Not what I thought it would. I thought this had prongs that push right into the electrical cord, but it doesn’t you have to strip the wires so I am not using it and I tried to send it back, but I can’t find one of them because I bought it in a set of two\n6#Great product! Easy to install and great performance. Thanks!\n7#Works well to dim a regular led light bulb. I use this to dim a standard 60w equivalent led bulb. Works fantastic. Took only moments to install.\n8#It's not a remote control. I thought it was a two unit remote control. One unit for the power, and another unit like a remote TV control, but I was wrong, my mistake. These are simply in line units kind of like a thumb wheel on-off switch for a lamp but adjustable for the brightness.\n9#Miserable experience. Wrong instructions AND wrong screws! Online instruction did NOT MATCH PRODUCT and sent with wood screws instead of machine screws. Just at a when plugged in. DONT BUY\n10#Works great, easy to install. I was looking for an inline dimmer for a couple of lamps. This was just what I needed. It was a simple process to install, you only need wire cutters, wire strippers and a small Phillips head screwdriver. Directions are simple to follow. I’m a DIY’er so it took me about 10 minutes start to finish to install one. if you are using this with an LED bulb it must be the type that is dimmable (it will say “dimmable” on the box and on the base of the bulb). This is truly a variable dimmer from full Off to full on.\n11#Amazing mod for bed side lamps. Larger than expected. Make sure you have wire strippers for installation\n12#Can’t beat the price. For the price, these do the job. For my application ( 6 arm chandelier) I probably should have splurged on one with a wider range of dimming power but once I buy different bulbs, this dimmer should be just fine. My LEDs are a bit too bright to look at.\n13#Gauge of wire not mentioned in description. Had to return to this my lamp had a larger gauge wire. Nowhere in the description does it mention size of wiring limitations .\n14#Works as a switch. I just installed this switch to a 25W LED light which I plan on using it for work light. I can’t speak for all but certainly mine failed to be a dimmable switch as it was described. It turned on when the rotary knob was in fully on position otherwise rapid blinking from 2/3 position. I read the instruction provided by the manufacturer prior to the installation . I didn’t hope too much but couldn’t stop myself from being disappointed.",
