This double 3-way switch is perfect for substituting a double gang box and two separate 3-way switches. However, you must hire a licensed electrician to install it for you, if you don’t understand wire schematics or basic wiring.\n1#I would avoid this item if you have any alternative. To the point, this product is a space saver. Let's you reduce two 3 way switches, in a 2 gang, down to a 1 gang box. As you are dealing with potentially (9) 12 gauge conductors in a 1 gang box, it stands to reason that there will be tension pushing the switch into place for final fitment. The retaining bracket is riveted once in the rear center, but the top and bottom bindings use a weird plastic retaining clip. As you draw this switch back into final position and compress those conductors, the plate tends to bend and the back rivet and the top and bottom clips retaining the housing pop out of place. Outward no less. In other words, instead of clamping the switch in place, tightening pops the entire switch housing outward, loosening the plastic portion of the switch from the bracket. I was able to use a c-clamp to pinch the top and bottom of the retaining bracket closer to the plastic housing (perhaps a 16th or so) ultimately allowing me to get it set right, but for a premium brand @ a premium price, this was remarkably poorly designed. In my particular install, I had the forethought to use a deep junction box. For a standard box, I do not think proper installation in its intended application would even be possible. If you have any other alternative, i would definitely avoid this product. Best of luck.\n2#It works. I was wiring in cabinet lighting for a unique cabinet and this switch allowed me to split the lighting levels for the shelves and opeated from 2 different locations on the custom built cabinet.\n3#Just what I needed. I was putting in a timer so I needed the extra space.\n4#its simple to install. you turn the switch one way it goes off and the other way turns on its like magic wow amazing for for real this thing works grate it feels better then most do in the switching\n5#Works perfectly. I replaced an old double switch in an apartment I am remodeling. The switch works perfectly.\n6#Good product!!! Couldnt find a double 3 way switch anywhere and its just what I wanted !!\n7#Great purchase that I couldn't find anywhere else. This is not a common item, I came to find out - I couldn't find them at Lowes, Home Depot or Ace Hardware so I ordered them here. I ended up having an electrician friend of mine install them because it was above my electrical knowledge, but he got them installed and they are working great.\n8#Exactly what we needed. Easy to install and exactly what we needed. I’m glad Amazon had this switch because our local hardware store did not carry it.\n9#Nice switch. Sturdy switch fast delivery and right price don’t waste your time looking at a box store for this switch cause they don’t carry it, few day delivery. This switch came in one day after I went to three different box stores. HD Lowe’s and Menards\n10#Works as intended. I had a situation where there were two separate legs that could possibly be out-of-phase from each other (battery backup). I needed to use one for lights in one place and one for lights in another. Breaking the tab actually splits this into two separate 2-way switches in the same box. Works as intended.\n11#Can't find these in the store. Just what I was looking for.\n12#Needed to buy a quality stack three-way switch. Leviton is a top quality product\n13#Easy to install. I will buy it again\n14#Excellent quality. I couldn’t find this double 3 way switch in the big box stores. Excellent quality. Works perfectly. I’d buy it again if needed. I’ve always had good luck with Leviton quality\n15#Combined hot leads. If you have 2 separate hot lead circuits, make sure you break out the connecting tab on the hot side. If you do not, your separate circuits will become 1.\n16#WORKS GREAT. JUST WHAT I NEEDED WORKS GREAT.\n17#Three way switch. It’s hard to get those tree way switches but Amazon had it and it works fine\n18#Fit and works just right. Fit and works just right\n19#3-way combo switch x 2. My parents house was built in the late 1970s and they have a hanging light above a landing in a raised ranch house. This switch is what is on that landing next to the porch light switch. It controls the hanging light, and a downstairs hallway light. Each light I mentioned is also controlled by at least 1 other switch (downstairs hallway is controlled by 2). I searched everywhere for a double 3-way switch, and Amazon was the only place that had this. Instructions are kinda hard to understand, but not impossible. There is a metal tab that's on the switch by default that needs to be broken off to separate the switches. I used the old switch as a reference to wiring up the new one.\n20#Amazing! Working on my house, I realized I needed a very specific half switch setup - dual 3-way switches for 2 different circuits. I didn't even know half switches existed until I started looking around, and when I needed 3-way versions, I found this singular option. I'm sure there are others as well, but Leviton makes decent switches and figured this was my way to finish my project. Wired up nicely, switches feel solid, and got everything into the small box as needed. Glad this exists!\n21#Looks great- read the instructions on the website. Dislike: instructions were not in or on the box and there wasn’t a website to direct you to where instructions could be found. I did find them and it did answer the question I had. Likes: crisp click when turning the switch on and off. Using the existing wiring there was a question regarding the tab connecting the two switches and the configuration from the old switch that I needed to read through the instructions on the manufacturers website. This certainly helps complete the remodel of our 1970’s built home with new, bright white, matching switches throughout.\n22#Exactly what I needed. I purchased this set of switches to replace a broken one in my home. This one fit perfectly. The wiring connections were slightly different than on my old one, but we figured it out and everything works great.\n23#Works as expected. I never could find one of these in my local hardware store so bought it through amazon. Allows me to control two separate gangs of lights with two separate switches in the space normally associated with one switch. Easily installed though I had to be careful working with a lot of wires in a tight space inside the box since I also had three rocker type switches next to it.\n24#Installation note. Be sure to break off the tab on the 2 wire side to have each side of the switch independent.\n25#Perfect replacement. Got an old house with this type of switch? It’s a perfect replacement and it’s well made.\n26#They work. Works great, the switches feel a little hard, cheap when switching on and off. But, overall a good deal\n27#Does the job, but cover comes off easily (and Don't forget to break the tab is separate power). As noted in other reviews, the plastic cover can separate fairly easily. Otherwise works as it should. Also, there is a metal tab that has to be broken off if powering the 2 circuits separately. Took so digging to realize what was going on.\n28#Cheap. Feels cheap, the switch edges are square and sharp\n29#Space savers. These switches were exactly what we needed to save space on the wall. Unfortunately we ended up not needing them so they were returned\n30#No need for additional work to replace box. 3 way/3 way worked like a charm. No need for a bigger box for another switch.\n31#Good bargain. Work as intended\n32#Just what I needed. Couldn't find this style in a white color at any home appliance store so I tried Amazon. Exactly what I needed and it is nice quality. Thanks!\n33#Does what it should. It's a light switch. Not much I can say other than it works and it feels like it is solidly made, not flimsy like the one found in my new construction home that had to be replaced after 4 years.\n34#3 way switch. Works as expected. Good instructions included\n35#Good quality. Installed three way light in kitchen.\n36#Switch. Great product for a fair price\n37#Worked great and less expensive than the hardware store. Three different switches in our 40 year old house finally dies - all in the same week. I bought replacements from Amazon because the exact same switch was a lot more at our local hardware store. They installed easily and work great. Hooray - we can turn the lights on and off again. ;)\n38#Should be sold in “Big Box Stores”. Excellent, works perfect\n39#Worked great. Worked great\n40#ON/OFF. ON position for top switch is to the right and ON position for lower switch in to the left. I have never seen this before\n41#Product doesn’t match picture! This is not the product shown. I purchased this because of the low profile corners only for it to not match the image, I will be returning.\n42#Delivered Exactly as Described. From packaging to delivery - the order went perfectly. There were no problems. Thank you.\n43#It was perfect. Was at just what I ordered to replace a light switch in my kitchen I couldn’t find it locally\n44#Great dual three-way switch. Easy installation. Switching is crisp, and I like the little bit of softness at either end of the switching motion. Makes it feel like I'm not going to accidentally break it by flipping it too hard.",
