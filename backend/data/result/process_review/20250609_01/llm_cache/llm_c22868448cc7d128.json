Ge makes good.stuff in my opinion. These switches work great as expected\n1#Perfect replacement for my cracked switches. Had to replace cracked switches and these were a perfect fit. I just needed to make sure I had them lined up in face plate some my OCD would be in check :)\n2#Needed to replace my switches. They works really work color.match my.wall and fit perfect with out any issue.\n3#It Works. Ease installation, perfect size, color and quality\n4#Great value for its money very easy to install. I was replacing switches with smart switches but there are areas where I was using regular switches so that they are matched I replaced the old fashioned switch with these nice rectangular toggle switches, they look very nice and professional very easy to install a highly recommend it\n5#Quaility Switch. Well made switch, very positive clicks, easy to install, work well.\n6#Excelente. Excelente en calidad precio\n7#Received GE UltraPro. They are perfect. + Do not have branding on the front of the switch; just a clean appearance. + They are very white, which is great for a refresh to have everything look new! + Nice click; do not just rock, but reside in either the on or off position + Wire install is a snap. (Use a tester to ensure power is off.) + Nice Price All-around great buy and will be ordering more!\n8#Good quality. Better than most brand, good price.\n9#Broke in 6 months. 3 of the 4 broke in less than 6 months. Waste of time and money\n10#Recommended. Great Product\n11#Sturdy. I recently had to replace most of my light switches since they kept breaking. No issues since switching to these GE light switches.\n12#✅. Good, I love ❤️\n13#GE? Had the switch installed for about a year. It failed and I have never in my life ever seen a switch fail. I’m not an electrician I’m just a homeowner in all the houses I ever lived in I never encountered a switch fail like this.\n14#Not What I Expected ... But They Work Well! No wiring included. They're not quiet ... They make quite a loud click! But they're good quality and easy to install if you know what you're doing! Thank You!\n15#Easy to install and nice strong click. I love them. They were worth every penny and after fighting with large smart switches these were a dream to work with and fit into the box. I would highly recommend these.\n16#Needed to replace 2 out of 5 so far. Good reviews and low price from a well known brand, GE, but the old adage \"you get what you pay for\" is true. I have had to replace two out of the five switches, so far. The paddle rocker switch part comes loose and eventually comes off. These are just plastic molded with side clips that apparently give way and no longer hold in place. My youngest son no doubt messed with them and made them worse but never should have come free like they did to allow him to pull one whole paddle free. Not clear if there's a risk of shock with the cover paddle removed but the contact switch is metal under the plastic housing. I will be inspecting the rest and replacing as needed. I do not recommend this product.\n17#Broke within a week. Broke within a week of use. Really disappointing that the product is so poorly constructed.\n18#Easy to install but loud. Super easy to install. Was looking to update my original flick up and down switch. These work really well. Got a 5 pack of the single pole. They worked. My only complaint is that they are loud. See video demonstrating their volume.\n19#Good product. Works as described\n20#New Switches in Old Home. I ordered several of these to upgrade switches in my 1940 home. I have been installing new floors and repainting. It made sense to also replace/upgrade all the outlets, covers, switches and plates. I appreciated being able to order many of them here.\n21#Great power handling switches.... These appear to be great light switches, they are being used in the new construction of a tiny house. I'll update my review when they are installed and in use.\n22#not recommend. arrived with finger print on it and really dirty.\n23#Have light in my kitchen window! This replaced an old wall switch and works perfectly. We just have to find a cover to fit back on the wall.\n24#Don’t Get Screwed! Buy From Somewhere Else! I Totally Got Taken On These Switches, Ordered Them But Only Received 1 Switch!!! It Clearly Shows a 5 Pack NOT 1 Single Switch!!!! Look At the Picture I Included So You Can See For Yourself!!!! Absolutely Ridiculous!!!! Very Aggravating To Say The Least! Buy From Someone Else!!!\n25#Perfect for any home that isn’t a mansion. Overall they’re good switches. The only gripes I have is that they arrived with some crud on them that I was unable to clean off, and the glossy finish was already worn away on some spots. They work, they installed easily, and they’re solid. Can you get higher quality rocker switches? Sure. If you’re considering these you most likely don’t live in a mansion so they will certainly suit your needs.\n26#consistently great. I've installed 15 of these now. and every one of them worked perfectly - great quality control at GE\n27#Cheap poor quality. poor quality switches fall apart with minimal use. will not purchase again.\n28#GARBAGE, RUN! GARBAGE. These are trash. 2 have already come apart, with two small kids in the house this is a lawsuit waiting to happen. 2 others are already loose. Only have been in use for 3 months, wow. Run away, these are junk!\n29#Look great, very easy to install. This was my first time dealing with anything electric - I moved into a new apartment that had yellow light switches and it was driving me crazy. Decided to tackle it on my own. this was super easy to install and i finally no longer have yellow eyesores in the middle of my white walls.\n30#good for single light switch. If you need a three way,this is not the product for you. Otherwise,all went well.\n31#Exactly as described. Exactly as described\n32#Standard Replacements. These are standard replacements and dont have much work to do if you are swapping out. It not real sturdy but good enough to keep up with.\n33#Get it. Good deal And easy to install\n34#Very cheap and poorly made. I don't usually like to write negative reviews but 3 out of 5 of these switches have completely broken within one month of installation. The rocker itself came apart and is unable to be fixed. JUNK.\n35#Well made. Works as described. Well made\n36#not quite as i thought i was buying. Not quite as i thought i was buying, LOUD click when turning off/on but very good over all\n37#Exactly what I needed. Perfect!! Great fit and easy to put in\n38#Quality switch. Quality switch does what it's supposed to.\n39#These are okay switches.. They used to make these \"decora\" switches so much better. Years ago they were much sturdier and durable. No one seems to make the higher-quality ones anymore. I took a gamble on these because of the reviews and they seem okay, but they're just more of the same plastic. GE, please bring the quality back to your light switches!\n40#No worries! Good switches good price. I am an electrician so these switches are a real bargain and it works as advertised. Simple switches no worries.\n41#Simple install. Simple install in my residential setting\n42#Perfect. Great price, great product.\n43#Good quality switches, but the white color doesn't match the more modern white. Great switches, seem to be well built. They are not the quiet type, you can hear the click which I like. White color is different from screwless white plates and the newer model switches, like the smart, sensor and dimmer switches. So it is a bit of a mismatch.\n44#Updated an apartment. Switched out the old painted small switches with these toggle switches and gave the apartment an immediate facelift / update.\n45#Great product! So ideal for an easy upgrade to our home. Love it!\n46#Works perfectly exactly as I expected it to. Works perfectly exactly as I expected it to. You will not be disappointed if you are looking for a good quality switch\n47#Works good. Easy to install and works good also with LED light. Just little to load click on turns switch to ON/OFF",
