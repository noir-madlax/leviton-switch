It works as advertised. But I bought a bunch of these. And one of them could not be used because one of the clamps used for connecting the wires would not open to accept the wire. Although you can connect the wire the old-fashioned way by connecting it to the screw, in this case that could not be done because it was the grounding connection, which sits at the very top and would get in the way of the gang box screw. So, I had to toss that one - ARGH!\n1#Great switch. Great addition to the home automation setup. works great with HomeAssistant\n2#Can with stripped screw. The screw on the neutral wire was stripped when I got it. No way to connect it\n3#Great instructions. All the Zooz switches I’ve used have been great. Really clear instructions for standard, 3 way, 4 way and even more unusual setups. Easy to pair. Have had many for several years with no issues. I use with a Hubitat hub.\n4#Works very well, even for smart blinds! I have Z-Wave smart blinds made by Bali with a remote that came with the blinds. I was looking for a way to control the blinds via a wall switch to add a professional touch to my room. I learned that you can directly associate Z-Wave devices to each other, and I purchased this switch, hoping I could pair them together. It works perfectly! I directly associating the switch to the blinds in Home Assistant using the \"On/Off Control\" and \"Remote Dimming\" groups. Now the blinds will open when I press the up bottom and close when I press the down button. Furthermore, if I hold the up or down button, the blinds will go up/down until I release. This is exactly what I was looking for! The best part is if I ever move from my house, the direct association will continue working without my Home Assistant hub set up. For some reason, I couldn't find anyone else who had this set up when I searched Google, but it worked perfectly.\n5#Failed After Nine Months. I've had Z-Wave switches fail but they lasted at least 4-5 years. I installed in February. It's only November and it's dead. I'm going to avoid this brand in the future.\n6#Reliable and durable. I am in the long process of changing my smart home from insteon devices to Z-Wave-based devices. Several months ago I decided to purchase Zooz devices. They are reasonably priced. They seem to be very durable. And their configuration options allow for complete customization. They dim from 99% all the way down to 1% with a compatible light fixture. Using Home Assistant software, they even support direct association which allows for true 3 way functions without the need for rewiring. Great for remodeling. So far I have replaced 49 insteon devices with Zooz units, and I couldn't be happier. Not a single dud, easy setup, and after 2 years not a single failure. I have 28 more devices to do and I am confident they will be Zooz devices. As always, if you need it, get it. You won't be disappointed.\n7#Poor dimming-down performance. I bought this dimmer direct. I have several Zooz 800 series switches and really like them, so I thought I might as well replace one of my Leviton zwave dimmers with a newer one that supports S2. Unfortunately, it's been a bit of a let down for 2 reasons. While dimming (any level but full brightness), it emits an audible buzzing noise that I can hear several feet away. But what's worse is when dimming to a lower level it feels very choppy. Dimming up works much better, but down is almost like a flicker. On the other hand, the Leviton dimmer it replaced dimmed these very same LED can lights smooth like butter, with zero flicker or choppiness. Indistinguishable from incandescent. It almost feels like the microcontroller is underpowered and can't process the brightness steps fast enough. Really weird. Sadly I will put the old dimmer back and use this in a less used place.\n8#Excellent. It’s an awesome Z-Wave dimmer, what’s not to love?\n9#800 Series Severe Reliability Issues. I have had dozens of Zooz switches in my home for years, and they have worked great and were great value for money, but recently I have had to start replacing individual switches that have started to malfunction after several years of service. The new 800 series switches I have been getting as replacements have been an unmitigated disaster. 4 of the last 6 I have purchased have been defective. Not sure if this is the product of deliberate cost cutting by Zooz, or a terrible supplier deal, but I will (with some sadness) be switching to another brand.\n10#Watch for re-packaged product. I'll give the product five stars, but the packaging two stars. I say that because the product was apparently a return, as evidenced by the fact that the PIN code listed on the box itself was different from the PIN code on the device, and there were no installation instructions. Fortunately, I noticed the discrepancy with the PIN code and any instructions needed were available on the web. The device itself still had the protective film on the switch paddle and so far is performing perfectly.\n11#Works great, using HomeAssistant. Works great, no issues getting it setup, very responsive. The only issue I came across, which I do not believe is the fault of this switch, is I get flickering at 100% with my bulbs (they are dimmable). In searching reviews for \"flicker\" the only results are from people specifically mentioning no flicker. So I'm assuming it's the bulbs. In any case, I set the maximum brightness to 85% (I picked that number arbitrarily as it's still plenty bright, higher is probably fine), and the double-tap upper paddle behavior to \"Configured maximum brightness\" and that works fine.\n12#Great alternative to Inovelli. I got this because the Inovelli blue batch I received from the first one was a dud and I wanted to try the z-wave protocol. Setup was easy for me and I have zwave set up on my server with a dongle. My system picked it up right away. This switch was rock solid (more than Inovelli) and didn't have the same issues with dimming. I wish I had started with these instead but most of my home is zigbee so I went that route.\n13#It works, mostly. It's not amazing. I bought this one and another slightly more expensive Leviton one a few days ago to compare. These Zooz ones do work but two major issues with my set up. I'm using it for overhead recessed lighting retrofit LED replacement. The brand is one I got at Lowe's called Utilitech. Firstly the Zooz one is noticeably slower, with delayed responsiveness compared to the Leviton switch. I am using Smartthings and Googe Home. Second issue is the dimming precentages. The lights can be dimmed lower, all the way down to 5% with the Leviton. With the Zooz switch, the brightness being dimmed to 40% is almost imperceptible. 50% eith Zooz is comparable to Levitons 5%. This might not be a big issue as you just have to adjust what your scale is for what you tell Google assistant to dim the lights to or through your phone's app, however I still have GE Zwave Dimmers too and they operate at similar dimming settings as the Levitons. So it's hard remembering to set the kitchen to one dimmed level and the living room to a completely different one. Also since the GE and Leviton match, kinda makes me think it'd a Zooz issue. Could just be with my specific lights, but just putting it out there. As a bonus negative, the QR code that said SmartThings didn't work to set it up. I was able to get an unsecured setup. And that could also be why it has those issues as it states if you don't complete a secure set up, you may have issues. But the set up of the leviton was also easier and worked immediately.\n14#Bad quality Dimmer switch and On-Off Switches. Apparently I am unable to review the On-Off switches as the link takes me to the Dimmer Switch. Therefore I'm reviewing both here. This dimmer switch flickers every few seconds when lights are dimmed even the slightest bit. The On-Off Switches: 2 out of 4 switches wouldn't tighten down the wire, 1 switch would not connect to Z-Wave Smartthings hub.\n15#Requires firmware flash right out of the box. Yea. Refused to work with Homeseer 4. Found I needed to update Homeseer. That wasn't it, found that you can update Zwave module/plug-in inside of Homeseer. Now Homeseer will flash devices with \".gbl\" files. Updated firmware on device. Deleted node, factory reset on Zooz, rebooted Homeseer, re-paired Zooz. And after about five minutes it had built up all the sub-devices and it worked. Took over two hours to install a light switch. If this sounds like fun, then go for it. What Zooz needs to do is: Not ship defective devices that require a firmware update just to function. Not to mention updating my smart home hub to accommodate a single devices fancy new firmware format. Furthermore, Zooz wants you to submit to \"registering\" your product before you can get their firmware. That's insane. They shipped a defective non-working light switch and I have to go through some data-harvesting process and hopefully get vetted so they will send me the firmware that they should have installed before selling the thing. Then I get the pleasure of doing the job that I paid them to do in the first place when I purchased it (install functioning firmware). Sorry if that sound privileged or something, but I did pay $45 for a light switch.\n16#Works great, extremely customizable! Great ZWave dimmer. Easy to pair. Extremely customizable. You can change the LED color and brightness, dim on/off time, a bunch of other stuff. You can also do scene control with this. I was using the Leviton dimmers before this, and may switch given they are slightly less expensive and much more customizable.\n17#Excellent quality and works as advertised! Easy to install and very good instructions! Quality is good and it works just as advertised.\n18#Malfunctioning devices, unable reach support, asked by Zooz to switch brand. I spent $1000 on ZooZ devices in 2021, and are facing major issues right now, with devices disconnecting on a random basis. I also have several devices that may require warranty replacement. Back in 2021 the support was great. Now I send emails and do not get a response. I am completely ignored. Phone calls immediately go to voicemail and I never get a call back. I used a different email account and got the answer along the line of \"well, if you have problems with our devices, you should change the brand\", not even working on diagnosing the root cause. I opened tickets and they are automatically closed within minutes or just being deleted. There is no way to find out, if the devices are registered, since there is no response. I wanted to get some troubleshooting going and never get any response. There is also no ability to find their physical address and a different way of contacting beyond their info account. I am really disappointed with the deterioration of their service and them ignoring me. Update 3/24/23: The company is not only ignoring me... they blocked me from their Facebook page after a negative but constructive review. I do not believe I did something wrong, except for buying their products\n19#Reasonably priced, up to date Z-Wave dimmer. I typically use Jasco but decided to try this for one of my 4-way applications with dumb switches. In the end, I used it for a single pole dimmer in my office. It's working well enough, and has lots of additional features that I probably won't mess with. I configured it with my Smart Things hub using the Zooz edge driver, and then exposed to Homekit via Homebridge+ST plug-in. The edge driver has an astounding number of parameters that you can play with, if so inclined, and a fair number of Controls exposed in the ST app. Since the Zooz and Jasco are close in price, I might use this again in the future.\n20#Poor quality. Great if you want a product that you'll have to replace every year. I purchased nine Zooz dimmer switches. Installed according to manual. No problems initially. I was shorted one switch initially but customer service did send a replacement. I want to like these. They are easy to program with our Smart Things hub. I've got two that are installed outdoors in protected housings which have held up fine in cold weather. There is an \"air gap\" plug under the paddle. I've had multiple switches spontaneously fail when this air gap popped out. It can't be reinserted. Zooz (The Smartest House) couldn't explain to me why this happened. Initially this occurred under warranty. They sent replacements. I reinstalled. Had my electrician check that these circuits were wired and acting appropriately (wiring in the house in only 4 years old and I haven't had any other issues). Now I've had several more fail. Out of warranty. Out of luck. Zooz won't back up their products or offer any explanation as to why this happened. The circuits they control are not overloaded. I've wired well over 200 switches and receptacles over the years in homes that we've owned and have never had a switch fail. So buyer beware. Lots of great reviews that I imagine are written after initial install. I typically don't write negative reviews but this product certainly earned it.\n21#Works with Hubitat. Paired nicely with Hubitat!\n22#Fifth Purchase, still going strong. If you have a ZWave network, this is absolutely the best and cost-effective choice on Amazon. Things I like about this switch. 1. Network add is a walk in the park. No fuss with HASIO 2. No add-on switch necessary! Saves you $20-30 each time! 3. READ THE DOCUMENT. Take your time and read each line before you install. Its a great piece of documentation/instruction. 4. Great support. They respond in a timely fashion when you are stuck somewhere 5. Reliable. I have a few of these from 2021 and they are still working fine - unlike others! Finally, value for money.\n23#Perfect Z-Wave Switch, Works Well in 3-Way Configuration and Only 1 of These are Needed! This is the perfect Z-Wave switch, I have it in a 3-way configuration where I use one of these switches and a normal dumb switch and it works flawlessly. Its also easy enough to use with Home Assistant (HA). Once you have Z-Wave JS installed its easy to pair this. Once paired you simply listen to zwave_js_value_notification events in the develop tab. This will give you the device ID, label and value so you can set up your automations for it.\n24#These do not work with most dimmable LED bulbs. The Zen72 is a leading edge dimmer and most bulbs need a trailing edge dimmer. Buy the Zen77 instead if you need a smart dimmer switch.\n25#Horrible as ZWave Devices. The dimmer itself works but when connected to home automation through zwave, the device is flakey. If you use the paddle to turn the light on full, it improperly reports as OFF so if automation trys to turn it off, nothing happens. It also takes over 7 hours to do a firmware update. Even with the firmware updated it still did not function properly. I bought three of them, they all exhibited the same behavior.\n26#Works well, flexible. A good quality switch, seems very flexible. Product info could be better as its hard to tell difference between some of these zen series products. Still not sure whether I should have bought this model or the one higher up\n27#Works like a charm. Quick installation, this was not as bulky as some Z-Wave switches I've used. I like the tap-vs-long-tap brightness adjustment. Integrated quickly into my smart home system.\n28#Works great, 14 led pot lights, no hum, smartthings. Cheaper than ge, honeywell. I assume the supply chain issues, semiconductor shortage drove up z wave prices. This was relatively priced well. I have 14 pot lights in basement. Led, like less than 10 watts each. This works with smartthings. Now I don't need to get my butt off sofa. Only complaint... as I was installing it, turning breaker back on, pots were live but in the lowest dim level... to me they looked off. So I assumed wiring was wrong... wasted like 30 min playing with wires only to realize it was working at the beginning. Held up for a few seconds, and boom, lights were working. Odd.\n29#open the electrical box before ordering. I gave 4 stars because although I think the product is of quality (and it is regarded a such in the HA community) , I could not install it as my wiring is not compatible with it. rule of thumb for this product: ->If the power comes to the switch box before getting to the fixture, then install this switch. ->if the power comes to the fixture and is then sent to 2 3-way switches, then this product *will not fit*. This switch *requires 4 wires at the box*, which was not my case. So I had to return it (thanks for easy returns!) and order an other product that should support 3 wires switch boxes. My appreciation is that the description is not clear enough (hence 4 stars), and unless you open your boxes and compare with the well redacted documentation before ordering, you might end up with a non compatible product. So buyers beware!\n30#Works perfect. Bought a few of these switches to automate my home with SmartThings and they work like a charm. They take no time to pair and control. Excellent to use in conjunction with the Zooz keypads for more home automation. Will definitely use these more with future projects with clients.\n31#Great customer service. My houses wiring was atypical and did not match any diagrams on their website, I emailed Zooz and they made me a custom wiring diagram that worked perfectly. Fantastic customer service and a great product",
