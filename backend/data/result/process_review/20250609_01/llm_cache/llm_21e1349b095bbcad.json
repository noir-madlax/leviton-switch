Easy to install. works as intended\n1#It works. I replaced a 210S with this and it’s working fine.\n2#I wish it lasted longer. These work great but wear out after a few years. Still in my opinion the best looking switch of this type. I wish the plastic switch were available on its own but the closest I can find costs almost as much as the whole kit.\n3#Well made item. Switch worked well\n4#Failed in less than 2 years. Was hoping for longevity but…stopped functioning just short of 2 years. Only 2 people in the house. Was hoping for st least 5 years or more like my original. Will seek a sturdier model if that exists.\n5#Perfect Interaction. The part was perfect and it actually showed up a day early. I would definitely order from them again.\n6#Not built for the long run. Product was slightly difficult to install. It lasted almost 2 years to the day. I purchased this for my daughter‘s pantry December 20 22. Fast-forward December 2024 interior guts of the switch broke I purchased a new similar switch made with more metal than this plastic one hoping for better results\n7#Wore out in less than 1 year. We use this on our basement door which gets regular use, but it shouldn't have pooped out so quickly imo That said, it performed flawlessly until one day it stayed on.\n8#Works. God replacement part, works as expected\n9#Quality. Great Product\n10#Pricey but good. Fits great as a replacement for same product so that you don't have to do any modifications.\n11#Very good product. Works like it should. It was an almost exact replacement for a switch that was 45 years old. Happy with the performance.\n12#Worked great for a while. Until.. Purchase and installed in Nov. 2022, has worked great since installed but about a week ago, July 2024, the switch is stuck on. Out of warranty so forced to purchase another one\n13#Product worked as advertised. The product worked as advertised and was delivered promptly\n14#As promised. Good product exactly what i was looking for\n15#These don't last. I'm switching to a different brand of switch since 2016 I've had these go bad 5 times. I just bought a new one that was deaf out of the box. I'm curious what the cycle rating is on these.\n16#Nice item. Works week can be a pain to align, but it is a great switch\n17#Closet door light switch. Basically a direct replacement switch. So far it has lasted over two months. We will see. I think it is a bit overpriced from the second unit I bought from the local electrical supply store, not Lowe’s or Home Depot.\n18#Closest door light switch. Perfect replacement switch for my pantry Closet door. First one lasted 5 years. When door is closed the light is off. When the door opens the light switch activates and we can see with an overhead light.\n19#Perfect. Perfect replacement for our previous switch that had worn out. Love the gold detail! Quick install\n20#Door switch. Bought two. Works great highly recommend\n21#Perfect Replacement! Perfect replacement fit for the original installed in my house that failed.\n22#Perfect Fit. Easy to install and my light now works again in the pantry when I open the door - thank you!\n23#Easy replacement. It was an easy replacement for the original one installed by my builder. Original one lasted 6 years\n24#May want to buy two - they only last 2-3 years. These are not very durable.\n25#Great closet upgrade. The switch works great. They should make the switch white. Most doors are and frames are white so this should be a standard. The install was straight forward. I was redoing my closet and had to take the moulding off of the inside of closet. Cut open the frame area for the box. Make sure you use 14/2 wire if not you’ll have an issue getting the wire in the box. Over all it’s a great upgrade\n26#Fit. Easy install pretty cheapl material don’t know how long it will last\n27#NO INSTRUCTIONS! PRODUCT CAME WITH NO WIRING INSTRUCTIONS AS TO HOW TO WIRE IT TO POWER..\n28#Almost perfect fit on an existing antique switch. The length of this replacement was about one eighth of an inch too long. A slight tap with a sharp chisel fixed the jamb opening. Two wire nuts later and it was working perfectly.\n29#Great replacement. This was a perfect replacement for my original switch that I installed about 9 years ago. With everyone going in and out of our pantry as often as they do, this is probably the most-used light switch in the house, and the fact that it lasted 9 years before it went out is a testament to its durability and longevity. The button failed on my last unit and I'm hoping to get another 9-10 years out of this one.\n30#Works well, installed few weeks ago, brass door plate 5stars and hoping long durability. Just instal a few weeks ago so can't rate durability. trusting it last a very long time. Lee products are normally very reliable. The door is to a pantry. Very HAPPY with this switch. It works well and the measurements were good as it replaced a door switch and the cover plate measured 3.5\" long. I wish all products would list as this one did, the width, height and length when offering items. It is extremely important to have measurements when order these things. Seller was good to show 3.5 inch length. This Included an electrical box if one is doing a new install. The width worked out because of the comments form buyers were very good to post and show the door jams etc and write comments. The old door switch (to a large kitchen pantry) quit working after 40 years, go figure. LOL, and was hard wired. This product had enough lead wire and workable to hard wire with wire nuts (not included) and also to simply wrap a band of electrical tape (not included) around for second security. Tape may not be needed with wire nuts but added safety. The brass screws included, good length, fit the former holes. All in all, it is a great ending to a search for: \"where is a door switch to replace this 40+ year old switch. Great find and quality product! Would use this company again. NO brick and mortar electrical store or hardware store had anything like this. Thank you LEE ELECTRIC!\n31#If work for long time is good??? I installed and after a year and half is no work anymore, I gas I need to buy an other one.\n32#They don't last very long. I bought this to replace an identical one which failed in under a year. My brother also had one that failed in under a year. It's easy to replace, but the switch itself is cheaply made and just doesn't last. So far, I have not found a better alternative, so if you buy, just expect to replace at least once per year. I found a source for the internal plastic switch, which simply snaps into the assembly, but it consts as much as the whole assembly. The switches by themselves should sell for around $1 per each, but they do not. If I could source the switches separatly and cheaply, I would just keep some on hand so I would have new ones when they break.\n33#Works well. Easy to install. Wish it would have come with instructions but it’s pretty straight forward if you look it up online. Works well after installed.\n34#Perfect replacement, easy installation. Perfect dimensions to match defective switch. Went in easily and worked as designed.\n35#Lasted a little over a year. The product lasted a little over one year, which conveniently was right after the warranty ended. I contacted customer support and they said that they’d send me a replacement, which never happened. Pretty disappointed, but you can’t expect much more from a Chairman Mao special.\n36#doesn't last. as many others report, it doesn't hold up. I've gone through 2 in 3 years. time for something new.\n37#Did not last. I've installed two of these on a kitchen pantry door and both failed within a year. This time around, I spent more and installed the leviton. Hopefully it works longer.\n38#Be precise on your mortise cut. **make sure your width is as tight and precise as you can make it. The face plate is the same width as the gang box.** It would be nice if it was a 1/8th wider. I would go with another brand if that was the case and you want a better finish look. The brass finish has the look and texture if a brass spray paint. The gang box isn’t very rigid and can be easily deformed if forced in. It is made by folding a piece of metal over, origami style and none of the seams are connected.\n39#Easy to install. Works great.\n40#Worked great...until it didn't. I've had 2 of these and they seem to last me about 1-2 years. Mine is installed on the pantry door and with young children it does get a lot of use. If you are putting it somewhere low usage then it ight be perfect. I'm guessing mine are failing at 10k cycles which is pretty poor honestly.\n41#Failed after two years. Easy to install, but failed after two years\n42#Low force switch better than what I replaced. Very nice appearance and function. The force needed to activate these is very low, and there's a significant \"breakaway\" after activation so the force to keep them depressed is smaller still. I used these to replace some ancient switches that were so hard to press that the door couldn't hold them shut without a super strong latch. With these, I don't even need a latch, as the small amount of door friction can hold them in. Be sure you measure your existing switch to make sure these are an exact fit. If so, I think youll be very happy with these. I would NOT recommend these for new installations. As others have noted, installing these from scratch in old work is not simple.\n43#All the features above are very correct. Pantry Door\n44#Back of switch opened and spring stuck. in about two weeks of little use the switch stuck pulled switch and noted the back opened and hung up the spring.. Out of warranty..\n45#that it was easily available on Amazon. Everything you needed at a great value price\n46#Switch Failure. This is the 2nd switch failure for me. The first one lasted a couple years, the newest one lasted just a few months. I am going to look for another brand. It's on a pantry door that gets opened frequently but it does not hold up. It should be cycle rated at many thousands, not hundreds.\n47#Failed. Easy enough to install. Already had opening in door jamb. Stopped working after about 7 months.\n48#Very good replacement or even new install. Simple direct and easy.\n49#Solid build for switch. Switch is solidly built, not much plastic. Doesn’t feel cheaply made. Not easy to install once doors are already in, much better to do when originally installing door jambs. I have done both with this switch, using one after the door was installed, and had to cut out the jamb to fit the switch. The install with the new door frame was much easier, prepping the cuts before the door went in. Would buy again!",
