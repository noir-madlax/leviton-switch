Works great\n1#Good switch. Very good dimmer switch for any ceiling light.\n2#Dims Well. works well... replaced defaulty unit. These dimmers die after a few years, but thankfully they're easy to swap out.\n3#Great product! Installed them in my new kitchen and they work very well! Good quality.\n4#Pictures misleading. Don’t let the pictures fool you this comes with no faceplate. Easy to install but now a faceplate needs to be ordered separately\n5#Excellent Dimmer, Easy to Install. We needed a dimmer switch to control four overhead LED can lights. This one was easy to install and works perfectly. This is a reliable and quality brand, too!\n6#Quality. Easy peasy. Smooth\n7#Highest quality on the market. excellent, works great. Easy to install\n8#Keeps blowing. 1st one blew within a month, 2nd one blew recently and just replaced for the 3rd time\n9#Works great. Easy to install, works as described\n10#Smooth and easy adjustment. This control moves easily and dims the light without flickering. Easy to install. Good instructions included.\n11#5 minutes install and works great. Easy to install and works great! Got a quote for replacing the dimmet $70 and five minutes work done!\n12#Nice Quality Convenient Switch. Easy Install. Great Features.\n13#Ghost Controls. Replaced 2 dimmer switches (that were working fine) with these based on looks. Big mistake. Now neither work as well as they did before. One controls some strip lights over cooktop. Despite programming them over and over they will not allow full brightness or dimness and they slightly flicker on lowest setting. The other controls 2 LEDs above same cooktop and flicker while toggling and when at lowest setting they all of a sudden turn themselves back up to high all by themselves! Weird. I reprogrammed and checked the wiring to no avail. If it was just one of them then I would chalk it up to a fluke but it's BOTH of them. Replaced them with the original dimmers and now they work fine again. Can't recommend.\n14#Flickers, a lot. We bought one of these for a new bathroom remodel. Dimmed all the way works great, as well as full power. But anything in between flickers, bad. Not of and on like in some of the video reviews, but enough to make you want to replace the switch, which I plan on doing, asap.\n15#Good. Easy to install and works well id buy again if needed\n16#Easy Install, No LED Flicker, Smooth Dimming. I am a huge fan of Leviton products over cheaper knockoff brands. I bought this dimmer switch for the chandelier in our dining room. The chandelier has dimmable LED bulbs and this dimmer switch dims them smoothly and accurately without any flickering (had problems with cheaper brands). I also like the fact that it has a separate on/off switch from the dimmer itself. I can go from full brightness to barely visible light, so the range of dimming it outstanding. This switch works with both LED and incandescent bulbs and is great value for the money. I expect that it will last for years to come.\n17#Missing Parts and used. Item was used. Missing a screw to screw into the electrical box. Copper wires stripped and twisted already. Light switch showed signs of wear. Plastic packaging open as well.\n18#Flickering. Caused really bad flickering in my new dimmable led light. Would not recommend.\n19#Works great, easy to install. Super easy to install, just took a few minutes. Used with my LED Flat Panel Light Surface Mount lights.\n20#Very reliable and compatible. Excellent dimmer switch. Set this up with a intermatic 24 hour mechanical 24 hr timer, as a 3 way. Works great.\n21#Failed within weeks. Installed this switch to control 7 dimmable LED bulb can lights. It failed within 2 weeks. Replaced the switch like-for-like with another one. Failed within 2 weeks.\n22#Sold as new but clearly used and damaged. Package was cut open. Parts were missing (wire nuts). Worst of all, the ground wire was clipped and not useful. Clearly not new but was sold as new. total misrepresentation.\n23#Great dimmer switch. Works great. I replaced my old dimmer control which you adjusted by turning a knob with this. I like that you can set the brightness and turn it on or off separately. The old switch you had to turn it all the way to the left to turn it off and then turn it the other way to turn it on and then find the desired brightness every time. With this one, there is an on and off switch and a slider for the brightness. When you turn the light off, the next time you turn it on, it is set to the same brightness. I have an old house so the ground wire is attached to the metal box so it was a bit confusing trying to install the new switch. I’m not an electrician so I was worried that I was going to burn the house down. But I and my house are still here so I guess I installed it correctly.\n24#Easy to install but don’t buy it used. A little confusing at first but once you read the instructions and view a YouTube video of the product it’s pretty simple. I used it to connect one sconce so the neutral and 3 way wire were obsolete. I used the included caps to seal them. Make sure you don’t mix up the line and load wires. My wires were both black. Use a multimeter to check for power then shut the breaker off for safety. My load wire was a thicker gauge wire which made it a simple transfer. The switch was pretty soft to the touch not a loud snap. The dimmer toggle moved smoothly. I will replace other outlets using this item in the future. Btw, I ordered another one via the used but like new option and it was a mess. There is no quality control.\n25#Excellent! Excellent product, most pleased. Worked like a charm.\n26#So Far So Good. We bought this switch to replace a switch that has a round knob. This one works much better for us. If it lasts it will prove to be very good...so far so good.\n27#Delay in slider. There is a slight delay in the diming slider which is frustrating\n28#It flickers. I installed this switch with led lights and they flickered and had a delay turning on.\n29#served my purpose. as expected\n30#Good Stuff. Good Switch. Quality stuff.\n31#There is a pattern of these failing within a year. The dimmer function stopped working for me after 7 months. Before then it was great. If you read the reviews you’ll see a pattern of this so I’d strongly recommend avoiding so you don’t have the hassle of having to buy/install another one.\n32#Light level won't go low enough. I've installed 50 of these over the years, and they've always worked great. But, this latest batch does not allow you to set the minimum light level low enough for my preference. Even using the special AB switch does not make the lights go low enough. All three of the new switches I just bought on Amazon have this problem and on three different sets of lights.\n33#Easy to install. We bought this to put our 4 LED lights on a dimmer. It was easy to install and works great. Would buy again!\n34#works great. Easy install. Works great. Buy it you will like it.\n35#Great functionality. Great switch and dimmer. Read the programming with A and B switches. Min worked great. It should program all 3 levels. Where dimmer is when you move from A to B determines which of the 3 levels you are then setting.\n36#No Faceplate. Please tell me which faceplate to order.\n37#Good, but no Locator LED as Advertised? Install was easy and quality appears to be good, but no Locator LED as stated in specifications. Disappointing as I need to find these switches in the dark (like the old ones I replaced). I double-checked specs before ordering as I knew I needed that feature.\n38#Leviton SureSlide Dimmer Switch for Dimmable LED, Halogen and Incandescent Bulbs. Changed bathroom lighting and then is what we used, works great.\n39#Used junk. Would you believe this is how it arrived? Inside a bag with the package obviously torn open and then taped up. Even the ends are stripped so this was obviously used. Needless to say it didn't work and when I tested it with my volt meter I couldn't open the ckt. What a waste of time.\n40#Dimming stopped working after 8 months. I bought 5 of these to replace old dimmer switches in the house for LED dimming bulbs. Everything was fine until one started failing its dimming features. I changed the bulbs and checked wiring to ensure everything was fine and got another switch which fixed the issue. No switch should have such poor longevity. Would not recommend for my next electric build.\n41#Failed after only 5 months. The light still turns on and off but I can no longer dim it. I installed the dimmer in August and it failed in January. That's only 5 months. Surely they can do better.\n42#Great dimmer switch, no wall plate. I would have given this 5 stars: it works better than others I bought recently on Amazon. The others included a matching wall plate. This does not, and it was difficult to find one that was compatible. Worse, I did not know I needed a wall plate until it was delivered (see small print on dimmer package), since the Amazon description omits this fact.\n43#Scratched with repackaged box. Advertised as new.\n44#Stopped working in 3 months. The slider doesn't work effectively anymore. Its always either high or low. No in between. Sometimes it always stays high even after the slider is on low end. Not worth it. Dont recommend buying it.\n45#Stoped working. After 6 months it stopped working properly. Might be I got a bad one. Worked great until after 6 months.\n46#easy installation. easily installed by do-it-yourselfer\n47#Works great. Replaced older slider dimmer which the cap kept coming off.",
