It works like I thought it would. It's perfect.\n1#Worked for a month. Worked great until it died after a month. Will not buy this brand again\n2#1 year and then died. Worked well for just under 1 year and then it died. Might try another brand.\n3#Set it and forget it device to finally make use of our extra low noise bathroom fan. Great addition to the bathroom. People always forget to turn on the fan when they want to shower and then the mirrors are all foggy. This device takes care of that. As soon as you start showering with the moisture in the room, the fan turns on and after some time it turns the fan off. This is a set it and forget it device finally making use of our extra low noise bathroom fan. 5 Stars!\n4#Didn't Last Long. Unfortunately, mine died. It was installed in mid Nov 24 and lasted until mid March 25. It worked great but now seems completely dead. Power is going to it but the led is not illuminated and neither switch is work. I am very disappointed.\n5#Lasted less than 6 months!!! Worked great while it lasted. It always turned on during a shower and kept the bathroom comfortable. But, after 6 months (bought in July), it wasn't turning the fan on any more after a shower. I initially thought it was just not as humid since we were in the middle of winter and I wasn't seeing any humidity on our mirror. But after it started warming up, the moisture was back on the mirror (which extended down past the level of the switch) and it still wasn't turning the fan on. I even changed the sensitivity to the highest setting. The fan works fine when pressing the fan button so there isn't anything wrong with the fan or wiring. Ended up having to pull it out and replace it with another brand.\n6#Defect after 6 months. do not buy - I should have read all the negative reviews, as both of my units went bad after a couple of months. This must be a defective batch\n7#Doesn’t last. Worked fine for about 8 months then died. The product stopped working completely randomly. Do not recommend.\n8#Looks good, doesn't last. Stopped working after 4 weeks. I had it professionally installed.\n9#All three went bad. Used in two bathrooms that had one fail after a few days and replaced, the replacement failed and replaced with a basic dual switch. Now the one that worked in the second bathroom failed! Going back to a basic dual switch there too! Paid for a professional electrician to install. Expensive lesson.\n10#It was fine. Until it wasn't. It's d-e-d, dead. I read the reviews before purchasing and knew this was a possibility, but also chose to ignore them, thinking the complaints were exaggerated or the installers just didn't know wtf they were doing. Alas, It lasted a mere 69 days before we woke up this morning to find it straight up dead. I guess prior to that, it worked just fine; kicking on about 3 minutes into a steamy shower when I'd forget to turn it on ahead of time... but that doesn't really matter now that it doesn't kick on at all.\n11#Bought 2, the auto humidity sensor never worked on 1 switch. On the 2nd switch it completely stopped working after 3 months.\n12#Just what I was looking for. So far this has worked well. A month into using it, it performs exactly as described. I love the auto timer shut off, which was my main need as my spouse often forgot to turn off the fan. The auto humidity sensor seems to work well, as it kicks on automatically.\n13#Works great to keep bath humidity lower. Easy to install. I like the setting for humidity and that I can set it to run for a time each hour to keep air fresh!\n14#Died, poor customer service. Unfortunately adding to the \"died prematurely\" pile. Worked great for about 5 months. Their tech/ customer service department claims to be unaware this switch has issues despite the numerous online reviews stating it, and make replacement a painful, long process with rude customer service reps who feel free to hang up on you even if the conversation is polite. I wouldn't support this company.\n15#Great switch. Absolutely love this switch, it saves having two switches in the wall. When the fan kicks in the green led light comes on.\n16#Works Surprisingly Well. I was prepared to be disappointed, and bought this switch merely to meet code. It works so well that now I am going to buy another one for another bathroom in my house that I am not remodeling.\n17#Easy to install and works well. Replaced a dual fan/light switch with this. I chose this because I wanted a humidity controlled fan but the light needed to be manual on/off only (over the tub). Lots of other humidity fan/light switches are also occupancy sensing for the light. This one was easy to install, and the default settings on the humidity control and time settings are perfect. (Rapid increase over 50% humidity triggers fan, will run for 20 mins). It will also re-sense after 20 mins and run the fan an additional 10 mins if needed. Pushing the fan button will run the fan for 20 mins, which is needed for households with people who would turn it on and let run for hours and hours without a clue and also don't pay the heat bill.\n18#Works great while it lasted (for a very short time). I have replaced 5 of these switches between my two bathrooms. They lasted anywhere between 2 weeks to 3 months. I finally gave up on this brand after the 5th one went bad after 2 weeks, both the light switch and fan switch will die at the same time. Don't bother with this one unless you want your family complaining about a restroom with no light.\n19#Lasted a month. Shame on me for installing it after the return window, product lasted a month before it stopped working.\n20#Easy to install and super effective. I underestimated how nice this would be. I no longer need to worry about turning on the bathroom fan, and this turns it off automatically too. Absolutely worth the money.\n21#A Smart and Space-Saving Solution. I needed to make room in the switch box in my bathroom for another light, so I used this to combine the fan control along with the built in light. The sensor has been working flawlessly. It accurately detects humidity levels and turns the fan on at the default setting of around 65%. I've had no issues with false triggering, and the sensor has been a reliable addition to my home.\n22#Stopped working after 3 weeks. Worked great for the first 3 weeks. The humidistat worked perfectly turning on and shutting off after the specified time. Then nothing. Totally dead. Called tech support and they sent me an email that I have to ship it to their “quality” department for evaluation. I pulled the switch out and mocked up a test platform to make sure it wasn’t something in my installation, but I still have to ship it back at my expense. 5 year warranty, whoopie if I have to go through this to get a new one that hopefully lasts longer.\n23#Lasted a month. Purchase two of these for my mother's place. One installed in master lasted two weeks, the other in the hall lasted 4 weeks.\n24#Muli-Functional but potentially not the most durable. Its a great find as it has the humidity sensor built in to the switch that controls both the fan and the light. After I figured out how to program it, it worked very well... for 2 weeks and then had to order another one. The second seems to be more durable. Aside from that it works very well and turn on/off when humidity is present. Has been great to have and I have noticed less humidity overall.\n25#Failed after one month. Installed easily. Programmed easily. Worked flawlessly… for a month. And then dead. An expensive mistake.\n26#Broke after two months. This switch ceased to function after two months of use.\n27#Cheap. I installed this and it broke after a couple of weeks.\n28#Works for about 3 months. Product stops working after 3 months.\n29#Broke within 4 months and company won't replace. Buyer beware. The switch completely stopped working 4 months after installation and there are no returns or refunds. I contacted the manufacturer and after 2 weeks of considering, they determined that I would need to ship the defective switch to them at my expense so that they could decide if they are willing to replace. This is the last Leviton product I'll be buying, it's not worth the hassle and the products clearly aren't good quality.\n30#Perfect light and fan combo switch! Good quality, looks nice, and does its job really well! It’s the only switch I’ve seen that has both a light switch with fan sensor and it’s good. Never turns on randomly like others I’ve used. It turns on when actually necessary. Pricey but I’m happy.\n31#Unreliable. Bought the switch because it did exactly what I needed. When it works, it works well. Reliability is an issue. First one might have been an open box, but I didn't notice. Amazon exchanged it. Since then, I've had 2 more failures. Leviton has a 5 year warranty on this, so I submitted it for replacement. They've sent me replacements, so that's good, but I'm getting tired of rewiring an old switch back in every time I need it replaced. Replacement is not sent until they receive their old one back, so it takes over a week for each one. If it didn't cost so much, I'd probably go another route, but I'm determined to get my 5 years out of it.\n32#Good easy to use switch. Not sure why it's asking about Alexa integration? It literally is just a dumb switch for humidity, fan, and light. Single slot, it's very nice and easy to setup/change options while being simple and brain dead easy to use.\n33#Stops working. Bought 2 for both my bathrooms. One quit working, right before the return window but was able to swap for another. Month later went out again, but out of return window. Learned my lesson not gonna try a third time\n34#Used had burnt wire! why sell a product with a burned wire??? Not ok. Then bought another one bc this brand is suppose to be the best and well now here we are, past the return point. Paid $600 to have this switch and an exhaust fan with roof vent installed and today it just stopped working!\n35#Works well, did exactly what it was supposed to do. This works well, it seems to mange the humidity level well.\n36#will automatically turn off in 20 minutes if the humidity is low enough. This is awesome , I was going to put a timer on the fan so it doesn't get , This will shut off after 20 minutes and if the humidity is high enough it will run for another 20 minutes after about 2 minutes off, Or if you forget to turn on the fan when you get in the shower it will turn on when the humidity is high enough, the default settings are high sensitivity 20 minutes run time seems perfect for my small bathroom\n37#Does not last. This seemed like a great idea and actually worked great for a little while. I'm on my 2nd switch as the 1st one only worked for about 3 months. I will update on this replacement. **Update After 3rd one did not last 3 weeks gave up!\n38#Awesome. Works perfectly\n39#1 of 5 stopped working after 3weeks. I installed these in our bathrooms. 1 has stopped working after just a few weeks. They are nice for making sure fans are run when they should be but unfortunate there may be reliability issues. Install/removal also takes a little longer switching back and forth from post style switches to this switch with 5 stranded wires and wire nuts. I may try again as the auto on/off is worth it to me.\n40#Works for 2 weeks. I bought one of these and worked great for two weeks and then stopped working. I ordered a replacement and it worked two weeks and stopped. I have other timers that are similar but have a neutral wire and they function fine. I had it installed by a good electrician so u know it’s done properly. These apparently are just poorly made or a bad batch.\n41#Light is MANUAL ONLY!! NO OCCUPANCY DETECTION. I'm generally pretty intentional when making purchases and purchased this with the expectation that both the light and the fan were automated. I like this company and I've used a number of their automatic light switches before. The description doesn't say the light is manual, only that the fan is automatic. Furthermore, it says: \"Advanced Sensing Detection Modern look with advanced technology that minimizes false triggers when room is occupied\" Why would a humidity only sensor care if the room is occupied or not? Anyway, the company is fine, the switch is fine (it's chunky but not as chunky as a wifi smart switch, so you need a big, but not huge box) - I'm just super annoyed that I installed this thing and couldn't figure out how the auto light worked only to find out it doesn't have one. Plus pushing the button is way more annoying than flipping a traditional switch. Bleh.\n42#Very user friendly humidity sensor switch. I installed this switch with a fan/light combo fixture and it was very simple to install and set up. I had to pull a new 14/3 romex to replace the 40 year old 14/2 wire original with the house, but connecting this switch was a breeze. The programming instructions are also very easy to understand. The switch functions great, turning on automatically about a minute into a shower, and turning off automatically after the programmed duration. Its a little pricey, but I'm confident this switch will effectively reduce the humidity in this mold-prone bathroom.\n43#Works great. I like this product because it does the work on its own soon as it detects hummidity it turns on the exhaust fan on since my teenage daughter never thinks of turning it on when she takes a 1 hour shower.\n44#Great switch buttons could be better. The switch is great and works great but it could be better. Leviton has a good reputation, so I purchased this one but it's still missing like light at the buttons and still waiting on reliability, had it for a month now and it's really good could not find anything better and the competition was a little better but an unknown name, so went for reliability. I'll update on the summer to see how it performs with the humidity here. Worth the purchase, no need for 2 switches and humidity detector for when people forget to turn on the fan is a big plus.\n45#Nice could use auto light off. Need a non neutral wire set up. Almost exactly what I need. Auto on and auto off for the bathfan is great. Just wish it had an auto off for the light. Durability to be determine not installed long enough to know yet.\n46#Worth the money. My son kept forgetting to run the fan when he showered so I ordered this switch. It comes on by itself and doesn't take that long to kick on once I have the shower going. Maybe a minute or so. If you turn the fan on manually, the fan will shut off by itself after 20 minute which is nice. A lot of times I'll run the fan then leave for work and don't have to worry about it being on all day. You can change the setting on it to be less sensitive and the amount of time the fan runs but I was fine with the way it came programmed. I was worried it wouldn't be that great especially for how much it cost but it works a lot better than expected Update 4/2025 My first switch stopped working for the fan part of it so I called the customer service and they sent me another one right away. Their custoer service is domestic which is nice. The second switch has been running flawlessly since I've installed it. Glad they stand behind their product. They even had me mail the old switch in so they could see why it failed. They paid the postage and I got the new switch before I got the return postange e mail so getting the new one was not contingent on sending the old one in.\n47#Best gadget in our house. Love the automatic fan mode! Our bathroom gets so humid and this feature has helped so much and keeps our shower cleaner!\n48#Nifty switch. Fantastic bathroom switch. The fan can be set to turn off after a set amount of time-- no more fan running throughout the night. Also great that it can be set to automatically sense humidity and turn on if someone forgets. This switch is ideal if you have tenants or kids that forget easily.\n49#Works as advertised. Easy installation. Fan comes on and turns off automatically.",
