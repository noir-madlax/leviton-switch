Product came used . Package ripped up and paint on the switch . I don’t know if it works yet as I haven’t installed it. Update : does not work Dimmer switch was not working\n1#Great feature. Easy to install. Elegant in bathroom. Color is great & functions as expected using the rocker & dimmer. Pleased.\n2#Not good. Not good. Makes the bulbs flicker and sometimes they won't come on and you have to move the dimmer in order to make them work. Legrand has a revised/newer dimmer version that actually works pretty good but this one is BAD!\n3#Works great with Feit LED lights. Purchased to use with Feit LED Recessed Retrofit Lights. This dimmer switch works great with my sting of 4 ceiling can lights. Also got this from Amazon Warehouse and it was like new condition, in the original package.\n4#A quality Switch. Quick shipping, easy installation, works great A+++\n5#Color not as pictured but a nice switch. The color is not as pictured, but the switch seems sturdy and the slider is smooth.\n6#Dimmer. Work as should!\n7#A little pricey but worth it. I looked for a dimmer with a broader slide and this was the best fit with color and functionality. Electrician installed without issue and did not tell me of any problems.\n8#Great for LED lighting. Hard to find color in brick and mortar stores. Easy push in install.\n9#Works as expected. Works as expected. Bit expensive for what it is but I could not find it anywhere else.\n10#works great. Switch arrived on time. Works perfectly.\n11#Failed after two years. This $32 dimmer switch failed after two years, used in a bathroom controlling LED vanity lights. The dimmer would not stay at full brightness. You could move the slide back and forth to get it to full brightness but then it would just dim to maybe 50% brightness. I replaced this switch with another model and all is fine now. This switch was designed to be as cost effective (profit margin for Lutron - not savings for consumer) using an all plastic plate that attaches to the box. I'm sure the electronics were sourced as cheaply as possible too. This switch probably has a cost to Lutron of a couple of bucks. Light switches should last many years but the cheaper they're made, the shorter they last. Just slap a designer name on a switch and triple the price. Pathetic...\n12#Works as described. Looks great, works as described.\n13#High quality, classy, pricey. Pros: Click feel is awesome, (the ones I replaced were very anemic feeling, gave way to easily with no Click!) snappy and responsive Looks gorgeous Easy to clean LED makes it easy to find at night/in the dark Compatible with my dimmable recessed lights No buzz or hum Dimmer Slider is sturdy with no play, very precise Perfect fit with standard boxes and gang plates Cons Pricey (but worth it) Was not compatible with my smart bulbs (HUE) (but the non dimmer version is!) Notes and Unknowns: HUE compatibility not really important if you use HUE switches and apps by if you use a mix of bulbs or have several lights on one switch it’s good to know.\n14#As advertised. Item was received quickly and works as advertised\n15#Flickers no matter what kind of bulb is used & terrible tech support. Installation was very difficult. Either I have a smaller-than-standard electrical box, or this thing is too big. I have tried three different kinds of dimmable bulbs, two LED and one CFL. The light flickers with all three, even on full power. I emailed tech support and never got a response. I called tech support and got disconnected. I called back and was referred to a list of compatible bulbs - from 2012. The listed bulbs are no longer available. I’ve spent so long trying to get this thing to work that the Amazon return window has close, so I’m resigned to swallowing the cost of the dimmer, the plate cover (which was extra), and three sets of bulbs. Maybe the bulbs will work with the next dimmer switch. This one is going in the garbage.\n16#Great dimmer switch. We had an on/off switch for our LED patio lights but decided we wanted the option to dim them. This switch works perfectly.\n17#Basic switch. Working well\n18#Good quality. Product is very nice. Looks great\n19#Modern look and performance. Looks great and works exactly as intended.\n20#Five Stars. Worked just like it should. Nice fit/finish as well.",
