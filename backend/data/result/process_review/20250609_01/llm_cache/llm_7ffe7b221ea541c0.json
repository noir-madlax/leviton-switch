Will periodically flicker the lights. Adjust the wheel and at some time in the future the lights will flicker and you have to repeat the process. finally got tired of adjusting the switch and bought new ones.\n1#Works great. Worked as advertised. Upon checking the reviews, some said the dimmers caused humming. We haven't noticed any humming or lights flickering.\n2#Oh these dimmers. Worked great easy install..\n3#Topgreener digital dimmer light switch. Very poor quality. I paid $50.00 for this product and 2 of the switches have burned out already. Not worth the money. I wish I could be reimburse for it. I bought it in late February of 2024.\n4#they work and ship quickly. easy to install\n5#Bad quality. It does not dim. Sometimes it does even turn on the light.\n6#Do not buy. These switches are crap. Some don't work out of the box. The others only work for 2 days\n7#Was worried they would be compatible with my new LED lights. Read reviews that they may now work with multiple LED lights. I ordered all new LED light and even though I got the dimmable ones they were way too bright. My husband said it they were no issues with installation and I love the type of switch on them....game changer!\n8#Not quality. Can’t dim to lower settings\n9#works well, now my lights are dimmable. works well, now my lights are dimmable. I like that they skipped an on/off switch and used the dimmable slide as on/off Giver you larger knob to grab on\n10#Poor quality, get what you pay for. We updated all our switches and plugs recently and added a number of dimmers. I purchased these because of the affordable price. Regret not spending more for a better product. Soon after installation several of them broke with the switch not working and had to be replaced. Return window had closed, super inconvenient for lights to stop working. Would not recommend.\n11#Not what I was expecting... Purchased these to add dimming capabilities to some new LED lighting I was installing. Unfortunately, the dimmer switches felt very cheaply made, gave unreliable outputs (sometimes it dimmed properly, sometimes it didn't dim at all), adjustments to the wheel setting seemed to have little impact on fixing the inconsistent dimming issue. I was forced to return the units.\n12#Simple dimmers at a decent price. Very basic dimmer, but price is better than purchasing in store. Easy to install and adjust.\n13#Worked as expected. The switch was easy to install, worked as expected. I needed a three option, so had to return which was simple. It looks nice and sleek and all the tools came with the packaging.\n14#light dimmer switches. works great! just what i need. thanks\n15#Junk. Bought a six pack & 4 months in, had to replace 2 so far, Just stopped working.\n16#defective. Really wanted to like these. After only 2-3 months they are starting to go out. In my bedroom when it would be turned out, it would flicker really bad and it wasn’t the bulb, we changed it just in case. But after changing the light switch, it stopped. In my daughters room, it stopped working all together. Wouldn’t turn on at all anymore. After changing the light switch, we didn’t have any problems..\n17#Price is good. Didn't like the back side of the dimmer switch because it was to big for a 2x4 box it barely fit.",
