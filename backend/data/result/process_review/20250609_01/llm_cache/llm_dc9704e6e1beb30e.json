After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Three Way Multi-Location Control Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Three Way Multi-Location Control Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment. Include all mentioned reasons, or \"?\" if none can be inferred. <USE_REASON> and <USE> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- <PHYSICAL>/<PERF> and <DETAIL> MUST NOT include:\n  * Generic statements without details (e.g., \"good\", \"bad quality\")\n  * Issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., \"fast shipping\", \"delivery time\")\n- If a review mentions any physical aspect, related performance, or use together, extract them as separate entries under \"phy,\" \"perf,\" and \"use,\" with no overlap.\n- Make sure each <DETAIL> is under the most relevant <PHYSICAL> or <PERF> in the context of Three Way Multi-Location Control Switches\n- Preserve negations\n\nKey Instructions:\n- Break down reviews with multiple aspects, performances, or uses into individual entries.\n- Escape special characters with backslash that could cause JSON syntax errors.\n- Include only explicitly mentioned reasons, and use \"?\" where no reason is mentioned.\n\nFinal Checklist:\n- Go through all reviews and ensure that no aspect, performance, use, or reason is omitted, even if only mentioned once.\n- Review all entries to ensure proper separation between aspects, performances, and uses.\n\nPrint the JSON result only.\nInput format:\n<ID>#<review>\n\n[[INPUT]]\n0#Good Quality.
