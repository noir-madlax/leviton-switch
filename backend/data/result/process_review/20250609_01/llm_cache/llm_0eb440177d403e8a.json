Old house (built before electricity) had one in kitchen that became useless. This has been installed and used regularly for a year. No complaints\n2#Eaton duplex toggle switches. These Switches were top quality.\n3#Works well. I purchased this for use in a garage so the switch making noise is not an issue. It work well.\n4#A switch that costs this much should be silent rather than snappy and loud clicking. I could have bought a cheap switch that would be as good as this one. Rather than operate quietly, it clicks loudly as it snaps from one position to another. I have 45 years of experience and Eaton is usually top quality, but not so on this one. I'll go to Home Depot and get one that is quiet.\n5#Works as intended! Since someone wired the original in a strange way,(I am not an electrician), I just mimicked the way the old one was on. The old with was installed from the get go, and it was malfunctioning for a long time. Very happy to have a new one!\n6#HEAVY DUTY. WORKS GREAT AND FEELS VERY PRECISION COMPARED TO CHEAPER SWITCHES.\n7#Very easy to use. I am not an electrician but a quick search on YouTube and I was able to replace a light switch that had been giving me problems for years.\n8#recommend you have experience installing electrical items! Iam a licensed electrician,items like this are getting harder to purchase!\n9#Works as intended. Replacement for existing switch that failed. Easy to install and works as intended. A bit overpriced, however it’s a specialty item.\n10#Does not fit curved edge utility box cover. In general, I am a big fan of Cooper Wiring devices and have used many different types in the past. This is the first time I have run into a problem. Most outlet / switch devices have ears that can be snapped off to mount them in a utility box with a curved edge top. These particular switches have snap off ears, but after they are snapped off, the remaining tab sticks up so high that they will not fit under the curved edge cover for a utility box. I put a Cooper Wiring outlet into a 4x4 Raco box on one side by snapping off the ears. But when I tried to mount this Cooper Wiring switch on the other side in the same box, I saw that after snapping off the ears, it would not fit. I had to use heavy pliers to manually bend part of the tab down enough so it would fit, but not so much that the bent section would interfere with the screw mount. The tab is a heavy gauge metal and is very difficult to bend. If I ever have to do this type of install again, I will have to use a different model switch. Now you know what to expect. For a regular wall mount, these should be fine.\n11#Works great. Works as it should. Could never catch in stock at local stores.\n12#TOO LOUD TO USE. It's a toggle switch. What could go wrong? Never thought that you could hear it across the house when you turn it off or on. Can't use it. Too LOUD.\n13#Reliable. As expected no surprises!\n14#Easy Replacement. This was an easy job to replace my broken light switch\n15#Exactly what we needed. When we doing all our lights switches and outlets in the house, we needed a couple of these that the local big box stores did not have in white. These are priced the same as a big box stores (other colors same switch) so it was nice to be able to get the color we were after. And have it shipped so quickly. These are quality switches. Easy to install\n16#Greats product. As described. Fast shipping. Greats product. As described. Fast shipping\n17#Not your average toggle switch. Nice heavy duty switch, really solid click on toggle.\n18#Just what I needed. Needed a double switch for bathroom light & fan. Perfect. Although, be aware that this version is very \"clicky\" so if you don't want to hear a loud CLACK! everytime you turn the switch on/off pay attention to what you are looking at (because I didn't). Not a deal killer tho, but definitely not like all of my other switches which have a smoother, softer action.\n19#Stiff and loud. It works great, but is very stiff and makes a loud click when you switch it on or off.\n20#Defective. The bottom switch did not work.\n21#Instant on lighting. Lights go on, lights go off. All you could ask for.\n22#Not a quiet switch. This is a very loud switch * 2 it's a snapper.\n23#Good replacement. Worked as replacement\n24#Easy to install at a affordable price. Very easy to install & an affordable price.\n25#Same as the old one. Exactly the same fit as the 20year old one it replaced. Works great.\n26#Good product. Works like it should. Everything as expected.\n27#Worked like a champ. Worked like a champ, I use it to split a line feed to 2 separate circuits.\n28#thick switch levers. the switch levers are fat. different but it works great for my house\n29#Good quality switch. Reasonably priced\n30#Easy. Easy to install\n31#Fair price. Nice quality product\n32#Buen producto. Buen precio\n33#Works as should. Its a double light switch. Works as should and a few dollars cheaper then a lowes switch\n34#Works great, and solidly built. The installation was straight forward, the switch unit was built well, no problem with it. The switch itself works great, very \"snappy\". Great product.\n35#Highly recommend. High quality switch with a strong snap, fast shipping and good price, highly recommend.\n36#Feels Heavy Duty. Feels more like an industrial switch than a residential one. The throw is a bit stiff at first with a click a bit louder than expected. Switch style does not match Leviton toggle shape. But, its a perfectly good switch. No complaints about quality or function at all.\n37#No quality Seems fine to me. It’s been a one month I am using it in the washroom so far does not have any problem work fine\n38#Solid switch. Top of the line electrical switch. Two single pole switches in a single gang box.\n39#Works good. Works good... Cheaper than what the electrician would of charged for his switch\n40#didn't work. it didn't work\n41#It works but too hard to install using a pre-formed loop on the wires. It works just fine. I was replacing a broken switch. The wires were looped to be screwed down. But it was so hard to push the wire into the right place to screw it down.\n42#EATON 271W-BOX Arrow Hart 271W Duplex Grounding Toggle Switch. Fast shipping. I don't have Amazon Prime. Ordered on 4/24 through a seller on Amazon without having to do a $25 minimum purchase. Arrived 4/29. Went to Home Depot first. Saw the line. Came back. Replacement for a 25+ year old Leviton switch. This Eaton switch's wiring configuration is slightly different than Leviton but overall an easy install. Yet to see if it will last as long as the old Leviton switch. It's a toggle switch. Does make a click sound. Doesn't bother me.\n43#Yep. Works as expected\n44#Just what I needed. I have one of these dual switch units in my kitchen hooked up to a light and the garbage disposal. I went to Home Depot and Lowes to replace it thinking it was a common thing - but neither had it. I should have looked on Amazon first. It was delivered next day and worked like a charm.\n45#Solid Design; Works Great; A Little Tricky To Install. This switch seems to be a pretty solid design. Switches are thick - which I like - since my previous toggle switch handle broke off. Guess that's what happens over time. Installation wasn't too bad. Although, I would say to be sure you read the instructions to understand which wiring diagram applies to your application. There is a 'metal tab' that needs to remain in place for certain switching arrangements, but broken/removed for others. I would say this is the only 'trickery' involved. Otherwise, solid switch from EATON. Have been using for 1 week - so far so good!\n46#Great quality. Exactly what we needed. Easy install!",
