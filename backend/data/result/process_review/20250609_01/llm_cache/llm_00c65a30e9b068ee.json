The product I received was defective for 3-Way Switching application.\n1#Good item. Works perfectly\n2#Flickers when dimmed. Initially install very easy. In a led light when the light is dimmed, the light flickers and the switch makes a buzz sound. Tried a second switch the same kind, same thing. Got different brand dimmer and it works fine. If you want a switch, it works, but don’t bank on the dimmer part working.\n3#Works well. This is a very useful switch, however you need to make sure your light source can work with dimmers\n4#A great dimmer. Great price! Easy to install. No flicker. Works great. Looks great. Perfect.\n5#Great price. Great price\n6#Great product. Works well. Creates ambiance in each room\n7#Excellent for Recessed Lighting. I am replacing all of my ceiling lights with recessed lights. This dimmer was simple to install and I love it! I will be using them for all of my recessed lighting.\n8#The lights keep blinking. Not so good\n9#Go with name brand. These have been completely unreliable. Cause my LED puck lights to flicker. Two have failed completely. One won’t stay on, the other won’t stay off\n10#Great price and quality switch for single or multiple poles. I recently upgraded my old ceiling light that offers dimming feature. So I needed to replace old 3 way switches to this 3 way dimmer switches. This was easy to install and fit well with other dimmer switch design I have. As compared to to expensive brands in Lowe’s and Home Depot, this is budget friendly, good looking and quality switches. Will be buying more to replace other old switches I have.\n11#Be very sure you want thus before you purchase. I returned these because they were inferior. It has been 3 weeks and this vendor has still not refunded me. Only \"delays\". Buyer beware of this vendor\n12#Fits in crowded junction box. These dimmers are excellent with LEDs, and come with their own finishing plate. Best of all they are SLIM and can be installed in a crowded junction box. Most dimmers are quite thick and difficult, or even impossible, to get into a busy junction box.\n13#Nice switch. The dimmer works just fine but the dimmer doesn't come with a cover. No one has champagne colored covers. It should be included with the switch.\n14#Sleek Design and Smooth Operation! The BESTTEN Super Slim Dimmer Light Switch exceeded my expectations! Installation was incredibly straightforward, even in my older home where space in the electrical boxes is limited. The ultra-slim profile fits perfectly and looks sleek on the wall. I love the quiet rocker feature—dimming is silent and smooth, making it ideal for bedrooms and living areas. This dimmer handles everything I throw at it, from LED and CFL bulbs to incandescent lights, with seamless performance. The added bonus of not needing a neutral wire simplified the setup significantly. Overall, it's a fantastic upgrade that brings both style and functionality to my home!\n15#Work good. I like this product\n16#Bought 3 in January 2024 and 1 failed in October 2024. Ordered 3 last January, in October one failed - it flips back to the OFF position when you let go. As long as the switch is held in the ON position the light stays on (it is a mechanical problem). Of the 2 remaining, one is silent and the other switches with a loud click. The installation instructions were clear and installation was easy.\n17#Not the best quality, but good enough for the price. The rocker switch is not the best quality; it easily comes apart. One of the 3 switches came defective (slider for dimmer is inop). Spend a little more $$ for a better quality switch.\n18#Depends on load or had a bad one. 2 out of 3 worked great and the price is better than the local stores. This were installed to control lights in standard light fixtures and worked great. Did NOT work with those thin recess lights with built in LEDs. My leds are dimmable (said so on box) as they worked with an expensive name brand dimmer from the local hardware store. Just be aware may not work with all dimmable lights.\n19#Flickers, do not recommend. Horrible cheap product. Switch feels flimsy and causes the lights to flicker at lower level. Now have to pay electrician again to take these off\n20#Solved a big problem... I have been searching for years for a dimmer that was thin enough to fit in my electrical box from 1964. Normal dimmers were too \"deep\" to fit, and I could never get them to sit flush with the wall so I could get the switch cover back on. I came across this product by chance, and boy am I glad I did! It's fits perfect, and now I don't have a big ol' switch hanging exposed out of the wall! Success At Last!\n21#Functional. Compact design works well.\n22#Slim but causes LEDs to flicker. Dimmers are nice but unfortunately cause lights to flicker when other appliances are running.\n23#Average dimmer. Like the fact they’re very shallow but bought three and one is already defective\n24#Cheap and works great. No issues using this switch on LED track lights or standard LED bulbs. Great price and nice look\n25#Nice click, an easy slide dimmer, and a slim profile to boot, but DANGEROUS for the beginner. This must be one of the slimmest dimmer switches I have seen in recent memory, extending only 22mm into the box and leaving plenty of room for wire nuts or lever nuts. Installation is like any other 3-way switch; just hook up line, neutral and load wires and put it all back in the box. However, I was a bit dismayed to find that the traveler wire was pre-stripped and NOT capped out of the box. If you're a beginner and you don't realize this, then you're asking for a huge problem as 120V AC comes off this spare wire while the switch is in the OFF position (when you might think it is safe)! While capping this line is noted in the docs, this can present a huge problem for the novice who doesn't realize this and repacks the switch into a metal box with impunity. Beyond that, though, I tested the unit with several LED bulbs and panels, and each dimmed as advertised, and the adjustment wheel can help to fine-tune the light output, too.\n26#Works Perfectly for My Application But... Went to replace the light switch in my office with a dimmer. After removing the old switch I discovered that the switch box was being used as a junction box. Purchased these slim dimmers but there still wasn't enough room to cram everything in, so needed to purchase an outlet extender. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008SDN1DE?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details The photos show both this product and the outlet extender. Happy with the outcome.\n27#Performance. It's a rocking switch that has audible click when it's turned ON or OFF, it isn't quiet. The worse of it is that it doesn't work well with LED lights, it doesn't keep them from flickering the only way to stop that nuisance is to move the dimmer slider all the way to maximum; so, it works like a regular rocking light switch, not like a dimmer.\n28#Value dimmers that work. Ordered these BESTTEN 3 Pack Super Slim Digital Dimmer Light Switch, Quiet Rocker as I am a journeyman electrician and like to test out the products I see come through Vine. Sometimes a bit of a risk as I'd say only 50% of them I am able to actually use on jobs. These dimmers passed the test. They came packaged in a branded cardboard box with each dimmer in an individual box. They include great instructions, a screwless faceplate and all necessary hardware. The feel of them is considerably lighter and thinner than the gold standard Lutron dimmers, but they are about 1/3 the price. Slimmer and lighter in nature with no LED illumination to let you know if they are on or what the power level is set at. The slider is my favorite style of dimmer as that allows a very intuitive memory setting and you can still use the paddle switch for on and off. The rocker is silent and feels a little bit cheap but works well. Can be wired in single pole or 3 way configurations. I only tested the single pole application using a dimmable fixture. The response was good with no flicker, Not quite as responsive in the low range. It even dimmed a non-dimmable fixture fairly well with no flicker at a few output levels. I teetered between 4 and 5 stars on this product, for the price they are excellent and the packaging/instructions/branding is also excellent. I ended up going with 4 stars because of the build quality with the caveat that for the price they exceed my expectations, while not being the kind of dimmer you would get for spending 3 times as much.\n29#it is not recommended. Product of average quality. It does not work properly with LED lights, even those under 300W and dimmable, as suggested by the product. It generates noise, a kind of buzzing, in the LED light driver. Therefore, it is not recommended.\n30#Non Fonctionnel. Sur les 3 boites 2 étaient déjà ouverte (usagé boite endommagé et fils ) et ne fonctionnait pas. Le seul interrupteur fonctionnel est celui non ouvert. Je suis très surpris de recevoir des boites usagées !\n31#Dont work well. I dont know if its just my luck but I had 2 out of 3 that worked, 1 the dimmer wasnt working at all and the second was doing a humming sound witch is not good. These were also installed by a licensed electrician. Returned them since they didnt work. Too bad was really wanting some good slim dimmers\n32#Good product. Good quality\n33#Parfait. Déjà installée\n34#2/3 in the package worked. One was a complete dud. Two of the switches connected and work fine. One of them turned the light on but the dimmer didn’t work, and the light was stuck on the lowest brightness setting. I paid an electrician to install them, and I can’t return just the one dud. Consider another option.\n35#Failed after 3 months. Purchased 6 of them and one has failed. No contact included to get ahold of seller",
