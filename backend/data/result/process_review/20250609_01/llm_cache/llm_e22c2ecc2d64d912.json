After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Single Pole Rocker Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Single Pole Rocker Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment.

Great item and good price\n2#Good. Good quality\n3#Muy bueno. Si me agrado\n4#Color is not white. Bought white switches but they are almost light gray color.\n5#Multiple have broken. I’ve had to replace many of them after only 2 years of use. The hinge is plastic and breaks. I’ve also had some of the toggles themselves crack down the middle. Spend a little more for better quality.\n6#Good value for the money. Great price work well\n7#I love rocket switches. Perfect for my retire job 9n my house.\n8#Great switch for the price. I bought 40 switches. I’m not an electrician but im pretty handy around the house. I installed them. It was very easy. So far so good. I would definitely recommend this product.\n9#Easy. Remodel in house\n10#Works as expected. Works as expected\n11#Works. Works and fits in spot where switch was. Great value.\n12#Kind of gray in color. Sort of cheap, as expected. After all, they’re not Leviton. Most notably is that they are somewhat gray looking when contrasted with a white cover plate.\n13#White, yes… but off white. Just a heads up. Suuper easy to install but a little frustating after i had installed 20 switches to see that they were an off white. After comparing a different switch that needed a slot for a travel wire that was a true white color. Would return if i wanted to go through the process of switching them all back out.\n14#Pretty but... Bought a 20 pack and 3 of them don't work or broke with one use.\n15#I missing order light switch. Miss light switch is not in the box.\n16#Best value. These were super easy to install and look great. Great value and will definitely buy again.\n17#Looks good but very cheap products. I don’t recommend it\n18#Value for your money. When I received the switcher, as soon as I touch it, I realized it was worth the money!!!\n19#Not Quite Right. The color is off white on the grey side. It says it can handle 12 or 14 gauge but 12 gauge doesn’t quite fit. The hole for the wire is a little too small.\n20#perfect modern switches. Easy to install.Great value for mone. Look great in a home.\n21#Great Product. The instillation was easy and they were a great upgrade for our house.\n22#Nice updated look! We changed all the switches in our house. They look great and we're really easy to install.\n23#work great. easy to install, and great value upgrade\n24#Single pole outlet. Easy to install. Fits outlets perfectly. Very clean look.\n25#Mixed product in box. The switches seem to work just fine, but a mix of glossy and matte white switches were in the box and the difference is noticeable from 10 feet away. Had to re-buy 10 at the store to make things look consistent.\n26#Would recommend great buy. Exactly the quality size and color as you would get at lowest for less then half the price",
