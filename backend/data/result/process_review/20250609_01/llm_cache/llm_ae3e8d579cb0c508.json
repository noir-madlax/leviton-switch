Device works great. Good warranty. Newer Jasco aka GE Embrighten aka UltraPro (all the same, Ultrapro is simple packaging and cheaper priced but same hardware) in white do not match the older ones. The New models have bluer paddles, don't match old ones. Older ones matched faceplate from Leviton at Home Depot. See picture. New one on the right. If you have old, dead devices, you can salvage their paddles to make them match. But note the pull plug under the paddle of dimmers and switches is longer in the new model, so you'll have to use that bluer pull pin with your older, color matched paddle.\n1#Work Great. Use these by majority over off/on ones.\n2#Beware short lifespan. They work great and connect to alarm system for scene control. However, only 3 out of 8 devices in 4 years are still working. 2 died in the first year. I gave it 5 stars for it's compatibility and usability and subtracted 3 for the unreliability.\n3#works for 3 years. this worked fine with everything except leds. after 3 years it started blinking blue, and never worked again.\n4#buttons are stupidly hard to press. the buttons on this switch are stupidly hard to press. requires a much firmer push than any of the other enbrighten/GE/jasco switches i have throughout the rest of the house. this results in having to press the switch multiple times to get it to work, since the first time usually isn't hard enough. seriously, it's ridiculous how different the button feel is from any of the other swiches.\n5#Great switch, till it stops working. Bought and I stalled the switch at the end of June 2024. It's now Sep 23rd, and the switch worked fine last night, and today it's dead. No longer working. The blue indicator light goes on and off to indicate that the switch is cycling, but the lights don't come on. This is the second time this has happened with one of these switches. Of course, I'm past the return/customer support window. So, buyer beware!\n6#Would not operate a Chandelier. I wired this up according to the instructions given for a multi-way setup. Firstly, these do not support secure inclusion in Home Assistant, but after understanding that, I went ahead with the configuration. Firstly I put the switch in standard mode since I have dumb switches in the circuit. After that, I tried operating the switch from the z-wave switch, and although the status changed, the switch did not turn on the lights. I then went to one of the dumb switches, and again the status changed, but the light did not turn on. The seem to only work well either in a single pole setup or with the companion switch which is not the ideal setup for me, so I am going to try other options. As an aside; the fixture I was trying to operate was only 90W, but when I moved this to a single light, it worked fine.\n7#Good range. I installed this in a shed about 60 ft from our house, so I can turn on the light remotely. The switch connects to the house Wi-Fi perfectly. Minus 1 star because the switch manual operation is a bit unusual. You press only the bottom half of the switch to turn the light both on and off.",
