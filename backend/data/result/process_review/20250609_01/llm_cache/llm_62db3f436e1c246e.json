Good product connection should be done well\n1#Switch. Arrived on time undamaged. Very easy to install as a dimmer for our UFO lights. Works well.\n2#Correct for the application. Dimmer $ is as described.\n3#Dimming is very limited, expected more from Eaton. Dimming is very limited, expected more from Eaton\n4#Works great. Bought an led spotlight and didn't know it had low voltage dimming, so I had to buy this. Works good.\n5#absolute crap quality. set screw was fused and would not tighten. unscrewed it and was not able to get it back into the threaded/stripped stopper. crap quality screw rendered a $30 dimmer junk. never buying this crap brand again.\n6#This is a great dimmer at a great price. Clear instructions. Comes with different colors to choose from. It has been working great now for months. Would definitely buy again.\n7#this is for the LED with seperate brightness controls! gray black and purple wiring harness pigtail? this is what u need! dims your Lowes Dimmable LED perfectly!\n8#Bought 4 1 is not working properly. They wouldn’t refund switch that doesn’t work properly but 3 out of 4 work\n9#Great Price and quick Delivery. Great Price. Quick delivery\n10#The installation instructions were confusing. Switch had a 0-10V dimmer controller. While there was a simple connection diagram there were no instructions on testing the dimmer. I expected to be able to test the 0-10V dimmer part of the switch with a VOM, but it only seemed to work when it was connected to the LED Controller in light fixture.\n11#They seem cheaply made and two didn't work right. Lights on a couple of these were dimmer than others. All lights were the same flat panel LED's. I replaced the lights. no change. Turns out the dimmer was the problem.\n12#Install complicated by a stripped screw. The switch is working perfectly, but I had a little snag with installation. I got this for a shop light that came with a dimmer cable. It was easy to wire up and the instructions helped me understand that on-off part of the switch operates on the main power and the dimmer circuit works on the 0-10v part. This wasn't really apparent to me before I read the instructions. This was a single pole install. The main power load (black wire) passes through the switch at the brass \"Y\" terminal and the black \"common\" terminal. The brass screw on the \"Y\" terminal was stripped - it was very difficult to turn in either direction. The nut fell off of it while I tried to fit the wire in place. Because it was stripped, I simply couldn't get the nut back on without disassembling the switch and tapping the screw through it on the workbench. This added more than a half hour overall to the installation process which would have been very quick and easy otherwise. I am sure this was a one-off issue, but three stars due to whatever quality control process allowed this to slip through. Anyway, The price was reasonable compared to other dimmers and extra points to Eaton Controls because the switch had four small screws that allowed access to the internal parts of the device.\n13#Perfect. Do you realize how hard it is to find an Ivory 0-10v dimming switch lol. Not only that, one that doesn't make the lights flicker. This is the holly grail of dimmer switches as far as I'm concerned. You can even switch the color out for 3 different types. I installed 6 of these recently, all working to perfection. Very solid dimmer switch, for an outrageously good price compared to the competitors. This is why I went with this choice, so hopefully they continue to keep with the competitive price point. It looks great up on the wall, and doesn't look cheaply made at all. Huge thanks coming from me, saved me from spending an arm and a leg finding an Ivory alternative. 10/10 from me.\n14#I missing Original Eaton USA made. I am angry with the purchase, I bought the product thinking it was made in North America, it is Eaton !!!, but it is just another Chinese garbage, what a purchase fraud, Amazon must include by obligation the country of origin of the article. I am very upset, I bought a Chinese garbage without knowing it. I do not recommend it.\n15#Full brightness setting provided much less than full light output. I purchased two of the dimmers. One was for use with a Mean Well PWM-120-24 24V 5A 120W PWM output LED power supply and LED strip. The other dimmer was for use with a LED Panel Light. In both cases, the light output of the LED's was much less than without the 10V dimmer wires connected. With a full bright setting, the LED's provided much less than full brightness.\n16#Need to have a separate low voltage line in order to have dimmer function. Works as advertised.\n17#Worked great for my UFO style warehouse LED's. Fantastic switch and looks great! has the gain switch behind the plate as well as one that can be used with the plate installed for maximum or minimum brightness. Works great with 4 lights strung in series.\n18#Wiring details explained: This has two sets of wires. One pair of wires connects to your dimmer pack where it says 0 to 10 V. Separately, this has two or three wires to serve as a regular single pole or three-way switch. (if you use it as a single pole, you don’t use one of the three wires). So to recap, this is a switch plus a dimmer controller in one container. Their best basically separate things. So you will need one set of wires going to the lights with power, and another set for the 0 to 10 V controls. This does not work for systems that do not have 0 to 10 V controls. For example if you buy an LED light fixture that says it is dimmable, and you buy a dimmer that says it’s good for LED lights, that will work with a two wire system. This is not that. If you don’t have a 0 to 10 V dimmer connection on your dimmer pack, don’t buy this.\n19#Good value like all three color faceplates included. We weren't sure if we wanted white, almond, or ivory, so Eaton included all three. Nice sales feature. These dimmer units are a little deeper than a conventional switch, so make sure you have enough room for it in your box, and a path to route the violet and purple (0-10 vdc) wires up to your dimmable LED fixtures. Works great.\n20#Didn't get much dimming range. Dimming trim setting was confusing. 0-10V = commercial tech w/ 120V and 0-10V wiring required (and separation of control/power wires) -- this (and 0-10V dimming fixtures) are probably not appropriate for DIY. We should start to see the 0-10V features replaced by bluetooth or zigbee for DIY applications (I can only hope). I didn't get very good low end (dimmed) on the dimming range from this dimmer. Could be I was viewing my outdoor LED flood light in bright daylight and that affected my perception, but I also didn't like the confusing logic-control interface for setting the dimmer trim to the particular fixture. With the dimming range already close to the limits of perceptibility, setting trim using this model's logic approach I was never satisfied I had achieved the maximum dimming range available from the product (conventional 120V LED dimmers typically include a physical dial trim to adjust the dimmer to a particular fixture; this one uses the master dimmer slide to somehow perform a logic adjustment to match the dimmer -- an extra layer of uncertainty between programmer and end result that makes all the difference (in a bad way).\n21#As advertised. I have purchased these several times. Cost effective and works as advertised.\n22#Good quality. Great quality product, recommend, order wrong one at first and i didnt return it time, they honored return\n23#Nice dimmer. This is a great dimmer for 0-12v dimming systems. I used it with 8 flat panel 2x4 LED fixtures and it works very well.\n24#Works good. Liked the different colors you could use depending on your needs. That said, I would have preferred having 3 options with cover plate than 3 switches to chang out. The dial to determine level of brightness is nice, but I don't like having to remove cover to dial up or down.\n25#Well worth it. Good price for these switches after looking at many sources. They worked great to dim the 2x4 LED panels that drop into suspended ceiling grid work. Easy install. Good instructions.\n26#Over paying for what you realy need. Everything worked great the only issue I have is all I needed was the cover plate and in order to get the color I needed I had to buy the set,\n27#Good 0-10v dimmer, have used with many of our lights. we selol 0-10 v light and have used a lot of dimmers. This works fine, less features, but lower price.\n28#Did not turn off. I wired it just like the picture showed, it makes the light bright and dim but will not turn the light off.\n29#Couldn't find the proper dimmer at big box store. Installed dimmable LED flat panel lighting..... dimmer required was not available where I bought the lights.... found this compatable dimmer....... works like a charm; very simple wiring......\n30#Sturdy with quality wiring. very well made. No idea what to do with the extra color plates.\n31#Five Stars. GREAT, NO PROBLEMS!\n32#Five Stars. Worked very well very happy easy installations buy again\n33#Four Stars. Works perfect with the light I purchased\n34#These worked fine gor me. These worked fine for me, I installed two, each controlling four 52w Hypericon LED troffers. I did't use the color change feature. Understand that these control the 0-10v DC dimming signal for dimmable LED drivers and dimmable fluorescent ballasts. These dimmers only switch but don't reduce the 110 VAC power.\n35#Five Stars. Excellent all the way around. Great for 0-10VDC control of LED lights. Arrived super fast\n36#Four Stars. Works as advertised.\n37#Great switch. Easy to hookup clear istructions. Great product\n38#Five Stars. Very good price and short delivery time.",
