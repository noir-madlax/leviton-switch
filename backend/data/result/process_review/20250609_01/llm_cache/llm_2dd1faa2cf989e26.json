Buy these. Worked as expected, homeowners were happy\n2#Easy install, works with standard switch cover. Installation instructions were clear. Switch fit with standard switch cover. Quick install that worked and looks good.\n3#Reliable, quality product; great installation instructions. High quality product, and great instructions. They offer a number of video and step by step installation guides that are really helpful. Solid product at a fair price for the high quality and reliability.\n4#Works well. Good value for the money. I changed out an old dimmer and purchased this one due to it being compatible with LED bulbs.\n5#Worked well, but did not last very long. Worked well for almost 2 years. This was accurately-described as suitable for LED lights and I appreciated the way this handled my LED application (no flicker and nice dimmability) It was straightforward to install and I would give it 5 stars if it lasted more than 2 years. But that feels too short a lifespan to warrant more than 3 stars. Upon swapping, I did not notice any visible failure or bad odorâ€¦it simply lost continuity between the terminals.\n6#Works, but with a delay in turning on LED lamps. I installed this dimmer switch to control 7 ceiling LED lighting fixtures retrofitted for the 6 inch recessed cans that had held HD40 halogen floodlights. Dimming is smooth and thereâ€™s no blinking, but there is a decided lapse between throwing the switch and light. Iâ€™ve tested a single lamp with a simple on-off switch and there is no delay. I canâ€™t test 7 lamps in parallel, but I suspect that the delay is due to the dimmer switch itself and not to the number being turned on.\n7#works without neutral wire. you're paying for quality & reputation of Lutron. if you have a home (or old wiring) built before the 80s, you probably don't have a neutral wire in your light switch box. I can confirm this switch works fine without a neutral wire and since the entire box is metal and grounded, we didn't have to connect the green ground wire either. It was as simple as connecting the two black wires on the previous switch and pushing them into this new dimmer switch (it also has screws but this is easier) I just bought the first dimmer switch that came along and see that you're pretty much paying 2x for the Lutron brand (compared to Chinese knockoffs) and that they are pretty much king of the dimmer business. If I had to do it again, I might have opted for a rotary switch but they look pretty wide in the photo - even this switch barely fit next to our existing switches (this is something to look into - open up your switch box first and see how much clearance you have on each side esp if you have 3 super skinny type switches like we did!) at end end of the day, it was easy to install, it works and have peace of mind it is going to be reliable and backed up by a reputable company!\n8#Bad quality switch. Faulty switch did not work as expected. Do not recommend purchase.\n9#Works great with LED ceiling lights in my kitchen. Great quality!!\n10#Light switch. Outstandingâ€¦!!\n11#Works Well, Dims Smoothly. Used this in a kitchen with six LED pucks and works as it should; smooth dimming and no flickering. Wished two could be used in a three-way but works with only one in the circuit. If you're not in a rental, the Kasa switches and dimmers are a better solution including being able to dim from any of the dimmers in a three-way circuit.\n12#Defective. One dims a little The other one doesnâ€™t work ðŸ¤”\n13#This dimmer will work correctly with these dimmable LED lights. I purchased this dimmer switch to wire up some LED lights for our headboard furniture in the bedroom to replace the old incandescent lighting which would not support screw in LED lights. Specifically, the new lights are here on Amazon. zouzai 6 Pack 4 Inch 5CCT Ultra-Thin LED Recessed Ceiling Light with Junction Box. I found a helpful instructional video on YouTube that showed me how to wire it, and I also had some questions for Lutron customer service, which was an outstanding experience for me as a DIY enthusiast.\n14#Easy to Install. This product was came with everything needed to make for an easy installation, even on a three-way switching circuit, and works exactly as advertised.\n15#May not work in a building only 30 years old, flicker and power drop is an issue. Pretty much wothless, to me, and is being returned. I am stuck with a LED fixture in my apt that isn't high quality, so I was hoping the dimmer would compensate. I found a cheap dial dimmer that worked better than this one because of flicker. Also the apartment experiences a brief drop in when the A/C kicks in and as a result, instead of compenstaing for this micro second drop, it turns off.\n16#Works just as designed with LED bulbs that are also dimmer rated. I've used this in an overhead kitchen fixture, and in a bathroom fixture where I wanted to be able to dim the main lights at night, and it works well. They have added a QR code to watch an install video to make sure you can wire it in. You should have basic electrical skills before doing this; if you do not have such skills, I would strongly recommend you search out some youtube videos on household wiring and installing switches prior to purchasing this. There is also a small blue adjustment range toggle to adjust the \"range\" of dimming on the main face of the switch. Be sure to use this prior to putting a faceplate back on the switch to see the trigger point where your LED bulbs will activate; some don't come on if the voltage is too low. Also, if dimming LED bulbs, be sure they are \"dimmer rated\", or you could have negative effects like visible strobing or overheating. If you are unsure if the bulbs are dimmer rated, then perhaps consider getting new ones that you know are, and moving the old bulbs to a fixture that will never use a dimmer.\n17#lights do flicker. The led lights do flicker with this switch when put in low to medium dim. Wires are connected according to the directions. Will be returning!\n18#Let the lights dim! Worked great with my led lighting. Looks like the original toggle and was the best price I could find for the same item. No delay during adjustments should last for many years. No neutral needed.\n19#Would buy again. Works great and can really dim the LEDS. The adjuster is clutch.\n20#Great Dimmer Switch. Excellent quality dimmer switch works perfectly!\n21#Great product! Works as advertised. Relatively easy to install. With led lighting, the illumination level is pretty linear from zero to max.\n22#Easy Install. Works well. Easy to set up. If you've done any electric work before this is straightforward. Just like any other switch. Lutron is a high end brand so it is more expensive but you get what you pay for. Quick install and no issues.\n23#Used supplies. Zero stars.. waited a month before opening the box.. all returned and used.. three out of three do not work. Hopefully amazon will help and not sell used electric equipment after my return date.. FYI I did go to a big box store and bought one new one.. it did work... I don't want to install upside-down..\n24#Good quality switch. Good quality, easy to install. Functions perfectly.\n25#Works great. Works perfectly, no buzzing, wide dimming range and I love the precision adjustment it allows for the lower dimming range. It was easy to install and just works. I also like that it fits in the existing cover and is not obtrusive. If I need another, I'll get one of these. If you have difficulty with small switches though, it's not for you. Ex. I wouldn't get these for someone with arthritis. The sliding switch is small and probably would be hard for them if they had to move it a lot.\n26#Exactly what I needed. This turned a normal switch into a dimmer, which worked well for having more than one switch on a wall plate.\n27#Fail. This switch is mis aligned in that to turn the light on, you push the switch down. To turn it off, you push the switch up. Thatâ€™s opposite of any other light switch Iâ€™ve found. I rotated the entire switch upside down but now the dimmer is opposite of what I want. Defective or poorly designed.\n28#Great dimmer, has come along way since LEDs were first introduced. Thanks Lutron. Just bought 2 of these dimmers, 1 for a new dining light, and the other for a brass chandelier we use for a 24/7night light. Sometimes with LED bulbs, especially low wattage, the brass fixture has .5w bulbs, 6 of them, the bulbs will flicker when you dim them down, but Lutron has perfected there dimmers much better now for LED bulbs, plus getting the right quality of bulbs helps as well. Both dimmers are working fantastic, well worth the $20 or so they cost. it is great to be able to dim the dining light when you want a much more comforting and romantic evening, especially without a strobe show from the bulbs flickering.\n29#It works sometimes. First, no printed directions. Had to go online- really? Second, the light flickers at all dimness levels at times, while adjacent lights are fine. And, yes, itâ€™s installed correctly. But beyond the return window. So, go to a big box where you have 90 days.\n30#Install upside down. Install upside down\n31#Broke at 3 years. Worked well but stopped working completely at 3 years.\n32#A good buy and works well. The switch was easy to install and feels and looks pretty sturdy. This is the first time I've bought this style of dimmer and I'm happy with how well it works. I especially like the ability to adjust the low end dimming so the lowest setting still allows for a slight glow from my LED dimmable bulbs. There is no flicker at the lowest setting - it functions extremely well. It has been very consistent with the dimming levels each time I turn it on. It's a good switch and worth the price.\n33#Poor quality control. Product was used, wires were left broken in the areas you push wires in. The dimmer function does not work. Past my return window. Will buy at a local store next time.\n34#noice. works great with the bigarse 2x2 LED i put in my office. easy to install / went in like it should. i guess time will tell longevity.\n35#Fits perfectly and works like a charm. Very simple installation and fits perfectly with my existing switch plate. Iâ€™m not sure why some people are complaining about the dimmer switch as if they werenâ€™t expecting it to be as small as it is. This was my main concern before buying because my hands and fingers are fairly large. But as you can see in the video, I can work it just fine. The build quality and look and feel of the switch is about what youâ€™d expect for $20. Dimming speed is as fast as you move it and the brightness will go to the max of your bulbs. Very happy with this purchase and will buy another one in the near future.\n36#Not for the US Market? Not sure what geographic market this is for, but it's not the US. Installed with the \"UP\" marking at the top, down is on and up is off. Very weird. Otherwise, it works fine. Maybe I should have bought it at the hardware store.\n37#Perfect! Easy to install! Excellent product! Easy to install on one gang switch. Instructions from the scan code are awesome and very clear.\n38#wiring connecting hint, working upside down. I bought this switch and it works just great. This is a 3 way switch application switch. It will work for a standard single switch application. As several reviews have had problems with the switch seeming to only function with the switch mounted upside down. There is a fix for that problem. For a single switch application, The solution is to properly connect the 2 wires. With the switch oriented in the up position. The power wire coming in is connected to the side of the switch with one screw. Being a 3 way design switch there are 2 output contact screws. Connect the wire going to the light fixture to the lower screw on the side with 2 screws. So if you find your having trouble with the switch functioning like it is upside down switch the wire to the light fixture to the other screw on the switch.\n39#Great dimmer. It works! Good dimmer.\n40#Nice design. Added to new lighting for family room. Option works well and suited my need. Like the idea that function is all in one.\n41#Dimming the lights...Yeah. Replaced an existing switch. Easy to install, works as advertised, can't ask for more.\n42#work great. quick ship works excelllent easy to install. great purchase\n43#Follow the installation directions! This dimmer worked fine. Some reviewers complained that it worked upside down, i.e., that the \"on\" position of the switch was down instead of up. They didn't follow the directions. They probably attached both electric wires to the same side of the switch. For a standard hook-up, not a 3-way, you are supposed to attach one electric wire to each side of the switch. Also, don't forget to adjust the little dimmer adjustment screw on the face of the switch. One morning the switch mysteriously stopped working. I eventually figured out that it was because I hadn't adjusted the screw when I installed the switch. I turned the screw clockwise a little bit and now everything is fine. Finally, note that there are some kinds of lights that the dimmer wonâ€™t work with. The dimmer did not work well with my integrated LED light. It worked well on my other lights.\n44#junk. did not work on florescent lights\n45#The dimmer and the switch are both great!! This was easy to wire and setup using the instructions and following along with a YouTube video. The app and compatibility have worked flawlessly on their own and with Alexa!\n46#Great dimmer. These dimmers are good for single and 3 way. They do not have that delay some other brands do. They also donâ€™t make the lights make any buzzing noises when they dim. Good dimmer.\n47#Causes flickering. The new led lights do flicker with this switch. Wires are connected according to the directions. Not sure why but they do flicker specifically in any position other than high or low position.\n48#Bought 2 one came used. FYI One of the two the vendor shipped was used. No wire nut or instructions, It had a piece of the previous owner's wire in the box. Box was not wrapped like the other one. Needed it so I used it and it works.\n49#Great product! Works well. Great switch",
