After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the LED Optimized Dimmer Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The LED Optimized Dimmer Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment. Include all mentioned reasons, or \"?\" if none can be inferred. <USE_REASON> and <USE> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- <PHYSICAL>/<PERF> and <DETAIL> MUST NOT include:\n  * Generic statements without details (e.g., \"good\", \"bad quality\")\n  * Issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., \"fast shipping\", \"delivery time\")\n- If a review mentions any physical aspect, related performance, or use together, extract them as separate entries under \"phy,\" \"perf,\" and \"use,\" with no overlap.\n- Make sure each <DETAIL> is under the most relevant <PHYSICAL> or <PERF> in the context of LED Optimized Dimmer Switches\n- Preserve negations\n\nKey Instructions:\n- Break down reviews with multiple aspects, performances, or uses into individual entries.\n- Escape special characters with backslash that could cause JSON syntax errors.\n- Include only explicitly mentioned reasons, and use \"?\" where no reason is mentioned.\n\nFinal Checklist:\n- Go through all reviews and ensure that no aspect, performance, use, or reason is omitted, even if only mentioned once.\n- Review all entries to ensure proper separation between aspects, performances, and uses.\n\nPrint the JSON result only.\nInput format:\n<ID>#<review>\n\n[[INPUT]]\n0#Buyers beware. Be careful this is not compatible with high quality lights or some of satco brand.\n1#30% Failure Rate. I purchased a total of 13 of these switches. Three were defective & not functional right out of the box & a fourth switch is now only intermittently functional & will have to be replaced.\n2#Strong, Sturdy and Beautiful Looking Dimmers. These dimmer switches are sturdy and works great for all my rooms. I have done a major renovation in my home and replaced lot of switches with these dimmer switches and boy, what a difference these make. Love them. I do hear mild buzzing sound from a couple of dimmers but this could be because of overload.\n3#Poor dimmers. Most off the dimmers did not work.\n4#Dimmer. I have used these dimmers on multiple projects now I have had no issues with them and my customer seemed to love them!!\n5#Cheap and functional. Cheap and fuctional. Much cheaper than local stores’ products. And they are functional, no complaints.\n6#Looks great and well built. Decent quality for the price - definitely better than a lot of the non me stuff you can find on Amazon. The face plates that come with them are nice and I like the fact that they have a whole range of outlets switches and dimmers so we can have a consistent look as we update our old house.\n7#As described. Enjoyed the price and the quantity… Perfect fit for what I needed!\n8#Worth it, not some cheap low quality switch. Wasn't sure at first if these were cheap and would crap out fast. So far so good, have had them in for over a month now no issues. I like the light showing power, especially on a three-way switch.\n9#Good dimmers. Bought new dimmers for my entire home. Overall these are really nice and aesthetic. They work really well. Easy to install. A few of the dimmers do flicker which can be frustrating to resolve but over all it's a great buy.\n10#Low quality product. Lights flicker on these dimmers. I installed it on led tape, regular light fixtures and cans. Always same result: flickering when dimmed.",
