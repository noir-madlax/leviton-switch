Very easy install, less than 15 minutes total, and it works perfectly.\n1#Sold me used crap ! Bought two of these dimmers, and one of them was used, and did not work !\n2#Didn't work to keep LED bulbs from flickering. Sorry to say these are not compatabil with high quality wifi color LEDs .\n3#As described. Very satisfied with this product\n4#Dimmer flicker! When activated the lights flicker üòû\n5#Good priced dimmer. Dimmer comes with dimmer plate as well. Ivory though is almond and almond is really ivory. So if you want almond...order the ivory. Has nice adjustment on it. Good instructions for 2 wire or three wire installation. Only odd thing thing is it did not come with plate screws.\n6#Good Value Switch - poor color match. Received two switches, one ivory and one almond colors. Both of them work well, but neither matches the ivory and almond existing switches. Installed as singles, they would not be as noticeable, but in a two or three switch setup, the color difference is very apparent,\n7#Dimmer switch sticks in the left position. After I installed this switch, I discovered that the dimmer slider sticks on the left (low) side and it is difficult to get it to move right. I uninstalled it and wanted to return it but I was passed the return date which is my fault because I was ordering a bundle of things that I knew I would need for my kitchen renovation but did not get to the installation until it was after the date. Yes, my fault but nevertheless, it is disturbing since now I have paid for a low quality switch that I will likely never use. Be sure if you order this part that you check it thoroughly right away so you don't get stuck.\n8#Easy use. Clear directions and easy to install with all the wireless connectors needed to complete the job\n9#Smooth dimming, no RFI, fits w/GFI. This dimmer is awesome! It even fits next to a GFI outlet in a two gang box. More importantly, it dims my bulbs (both LED and originally Incandescent) smoothly down to nothing. There is a little low limit adjustment wheel before you put the plate back on that allows you to set the lowest level. In essence, a custom range. Also, I tested for Radio Frequency Interference. I put an AM radio right next to it to hear the buzzing, but 18‚Äù away it was clear. Perfect.\n10#Well made dimmer. Looks good, well made, easy to install and works great.\n11#Price Easy Install. Need dimmer switch wanted simple dimmer found this switch ordered, straight forward install happy with purchase\n12#Nice! It doesn't cause the LED lights to flicker. Quality. No flicker in LED lights. Seperate brigtness level selection control. Bought two. Not sorry at all.\n13#Does not work with All Light Bulbs. Purchased this Dimmer switch to work with GE LED BR30 Dimmerable 19Watt Flood Lights I have in my Kitchen. When you turn the slider to a dimmer position (perhaps 30 to 35% Brightness) ...next time you turn on lights they will not come on. You must slide the dimmer to a Higher setting. So if you want to be able to use a Constant brightness setting....be aware...at least with my Well Known GE LED BR30....this dimmer switch may not turn on lights...you will need to keep its brightness at a Higher setting. I did use the Adjusting wheel to set up the Switch with the Lights...that did not resolve the issue.\n14#Goeed quality. Good quality easy to install.\n15#Easy to install. Very nice switch. Easy to install. Works perfectly\n16#Absolute CRAP - a waste of diesel shipping from China. LED's buzz when ON & flicker when dimmed. These \"dimmers\" are absolute CRAP! Regular 120v AC LED bulbs flicker when dimmed and BUZZZZZZZ when fully powered. Not worth the pollution shipping them from China. Like others ... I'd give these dimmers a MINUS five star rating if I could.\n17#Rocker switch mechanism is poorly designed, it failed with very little use. A small ball with spring which allows the toggling of the metal contactor rocker ON/OFF comes loose with normal use and defeats the normal ON/OFF function of the switch. I would not have another rocker switch from this manufacturer it is a waste of money.\n18#No flickering here. Installed it and worked great, I'm wondering if people that are having flickering issues are using an led that isn't made to be dimmable.\n19#Flickering lights. You get what you pay for. This switch looks good, was easy to install and I like the sliding dimmer switch. After installing this switch our light fixture flickers randomly throughout the day; and yes, it is installed properly. We will be returning this one and purchase one from our local hardware store.\n20#Not so simple. As an electrical worker with 50 + years in the trade the instructions were easy to understand. I don't recommend persons with NO electrical background to attempt to install this unit. First the instructions DO NOT cover all the different ways a 3-Way or a Single pole switch can be wired up. Example, older home single pole switches can have only one Black and one White wire in the box. In this case the white wire is used as a Hot (power) lead supplying power to the switch. In this case there is NO neutral wire in the box. 3-Way switches are even more complicated with travelers and multiple of ways to configure each switch not explained in the instructions. Each wire whether White, Black or Red must be identified, Power, Line, Load, Traveler or neutral before making your connections. As a reminder Most CFLs and many LED lights are NOT dimmable so check first.\n21#Made our led bulbs strobe. Made our led bulbs strobe\n22#Worked as expected. Easy install and good quality\n23#Flicker. Ordered two of these dimmers and once installed to control my LED bulbs, both flicker. No amount of adjustment to the dimming wheel eliminates the flickering. Only position where I do not get flickering is full on position. Very disappointed after reading some stellar reviews. Would have returned but the \"return window is closed\". Made in CHINA. Re ordered Lutrons but they are in transit. Will report if the Lutrons prevent flicker. I have every reason to believe they will be flicker free because they are an established brand. Not recommended.\n24#Looks good, not very led friendly or full dim. Brightness is not a good catagory for a dimmer switch. The better catagory would be variability. The leds they were hooked to only dim about 2/3 before shutting off. The 2nd adjustment helps some. The worst part is it causes the leds to buz in the 3k hertz down to 1k htz with the dim. Can lights are less effected than the led bulbs that screw in. Couldnt use dimmer on those even though they are dimmer rated.\n25#Wall switch. Good quality good price\n26#As expected. Works as expected, seems to be of good quality\n27#Light Dims at Bright Setting. The dimmer cuts out on the bright end (as you increase the brightness, it all of a sudden goes dim when its hour be at its brightest).\n28#Works great... Got today.. already installed and works great!\n29#Excellent on time and as advertised. Excellent !\n30#great! i liked the instructions very clear ,easy to understand. works perfectly .\n31#Great Replacement Switch for LED can light. Works well, easy to install. I like the adjustable minimum brightness setting!\n32#Best Value for Money. Purchased in both white and Ivory. Updating my house before selling. Complete light adjustment easily done. Size with wires easily fit in connection box. Horizontal light intensity slide extremely convenient. Price OUTSTANDINGLY LOWER than any others I could locate. Will purchase again if price stays about the same.\n33#Dims large range smoothly. Fixed my issue of flickering LEDs with an improper other dimmer. Good quality and nice to have slider separate.\n34#Light does not come on when dimmed. We had to replace our dimmer switch for our bathroom. This switch seemed sturdier than our previous one so was very happy until we tried dimming our light for night time use. Whenever we dimmed our light to where we wanted it the light would not turn on. You could verily dim the light for it to turn on and off at that exposure which defeated the purpose of having the dimmer in the first place because it was still too bright.\n35#Easy. Easy to install and the fine tuning adjustment on top of the brightness adjustment is great.\n36#LED's.... maybe not. I installed this device on LED lamps. Not sure why, but it had limited range in dimming. It also did not adjust to full brightness. I tried another brand and got similar results.",
