Many homes in our area are being built with this type of electrical system. This switch, dimmers and outlets are the simplest to replace. It is literally plug and play. No locating and opening the breaker, no wiring to mess with. All is needed is to remove the faceplate, unclip the switch, pop it out, then replace with replacement. I replaced a light switch with a dimmer switch in less than a minute. Downside is, they're a little more expensive than the standard switches, are not available at your local hardware store yet and are not compatible with standard switches.\n1#Simply reliable! Simple installation and use. Reliable.\n2#Got a nice deal. I was looking for this dimmer on Deako website and it was costing me way more than what Amazon was offering. Came in new packaging and I installed it in 2 mins. Plug and play.\n3#Amazing! It takes 2 seconds to put in like all other deako switches. If you like the others, youll love this too!\n4#Anyone can install these amazing switches. I love the Deako switches, but you have to be “wired” for them…..we have a Horton Smart home, new construction.. It takes less than five minutes to replace regular switches with these amazing dimmers….no tools required\n5#Lights blink on and off with this dimmer. Our lights just blinked on and off on all the switches we used this dimmer on. We ended up removing all of them.\n6#Worked Perfectly the First Time / Easy to Install. Worth the money! Easy to install in minutes and worked perfectly the very first time. Definitely would recommend this product.\n7#Works as advertised. Package arrived on date as stated. The switches are easy to install. The price per switch is high.\n8#Buzzing sound. Buzzing noise when on. Wouldn't recommend\n9#Game changer. This has made this extremely bright lights so much easier on the eyes! Definitely a must!\n10#This is perfect! Easy to install, like magic, one, two, three\n11#Super expensive for what it is. I'm thinking about removing all these overpriced Deako switches that came on my home and use something else. You need to lower your prices, if it was cheaper I would have updated all my switches to smart ones. But there is no way I'd do it at this price point. These are not even nice at this price. The switches are very loud. You'll wake the whole household in the morning pressing one of these switches. On another note, the Wi-Fi smart switches get hot.\n12#Perfect! My new house came with regular Deako switches and I have changed out several with the dimmer. They are very easy to change and I love that I can now adjust the brightness of the lights.\n13#Nice Dimmer. We bought several of these dimmers. They were easy to install and work well.\n14#Almost Returned it until….. It arrived. I installed. It did not dim all the way down. I decided to read the instructions on the Amazon description. Voila, there is an adjustment wheel at the bottom that you adjust for the lowest dim level.\n15#Works great. Perfect for all areas! If you Hate turning on the \"big\" light, maybe you just need a dimmer switch!\n16#Smooth Control, Simple Setup – Deako Lighting Dimmer Switch.

It’s a great choice if you’re looking to adjust the brightness with ease while maintaining a modern look in your home!\n17#Love these!! Very clever and multi-function smart switch indeed. Not only are they sleek in appearance, but the dimmer feature brings a calming ambience effect into both my spacious living room and master bedroom!\n18#Not working after a couple years. This thing is really expensive to only work for 2 years. When I flip it on now it only turns the light on if you push it hard and fast, otherwise the light doesn't come on. It's lacking in quality for sure.\n19#ease of installation. very simple to install and use great product\n20#Inconsistent Switching. The purpose of a switch is to switch, and unfortunately this one doesn’t do it well. We may simply have a bad unit, but when we switch it on we must press HARD to ensure it turns on. This is independent of deako receptacle since we’ve tried it on more than one. It is a switch issue.\n21#Greta product. Like all daeko product , a little bit in the high side in price but so practical. Allow you to dim all the lights connected to that switch if they are dimmable ( including dimmable LED) . Install in less than a minute if you have that type of receivers in your house and immediate effect .\n22#Works as expected. Works well and installs easily but only with Deacko setups.\n23#works as needed. we purchased a new build house with all Deako lighting. super easy replacement, dimmer works well.\n24#Great dimmer if you have the Deako system. These deako light switches are so easy to pop in and out. No need for an electrician when you want to change switches. You need to have that type of system already wired in your home.\n25#Trrrrrrrrrr that’s what you hear. Switch keeps making this stupid humming kind of noise when set to lower setting.. Trrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Very irritating.. overpriced item that doesn’t even work properly.. very disappointed\n26#Easy Install. Great product. Very easy to install. Just what we needed.\n27#Simple to Install. I bought this light switch for my dining room chandelier. I wanted the option to dim the light for ambiance. Super easy to install. Just pop out the old switch!\n28#Great switches- disappointing customer service. Be sure to check out the product immediately, and pursue a return immediately if product is broken. We recently purchased 3 switches. 2 were perfect and easy to install. Love them. Unfortunately the 3rd switch was damaged. After 3 separate customer service chats, we were informed this product only has a 30 day return window, that we missed by 1 day. We had been busy and didn’t get around to installing the switches the first month. We were told to attempt to pursue a warranty claim with the manufacturer for any kind of resolution - which is still pending.\n29#Easy. Easy to install and works great\n30#Expensive. DR Horton puts these type of switches in all their new homes in my area. I’m sure they have some kind of sweetheart deal with Deako. There’s nothing inherently wrong with the product. They are very easy to change and require no wiring. My complaint is simply the price for the product. Roughly 50 bucks for a dimmer switch is insanity. However, it did take me all of 30 seconds to change this out.\n31#dimmer. this light works great... just what we needed\n32#Can’t pull old switch out of housing. I am changing some switches out and I am unable to pull a couple of them out of the housing. Some came out easy. A couple impossibly. Not good.\n33#Easy to switch out. Nice product but a little pricey if you don't get them on sale. It's basically a plug n play switches that are easy to change with other Deako devices. House was already setup with this system.\n34#Easy to install. Love the ease of installation, now I can dim my lights!\n35#Love it. It’s great to walk into my closet, and the light turns on automatically\n36#Easy took just a couple minutes. Hard to be any easier. Works great, bit pricy\n37#Dimmer. Good price, works great.\n38#Dimmer Switch. Easy installation and use.\n39#Do not bother if you have multiple lights. I have a DR Horton home with all Deako switches. Kitchen has 4 ceiling lights controlled by 2 switches. Followed instructions carefully. After making the adjustment to avoid flickering, the dimming effect was minimal. Gone back to basic switch.\n40#dimmer switch. Works great for smart home switches. Not sure if they can be used for regular switches. more expensive than I expected but worth it\n41#Easy to install. As promised easy to install and works great\n42#Overpriced. It works like any other manual dimmer, it just costs 2x as much, however if your house was wired with Deaco switches it’s expensive to change out. This said to be fair the selling point of Deaco is the ability to switch out various switches easily. This is no exception, it took me longer to remove the switch plate than to replace the switch, super super easy. I’m just not sure it’s would be worth it for someone with rudimentary skills.\n43#Easy to install!! Easy to install! Just pop the old one out and pop this one in!\n44#Works as advertised. Easy to install works great\n45#OK product. Over all the switch worked well however it only lasted a little over a year before I started to have issues with it. The switch wouldn't turn very well after a year. As in I would have to forcibly put the switch in the on position multiple times before the light finally turned on. Very frustrating. I do love the brand though just not this particular switch. I ended up swapping it out for the mor experience version of this switch which in my opinion is worth it. I can control the new switch with my voice and ther are more dim setting. If you want a dimmer switch from this company just buy the more expensive one from the start.\n46#Dimmer switch. Works great 👍",
