I had a hallway with very bright lights, and the lighting sources (multi-LED discs) were mounted flat against the ceiling and looked a bit pesky to replace. So instead of getting lower-wattage discs I decided to just buy and install a dimmer switch, which was also cheaper. The installation instructions were straightforward, even for my three-way (a switch at either end of the hall) circuit. All the hookup was twist-on wire nuts. And because it came as a pair of switches (you only need one, even for a three-way circuit) I have a spare switch in case I need it elsewhere. I have just set the dimmer at the level I like and left it alone. It's just a tiny slider at the bottom of the switch paddle, and if you plan to adjust it a lot you might want to look for a different switch design.\n1#WARNING: will not dim all the way to off, or even near it! These seemed to be just what I wanted to replace a couple of light switches in my kitchen where bright light is great unless you want to tone it down a bit to set the mood for dinner. While these will do all that, they will not dim to off, even on a 30W incandescent bulb. That was a deal killer for me, so back they went. I ordered a GE that had a little dial allowing me to adjust exactly what the minimum setting would be, which worked out perfectly.\n2#Good Price for the quality. Good Quality for the price ! Fast shipping. Switch perfect for a house flip or rental property\n3#Not for LEDs! If you don’t have LED lights, it may be fine! Buy an LED specific dimmer if you have LED lights. Using this dimmer turns every room into a Halloween haunted house. Will have to buy better/$$ switches to replace these. These switches are also a very bright white compared to the switches and plates already in this new house.\n4#Muy bueno. Muy práctico y fácil instalación\n5#It's not the function of the switches, it's the design that's a problem. It's not the function of the switches, it's the design that's a problem. I have a 7 year old, and she complains that the \"slider\" dial to adjust the dimmer, is just too sharp when she touches the lights. I thought she was being dramatic, but the other night when I was going into the kitchen, I touched the light switch in the wrong place and it actually felt sharp. These switches aren't bad, they work just fine and are easy to install. But there are better designed dimmers out there.\n6#Easy to Install and Works Great! Installed both in under 30 minutes, no issues at all. The dimming is smooth, no flicker with my LED bulbs, and they look clean on the wall. Great value for a 2-pack. Would buy again.\n7#Nice Bright Switch Covers. These are a nice bright white color with an easy slide.\n8#Constant flickering. I'm pretty sure it's the dimmer switches but we get constant flickering from the lights the switches are hooked up to. I guess you get what you pay for\n9#Constant flickering. The dimmer switch looks nice and was easy to install but it flickers no matter how the sensitivity dial is adjusted. I’ve tried all different settings but there is always a spot on the dimmer slider at which the lights flicker constantly. Very disappointing. I haven’t tried the 2nd one yet to see if it’s the same, will update if not and hopefully I just got one that’s defective.\n10#Good quality. Quick shipping\n11#Not thrilled. Works but flickers and hums. If i could do it over again i would probably pass this one up.\n12#Great quality, will buy again. Ordered a 2-pack, received a 10-pack! Switches are great, I love the adjustment knob to control the min brightness, the fact it's in front rather than behind the unit makes it super easy to adjust the light. The adjustments worked perfectly. No flicker at all on the lights. The actual dimmer works great too, I feel like it gets stuck slightly on it's min position when trying to crank it back up though. eels great quality overall, and also includes a faceplate as well as the plastic tie off caps. Btw, If you do notice a flicker, it's most likely your bulbs.\n13#Perfect Upgrade for Modern Lighting. These dimmer switches are exactly what I needed to upgrade the ambiance in our home. The 2-pack was a great value, and installation was quick—even for someone who isn’t an electrician. The dimming range is smooth with no flickering, and it works perfectly with both LED and incandescent bulbs. I love the sleek, low-profile design—it looks clean and modern on the wall. Whether you want bright task lighting or a cozy evening vibe, these dimmers do the job. Highly recommend for anyone looking to add style and control to their lighting!\n14#Versatile dimmers for our bathrooms. We decided to spruce up our bathroom with new fixtures but didn't realize how much brighter they would be. These little guys came to the rescue. I love being able to dim the lights first thing in the morning and when I'm getting ready for bed. They didn't take long at all for my husband to install. Wish we would have done it sooner!\n15#Would not recommend. Wouldn't recommend. They work great for about 8mos to a year...the switch cracks/ breaks. After the first one broke, I thought it was a fluke, and bought another, but same thing within a years time. I'm moving on to another brand.\n16#Flickers. Product works, However, when lights are dimmed all the way they start to flicker until it turns off. Unable to return as I missed return policy. Better to spend more money for better quality.\n17#Basic dimmer with CFL or LED capabilities BUT below average for quality of plastic finish of switch! Basic dimmer switch with CFL or LED capabilities. The dimmer offers easy tree or four wire install for 3-way or single pole install. The dimmer itself is easy to wire and does work with dimmable LED bulbs. The only issue I encountered after the install of the first dimmer was that the plastic finish of the switch paddle and the switch plate cover is that if you are not very careful the finish will very easily scratch and/or discolor. After my install which I have done about 2500 in my life so far there were what appeared to be hairline dark marks on the paddle and the wall plate. The marks were so small but noticeable since the switch was white colored. I used a paper towel with some cleaner and rubbed the marks which did fad but if this happens while just doing the install and I was wearing Nitrile Disposable Gloves then I wonder how it will hold up under everyday use. I deducted a star due to the lack of quality to the switch plastic used!\n18#A good dimmer switch with kind of small size plate. The switch itself is good, the dimmer works smoothly. But the plate is too small! I have to buy a larger plate in local store otherwise I have to paint the small area that was covered by the original plate.\n19#They broke in half. Very disappointed 2 of them fully broke in the middle , And one of them won’t turn on at all….. I wouldn’t recommend it.\n20#Doesn't work. Cheap Chinese crap...dimmer would not dim LED down lights. Trying to replace an existing broken dimmer switch. Lights switch on but will not dim\n21#Do not buy. Do not buy, bad quality and the lights flicker on every setting other than fully lit\n22#Works great! Works great!\n23#Dimmer not very good. The BESTTEN dimmer works. However it dims my recessed ceiling lights about 30%. I would have returned it, but the return window expired. Basically, it’s useless. I’ll have to look for another dimmer!\n24#NFG. They did work. I used a known good led dimmer to make sure bulbs were dimmable and it worked fine. Bought 4 switches. And two did not work\n25#Don't buy!! Garbage, don't work. Don't waste your money.\n26#Broke. Broke after after 3 months, used maybe once a week.\n27#Does not work after several months.... Both of these worked initially with some flickering. After a several months, the dimmer doesn't work at all! Had to replace both of them. Stay away.\n28#DONT BUY! These are terrible! I read the reviews and ignored the warning “frequently returned item” but Im cheap and bought them anyway. They are as bad as the reviews.\n29#Great Product, if it Works. Very happy, everything you'd Expect. Smooth Installation & Operation, Adjustable, Aesthetic, Etc. The Problem; 1 of 2 of the switches worked flawlessly. The other cause's the light to flicker, 3 Stars.\n30#High quality. It’s just like description.\n31#Works ok, dimmer is not in a convinient location. The switch does what its supposed to just fine, but the dimmer slide button is either in a bad place, or is stands too prominent from the face of the switch because everytime someone turns the switch off their finger brushes the dimmer, slightly changing the brightness. I have this in a guest bathroom so if I dim the light when we have guests over, by the time they leave the brightness is back to 100%. I will probably have to switch it out with another brand. Otherwise it works fine\n32#Not for LED. Two switches in the box but neither would work on my LED lights. DID NOT WORK FOR LED AS ADVERTISED!!!\n33#Poor. Only came with one, and does not work at all. Installed it single pole an it doesn’t do a thing.\n34#Good Paddle Dimmer. This single pole or three way dimmer switch is simple to install and versatile. The instructions are clear and easy to understand. The dimmer controls light level and does not give the flickering or buzzing that older dimmers suffered. The color is as expected, bright white. The product feels light it is constructed with some durability and will fit your Decor receptacles. A friendly reminder: always take a picture of the existing wiring before you unwire it. Having this reference can save you a time and mental effort if you're a DIYer.\n35#Great design. Very well made and well designed. Easy install that works without issue. Highly recommended.\n36#Very easy to install. Good quality, good value for the price. Cheaper than my local home depot\n37#A little finicky. It’s a little finicky. If you turn the light on when it’s less than half way on the dimmer bar, you don’t get any light at all. You get what you pay for.\n38#Click on. Worked for 2 weeks and then failed. I don't want to risk installing the second one.\n39#Don't work. Can't get the flicker out of 1 and other didnt work at all. Junk\n40#Defective. Bought two, one failed after a month. Switch broke mechanically from normal use, not an electrical issue. Not returnable, will contact manufacturer.\n41#Flickers and broke. First one was broken out of box and wouldn’t turn on, second one just makes the light flicker. I just installed a dimmer bulb so I know it’s the switch. Don’t recommend\n42#Defective. The lights blink off and on when the slider is at the halfway position.\n43#Great dimmers. Simple installation. One is controlling six recessed LED fixtures in my kitchen ceiling and the other is controlling four recessed LED fixtures in my living room. They are working perfectly over the entire dimming range without any flicker. Ajusting the available fine tuning wheel was not necessary. I highly recommend them.\n44#Works great !! Easy install !! excellent dimming !! Works great !! Easy install !! excellent dimming !!\n45#Cheap. At the beginning looks hard to instal ,just looks it was easy to handle.\n46#One doa. One out of two was not working had to pay electrician for first install and the replacement they sent.\n47#Easy dimmer replacement. I am no electrician, directions were easy to follow, simple install and looks great.",
