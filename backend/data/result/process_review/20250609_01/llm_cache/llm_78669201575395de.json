After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Slide Control Dimmer Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Slide Control Dimmer Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment.

I ordered all my switch and outlet from them. It is bad quality.\n1#Poor performance, wont turn on unless on high dimmer. Dims, but if you turn off the switch and then try to turn it back on, it wont turn on unless your move the dimmer up. Likely poor voltage control. I adjusted the dimmer control and still doesnt work. Using on a 25W LED\n2#Good auality. God quality\n3#1 out of 2 worked. One worked fine. The other the dimmer didnâ€™t work but by the time we had an electrician put it up and noticed it did work it was 3 days past the 30 to return it.\n4#Bad switch. Professional installed one week after return date unfortunately it doesnâ€™t work. Itâ€™s wired correctly. Put a different dimmer on and works fine. No recourse because of the return window ðŸ˜•\n5#Quality. I guess you get what you pay for. Iâ€™d spend a little more to get a better product.\n6#Works well! Installed these in both a 3-way and as a single pole. The size is pretty typical of larger dimmer switches, that can be tight in boxes but normal. They work reliable for a couple of weeks now. The cover plate is a bit odd as it is made to snap on without any screws showing. This is fine if they are used in a single gang box but maybe not if you want the screw free look in a 2 gang or larger box. The one little issue we noticed is the dimmer is somewhat limited in the dimmer function of around 25% at the lowest setting.\n7#It fits but barely. Iâ€™m trying to slowly convert all the light switches in my house to the paddle type. I think that these look nicer and more modern. I like the wall plates that donâ€™t show the screws. Its nice that they included them. You only need to connect 4 wires. I didnâ€™t use the yellow wire nuts that came with it because it was too big to fit in the box. I had to use smaller ones. The back of this switch is big and with all the wires it was hard to fit everything in. It does work, though.",
