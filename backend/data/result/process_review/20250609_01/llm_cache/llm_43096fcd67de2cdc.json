Still havenâ€™t figured out how to make it work. The lights light up like the instructions say it should but the dang thing wonâ€™t make the light come on then off. Waste of time and money!!\n1#Does not work. Didn't work at all\n2#Works for what I need. For 10 years, I joked with my husband that I wanted a clapper. He finally caved and I love it lol even with it's quirks... it takes some practice to get the rhythm and tone of your claps right to work it, but still better than having to get out of bed! Unfortunately, it does register perfectly timed coughs and will turn on/off unexpectedly. It doesn't work for items that have to be turned on/off with buttons like an oscillating fan.\n3#Item was INCONSISTANT--Was Returned. Gave it a try but wasn't satisfied with this item. It Didn't always work and I had trouble with the TV that was plugged into the same socket after using the Clapper.\n4#The Clspper. The clapper is garbage! They donâ€™t work and go off when my tv is playing. The clapper is a waste of money and they do not work! Do not buy!\n5#Clap on! Clap off! It's the clapper!\n6#Wish I could give it 5 stars. The classic clapper of the old as seen on TV. Wish I could give it 5 stars based on memories. Itâ€™s really hit and miss. Sometimes a good strong clap turns it on, others it takes about 6 double claps. Definitely do not think it is worth what they charge. It seems to wait to turn on until you get to the point of frustration.\n7#Straight garbage. Doesnâ€™t work at all. Following the instructions to a T. Iâ€™ve done IT help desk Iâ€™m young and not stupid this thing verifiably does not work for a lamp itâ€™s effectively an active kill switch for whatever you plug into it and doesnâ€™t turn it on no matter if 3 claps are detected. Garbage.\n8#This thing is awesome. This thing is awesome. Easy to connect, works great. The small size helps it blend in so itâ€™s not tacky looking. Picks up clapping noise easily. Better than a remote\n9#Stopped working. Used for 20 mins and then it stopped working has not come on again returning\n10#Works great. Easy to install. Works great. Wish I had ordered it sooner.\n11#very useful for an elderly person. Be sure and put it in open place not hidden alongside furniture\n12#It's honestly garbage. It should be a useful product but instead it's just a novelty. If the patent were available, someone else would have made this into a much better product. Instead, it's finicky and does not detect noises well, especially when it's near furniture. I do not mean behind furniture, I just mean near it. It really does not work well.\n13#Fantastic. It's awesome. Works perfectly. Very happy with the product.\n14#Barely worrks. This thing is a hunk of crap\n15#It's meh. This thing is temperamental. Sometimes it comes on, sometimes it doesn't and then odd things like closing a drawer or a knock on a wall or door will turn it on or off. Not a big fan.\n16#Not totally reliable on first attempts! Sometimes the device requires multiple claps to make it work!\n17#Clapper is junk. Doesnâ€™t work\n18#Meh. I would not register my elderly mother-in-lawâ€™s clap, and all I did was confuse her and frustrate her. Good idea for a product though if onlyit would work.\n19#Not as expected. Doesnt exactly work as advertised. Maybe it works after numerous tries\n20#Great. bought for mom in assisted living. works well\n21#Funtion. Never worked i returned\n22#It worksâ€¦mostly. Have to clap loudly and slowly. Turns on when I open the end table drawer. But it does work.\n23#Couldnâ€™t figure it out. I could not figure out how to use two plus. There might be something simple Iâ€™m missing but I couldnâ€™t figure it out so I returned it.\n24#Clap off stay off. Never worked\n25#Didn't work. It will not respond to clapping and it spontaneously turned on and off.\n26#difficult to get to clap the right speed and volume to get it to work. - Really old design, much better options out there - You must clap at the exact right speed and volume to get it to work - you'll end up clapping at this thing for multiple tries. It's super, super annoying - This product deeply needs an update. Dont Buy this.\n27#Clap on, clap off ðŸ¤£. We have two now. They work great. I will never be without one\n28#Very loud clap is needed. It is very hard to clap loud enough to turn on or off.\n29#Does not work. Waste of money. What a hunk of junk.\n30#Not reliable enough for me. Sadly, this is a great concept but it just didn't deliver. PROS: It has two outlets which is a great convenience. CONS: It doesn't take 3 prong plugs. Also, It only worked \"okay\" up close, with just the right timing between claps, and with a good, loud, clap, but that meant it only turned on and off 1 out of maybe every 3, 4 or 5 claps. It almost NEVER clapped on and right back off again, and when I put it in the location where I needed it (behind a console desk on opposite wall from the door with the only light strip in the room) it almost never clapped on or off unless I opened the door to the desk OR walked into the room and stood in front of it - which defeated the purpose because I had to navigate into a very dark library (with obstacles) to turn it on. Also had the pleasant experience of stinging hands more times than I care to count from trying to clap so hard and clear. I WILL note that my hubby had an easier time getting it to work (large man hands vs. definitely small woman hands?) but I can't sit around & wait for him to get home to turn the lights on and off! Bought remote control plugs instead and am a happy camper.\n31#It doesnâ€™t work. Itâ€™s doesnâ€™t work. I tried clapping super slow, regular and fast. Donâ€™t waste your money.\n32#Seriously don't buy. Clapped every way possible - doesn't work at all, not even once.\n33#Not good. Honestly, its not good..i bought it for the nostagia. If you want a usable clapper, get a cheaper chinese one. This one is frustratingly unreliable.\n34#Works great. Got this three years ago and recently bought another one. We us it on outside string lighting around deck and outside kitchen. We love them, big hit with grandsons, they love to clap them off and on.\n35#Helps old people get around. I love this thing I can't believe it's still out there being handicapped it's very hard to keep getting up and turning on and off the light this little Gizmo makes it easier\n36#Great Product with Useful Features â€“ Highly Recommended! I loved it! It works as expected, but I recommend reading the manual to avoid any frustrations. The second and third sockets function differently, and you can also adjust the noise sensitivity to high or low. Additionally, the \"away\" mode will trigger with any noise. Iâ€™ll be buying a second oneâ€”highly recommend!\n37#Don't buy this! Not happy with this. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes, it just randomly chooses to activate by just setting a phone on my table, and other times, it won't work even though I slap my hands as hard as possible. I should have returned it before it was too late...\n38#Doesn't work like it should.. I was about to write a bad review and return this thing. I was making a video on how it doesn't work and then out of no where it started to work ðŸ˜‚ Tip is you can't clap fast. It has to be one clap - pause- clap And it doesn't work if the TV is on... There has to be no noise for it to work .. so I might still return it..\n39#Wish it worked...but it doesn't. It doesn't work... There are two 'sensitivity' settings, but every time I try to use it, no matter the setting, it thinks it's picking up background noise and does not function. Only way I can get it to work (inconsistently) is if I'm right next to it, which completely defeats the purpose. Unfortunately was supposed to be a fun, nostalgic gift... but turned out to be a waste of money. I bought it as a Christmas present but life happened and we didn't actually try it until March, so definitely outside the return window.\n40#No good! Bummer none didn't work. Does not work for any stand lights\n41#Easy Light. Purchased the Clapper for a bedroom lamp. Just as described on line. Practice sound for off and on your ready to go. Would buy again. B.\n42#No clap on or off worked. Never worked from opening the packages and I purchased 2\n43#You got it here at lightning speed we really appreciate it. Thank you for getting this clapper to us so quickly we really miss my husbandâ€˜s got Parkinson and he really depends on that light by his table makes life so much easier. Thank you for delivering it so quickly.\n44#The crapper. They should call it the \"crapper\". It works ok for a few days but after a week we hurt our hands trying to stop it. I find now that during the day it turns itself on for no reason. What a great piece of technology. Not! I probably shouldn't have posted that because they will take the \"great piece of technology \" out of context.\n45#Sensitive trigger. Coughing turned light off and on. Unusable for chairbound woman with COPD\n46#Great Quality. it just works, I love it",
