These worked well for replacing an old double light switch. They're attractive and a good value. I haven't purchased many of this style of paddle switch, so not sure how the build quality matches up with other options out there. The plastic feels good, though a little lighter plastic on the paddles than I would have expected -- and the click sound when switching is a bit sharper (hollow sounding?) than I would prefer (though it makes a very secure click) -- Overall, the switches look and work great -- and seem to have good quality switching mechanisms.\n1#Works just as I expected, easy to install. I don’t know how to do handy things around the house, but this was really straightforward and easy enough for a total novice to change out. Now I want to change out the rest of the switches in my house.\n2#Quality. Pay a little more and get something of a better grade . This are a sure fire hazard\n3#Great switches! Simple elegant rocker switches. Not much you can say about a light switch other than they worked and simple to install. They fit perfectly!\n4#Loud! Switch works as described but switch has a loud click in on/off positions. If you are looking for a quiet switch this isn’t it.\n5#Great upgrade. Easy install looks modern\n6#Good quality at a better price. Seem to be good quality and installed as expected. Good value.\n7#Sleek & Reliable Double Rocker Switch. This Greencycle double rocker switch looks great and works smoothly. It’s easy to install, well-built, and perfect for controlling two lights from one spot. A solid choice for home or office upgrades!\n8#Functional. Installed easily and works as intended. I always wanted paddle switches. Affordable pricing as well.\n9#Good quality. Good quality and easy to install.\n10#They work. They do what they are supposed to do\n11#Very happy with the product. These worked great, really well-made and easy to install\n12#Good quality. Good quality for the price.\n13#Light switch. Like them something different\n14#One of two works, but how long? One of them didn't even need electrical connection to reveal its failure -- the switch paddle would not even stay in the off position. The second worked okay but felt a bit sketchy. I put it in a location where it will very seldom be used.\n15#works as expected. needed this style switch to go into wall plates along side kasa smart switches, and in some cases to be the other switch on cares of 3 way circuits where there was no neutral wire. these worked perfect and look nice next to the smart switches.\n16#Received ink cartridges. Two to a box. The box label states light switches but ink cartridges were in two of the four boxes. All are going back to keep it simple.",
