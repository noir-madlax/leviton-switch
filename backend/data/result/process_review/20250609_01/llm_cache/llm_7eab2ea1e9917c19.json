After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Single Pole Rocker Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Single Pole Rocker Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment.

Easy to install, good quality\n1#Excelente. Estoy remodelando mi casa y los compr√© y estoy s√∫per encantada con los resultados lo recomiendo un mill√≥n Amo\n2#Good fit. Fits good, and the quality is good\n3#Need bigger cover. Buena calidad, pero presentation fisica no tan buena.\n4#Buen producto.! S√∫per bellas y delicadas.! F√°cil de instalar.! Recomendados.! Y por el precio est√°n s√∫per bien.!\n5#Just okay. Easy enough to install, but doesn't sit flush against the wall, which makes them look cheap, IMO\n6#It looks nice. I don't like the clicks so much but we really don't notice it anymore\n7#Very easy to install and great smooth look, no screws showing üòÅ. I bought the 10 pack upgrading modern looking switches for older home. The best thing I liked about these is that there are no screws showing, very modern look. Would recommend.\n8#Perfect for the look we were going for! Way better than the glossy toggle switches at Lowe‚Äôs and Home Depot.\n9#Stylishew style, new look, new feel. They look stylish and modern.\n10#Nicer than anything big box sells. Look great easy to install\n11#These are GREY - not white. Product is grey (or gray depending where you grew up). The photo shows white but the product is not so it does not match white frames or walls.\n12#Great product and price. Same look for so much cheaper than the big box stores. These were very nice quality and easy to install if you know how.\n13#Nice looking switch, but very cheaply build. The operating range of the up-and-down switch is very small, hence it feels very cheap to push it to turn on and off the lights. Otherwise it works. I wouldn't buy it again.\n14#it is not easy to install. I tried installing them. But there are some wires that are difficult to plug in. I couldn't finish it with a thicker line.\n15#Look great. Easy to install and work great\n16#Perfecto. Buen precio y calidad\n17#Simple. These are good switches no issues easy to install material looks very sturdy and well-made\n18#Worked well. Used for light switched\n19#Cover Plates do not fit. About half of these cover plates will not fit. Now I have to look for something else. waste of money and time\n20#Love these. Very easy to use. And they look great.\n21#Great value. These were easy to install and look amazing!\n22#Good. Easy to use I like it\n23#Great product. Great product at a fraction of the costs from Home Depot! Definitely recommend",
