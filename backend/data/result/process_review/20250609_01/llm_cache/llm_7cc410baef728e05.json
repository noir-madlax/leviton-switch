Bought for some flips, couple switches came broken but overall great for price.\n1#Awful, poor quality, and don’t work properly. Just awful quality and functionality… they feel like they’re poorly made and many of them (we installed 6) wouldn’t stay in whatever position you flipped them to (if I turn a lite on, the switch would automatically flip back to off)… pay a little more and get better quality, it’ll save you the trouble of installing and then reinstalling.\n2#Won’t stay on. I have tried and tried to get customer support for assistance and they don’t seem to care at all! I bought close to 50 rocker switches and close to half will not stay on once installed. Very unhappy and disappointed.\n3#DO NOT BUY! These are the worst! I am building a house. I purchased 30 of these, paid an electrician to install them, then they wouldn't toggle into place. Once we had all the power on, some switches would stay on and not toggle off, some wouldn't even toggle on. I had to pay and electrician to remove and reinstall ones purchased from Home Depot. They were a disappointment. However, I did catch them on the last day of the return time frame and was able to get the money back from purchasing. Now I am just out the money of having to pay and electrician twice.\n4#Poor Quality - feels broken. Purchased a box of 10 switches for a project for $70. Installed 3 switches and 2 out of those 3 switches had zero resistance once installed and clicking into the ON position. These don’t feel safe as they don’t feel like they are clicking fully into the on position and I wouldn’t trust them. I un-installed them immediately and returned.\n5#Extremely inconsistent QC. I purchased well over 50 of these and the inconsistency in them was astounding. Some were fine, some had no resistance to the mechanism, some wouldn’t fully seat in the off position, and some wouldn’t change position at all. If I had a box of 10, it was safe to assume 2 would be unusable. Unfortunately I was only able to return part of the order as by the time we installed them the other portion had gone past the return period.\n6#Bad switches. Were hooked up by an electrician, first one connected caused the lights to flicker. Tried again with a different switch, same thing happened. Want to guess what happened with the third switch out of the box? If you thought it also caused the lights to flights to flicker, you would be correct. Went to a local hardware store and purchased a switch, brought it back and it worked beautifully. Not worth spending money on. I couldn’t return the item because it took so long to get the electrician out to the house and didn’t find out until it was too late to return the box of switches.\n7#Switch is broken or overly sensitive. These switches are terrible compared to the other brands I used. I put in over 30 new light switches of the same style and this brand is the only one that is either broken or too sensitive where the switch will randomly turn itself off because it doesn't sit deep enough in the in position. I could blow on this switch from 5 feet away when it's on to get it to click to off is how spring loaded it is to turn off.\n8#Heavy duty. I purchased heavy duty switches from Home Depot. These are identical. My electricians could not tell the difference of these switches. These are also heavy duty. Fast delivery.\n9#What is needed. Works as needed\n10#Cheap and unreliable. Only a few of these actually worked. Most of the time once you got them attached to the wires and screwed into the gang box, the switch was very touchy. Sometimes it would stay in the on position and other times it would teeter back and forth. Flickering the light. I would not recommend these has I had to replace at least 3/4 of them with ones I purchased at Home Depot.\n11#Useless and Poor quality. I’m an electrician to start off At first when I installed the first one I thought it was probably defective. Then 2nd then 3rd …etc. tried 10. All 10 the moment the terminal screw gets tightened it barely clicks to turn on You’ll have to loosen it up quite a bit for the switch to work which is not ideal because screw can easily become looser cause wire to start arcing. Replaced all with known brands like Legrand\n12#They work. Out of all the ones I got about 4 dont work right. Hopefully I wont have any problems returning or exchanging them",
