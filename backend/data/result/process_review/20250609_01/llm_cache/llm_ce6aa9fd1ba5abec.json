After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Toggle Style Dimmer Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Toggle Style Dimmer Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>.
