I used these switches to replace a couple of ceiling fan controllers which I no longer needed. These are single pole Decora paddle switches that have the press-in quick connectors. The installation was very simple, as I only had to press the stripped AC wires into the quick connect holes in the switches. The ground wire still needs to be screwed in, however. I like the UL listing, which means they have passed rigorous testing for safety. What I don’t like is the cheap feeling toggle feel of the switches. The off action, in particular, has this loud thunk sound instead of that satisfying click of a good quality switch. For my use, I can get past that since they will always be in the on position anyway since the fans now are operated by a remote controller. What I’m not sure I can get past is there is a noticeable gap at the top of the switch that my other switches do not have. Overall, I think these switches can be so much better if attention was paid to tolerances and switch feel. For the asking price, I would just go to the big box stores and purchase switches there and save money as well.\n1#Modern light switch. I like the paddle light switch because it’s more modern looking than the rocker types. These were easy to install if you know basic wiring. They are single pole so you control one light from one location.\n2#Extra switches. I bought these because I needed one for replacing my kitchen switch. It was easy to install and works great and I have a back up as needed.\n3#Easy install. Easy to change out and works as expected. So far no flickering. Looks nice.\n4#Good basic switches. These are good quality switches. The plastic and metal they're made of are not flimsy and the build quality is good - nothing rough or dinged or anything. Each switch is individually packaged. There are no covers but that's not a problem - makes it easier to use in multi-gang boxes. You can use either push-in or screw-type connections (the push-in looks to be limited to 14ga wire). Otherwise it's a basic outlet - nothing too exciting.\n5#They work. I needed to replace a switch and this did the job. Well packaged (individually wrapped in a box) with screws needed to install in the outlet box. Switch mechanism (on/off) is crisp. These have the typical wire connectors (wrap around screw or insert wire).\n6#Does the job. Nice looking rocker switches for a fair price. Fitment is good, not much else to say.",
