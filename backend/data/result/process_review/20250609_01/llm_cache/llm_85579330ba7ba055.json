These were fairly easy to install and the Alexa integration was not too difficult. After about 10 months of use, however, the manual switches don’t respond reliably. You can still control them with Alexa but you can press them manually several times and nothing will happen. I’m slowly replacing all of theses with Lutron switches. You get what you pay for on these. The Lutrons are more expensive but I installed several of those at the some time as these and they still work flawlessly (and look nicer too). Also, the red light for on and green light for off is weird. I could deal with that if they worked for more than a year, but they don’t.\n1#Works great. Works with Alexa and easy to setup\n2#Physical switch stops working. While the Wifi control still works, the physical switch stopped working after about 1 year. I would not recommend this product. What a headache to change out all these electrical switches and have them stop working after 1 year.\n3#The switch works only sometimes. The only thing you want a smart switch to do is at least to be as good as an old mechanical switch. You expect from a switch to consistently and instantly turn the light on and off as soon as you press it. This one doesn't. It's been working pretty much normally for a while, but in recent days it's only working sometimes. Sometimes I press the switch and it turns the light on or off, but sometimes it takes a few seconds or it just does nothing. It seems to depend on both the internet connection and the Smartlife services to be working fine. That is a stupid design flaw that speaks for the bad quality of the product. I don't want to lose the ability to switch lights on and off from the wall switch just because my internet connection isn't working well or if Smartlife's services aren't working well. Do not buy this product.\n4#Glitchy. They worked great… for less than a month. Now I have 2 of the 3 switches not connecting to WiFi and 1 of them still has the green light on, but won’t function even with the switch. These are junk, but it was the only set of 3 with an actual switch and wall plate I found. The reset instructions don’t work, so now I have 1 completely nonfunctional switch that looks like it is working, 1 functional switch that doesn’t connect to WiFi, and 1 switch that retains full functionality… for now. Don’t waste your time!\n5#Trash. Bought in July 2024, installed in July 2024, worn out by November 2024 and have to replace\n6#Breaks fast. I bought the 3 light switch- Looks nice, but it broke within the first few days of having it installed. One of the lights (specifically, the outside light) doesn’t turn on and the app says the device is “offline”. I would not recommend buying it.\n7#Good Customer Service. I had a contractor install this device as we were having some work done on our house. Overall everything went well accept I had a very hard time getting this to connect to our wifi. I contacted the seller and they responded quickly and after following their instructions, I was able to resolve the issue. Adding a family member to the account of the app was also very easy to do. So far we are happy with the end results. I dont quite like the feel of the buttons when turning them on and off, as the middle one doesnt feel like it connects, but it does. And since I am able to control everything wireless, this makes life a tad easier.\n8#Do not buy. Worst light switch ever. I bought 2 of them and both stopped working after 3 months. There’s a 30 sec delay when I switch the light and half the times it doesn’t switch on/off. Now I have to spend $1k for the electrician to reinstall a different switch. This is officially my worst purchase on Amazon.\n9#Great while it functions. Had two go out on me, beware of long term reliability.\n10#Super hard to pair. Nothing in the app really makes sense and then on top of that after set up timers. It uses a bunch of Asian characters. I don't understand.\n11#Easy to install, works great! Super easy to install, fits great, looks good!\n12#Jarvis, turn on the patio. Product Review: Smart Light Switch 3 Gang Smart Switch I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Smart Light Switch 3 Gang Smart Switch, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in terms of ease of installation, connectivity, and overall functionality. Here's my review of this impressive smart switch. First and foremost, the installation process for the Smart Light Switch was a breeze. With clear instructions and a user-friendly design, I was able to replace my existing switch without any hassle. The switch fit perfectly into the wall plate, and the included screws and wiring caps made the installation even easier. Even for someone with minimal electrical experience, I found the installation process straightforward and stress-free. Connecting the switch to the accompanying app was equally as seamless. By following the provided instructions, I was able to establish a connection between the switch and my smartphone within minutes. The app itself was intuitive and user-friendly, allowing me to control the switch effortlessly. When setting schedules, the app provided a range of features that made managing my lights a breeze. The sleek design of the Smart Light Switch also deserves a mention. Its modern and minimalistic look blends seamlessly with my home decor, adding a touch of sophistication to my living space. The switch itself feels sturdy and well-made, and the responsive touch buttons provide a satisfying tactile experience. When it comes to controlling the switch with the app, I found the experience to be smooth and hassle-free. Whether I was turning the lights on and off remotely or setting up conditional schedules, the app responded promptly without any glitches or delays. The connection remained stable, allowing me to control the switch reliably from anywhere within the world. One aspect worth noting is that the Smart Light Switch 3 Gang Smart Switch requires a stable 2.4 Ghz Wi-Fi connection to function properly. So, it's important to ensure that your home network is reliable for a seamless experience. In conclusion, the Smart Light Switch 3 Gang Smart Switch is a top-notch product that delivers on its promises. The easy installation process, seamless app connectivity, and stylish design make it a standout choice for anyone looking to upgrade their home lighting system. Controlling the switch through the app was effortless and glitch-free, enhancing the convenience and versatility of my lighting setup. If you're in the market for a reliable and aesthetically pleasing smart switch, I highly recommend giving this one a try.\n13#Excelente producto. Excelente producto\n14#Don't buy this item. Crappie set up\n15#Look for help. Not east to operate\n16#Easy to install and configure. I purchased 20 of them and my only complaint was that despite being placed in one order, two different styles of switches arrived. Other than that they were easy to configure with Alexa. I've had no problem renaming them or having response issues when I added them to a routine.\n17#Impressed. Works well! We normally use Phillips Hue bulbs but we were updating our light fixtures to include multiple small bulbs so that would have been way more expensive. I like that I can choose to turn it off/on manually via the switch or via app/Google home -- for the Hue lights if you use the wall switch to turn off you can no longer turn it on remotely. I did have trouble getting it to connect to wifi but customer support was able to help. Now that it's connected it works flawlessly. One downside compared to the Hue is that the bulbs aren't dimmable with the switch (at least I don't think) but it didn't claim to be dimmable so I can't fault the product for that. Overall very happy.\n18#This is a three pack of switches that work well with Alexa. I got the three switch setup. Understand though, this is just a 3-pack of switches and a 3 switch plate. You do NOT have to put them into the same place (and they fit fine with my existing three switch plate because we have the wide/flat type switch already). Wiring was pretty straight forward, but you do have to pay attention to make sure you wire the correct wires. For most homes with a standard switch, it matters little if they reverse the wires - a standard switch just completes the circuit. For these, you have to connect the correct wires, so if the person that did your wiring was lazy, it can be annoying sorting out the wires. Setup was simple after getting them installed correctly and Alexa app integration was simple and fast.\n19#Great deal. Easy instal. Works great.\n20#Love the light switches, except one little detail... Everyone in my house comments on the green and red lights on the switches. I am ok with them having lights, but the lights are green when the lights are off and red when the lights are on. This seems so backwards to us we still can not get used to it. I was surprised I did not recall seeing anyone comment about this in the reviews. I would have chosen differently because my brain tells me green means on and red means off...but not in these switches. Otherwise they work great.\n21#Easy to install, works great with alexa. Easy to install, wire and works great with alexa. Highly recommend\n22#Easy. Works as intended, easy to use app and Alexa integration\n23#Works great. Easy to install and works great.\n24#Great buy. It works like a charm, changed out all my smart bulbs. Take a little trial and error to get the first one up.\n25#Smart switch convenience. Easy to interview and setup to control the lights/fan in our kids bedroom through Alexa.\n26#Works great with Alexa and Google. This was really easy to install and program comes in 3 separate pieces tho works great I have them set on my Alexa to run certain times and one is my garage and when motion is set from another device it turns on automatically so far I would recommend only had them in for two weeks so take that with a grain of salt",
