Works with adt z wave\n1#Good switch, needed to factory reset to add. Great switch and easy to use once I got it connected. Mine must have been previously used and returned because I had to factory reset the switch before I could add it to my SmartThings hub. The paper instructions provided with the switch were incorrect- a factory reset requires quickly pressing the on button three times then quickly pressing the off button three times. After I figure that out, piece of cake!\n2#Simple to install but firmware bugs make it useless, AVOID. Infuriating firmware bugs. AVOID! This dimmer switch has an INSANE delay when shutting off the light, after pressing the off button there is a 2-3 second delay before anything happens at all. And sometimes it does nothing at all, just stays on, insane that they screwed up something as simple as a light switch... They're basically waiting to see if you'll be pressing and holding the button to dim it BEFORE doing anything at all, which is so bad for the user experience. There is also a Parameter 16 which when set to 1 will make this dimmer act like a normal on/off switch, BUT when you set this parameter to 1 then z-wave controls fail to turn it off!!!\n3#Died in 6 Months. I bought this 6 months ago and it already died. It did function well for the time that it did work but I should have just bought the enlightened brand which lasted me 5 years so I will be buying that one again.\n4#Fixed a flickering LED. This is the third switch I tried to get an LED light/bath fan I bought at Lowes to stop flickering and it worked. Only complaint is that the first one of these I bought had issues with the physical buttons working but Amazon returned it with no issues. That's the only reason for 1 star off.\n5#Slow Responsiveness to the Turn Off action. Good quality switch with plenty of features and configuration options. Only downside is the slowness of the Turn Off action when pressing the paddle. It takes almost 1 second before it responds to pressing the button which is way too long. Users feel the switch is not working and end up pressing the button multiple times.\n6#Thanks for the piece of trash. Horrible quality didn't last more than 2 years. That or Samsung SmartThings hub 2015 model sabotaged it. Can't tell. Don't care. I hate them both\n7#Simple and Quality. These dimmers are simple to install and configure. They last a long time and work well with my automation controller. An add on switch is easy to install for 3-way control. I like the rocker style where a single press turns it on or off and holding the rocker dims or brightens. The look works well with non-smart rocker switches.\n8#Dimmer setting keeps going low on its own. I'll set this switch for maximum brightness, yet about 50% of the time, next time I command the switch on, it will be way down to its dimmest setting, and I have to manually turn up the brightness again. Dim setting should remain where it was last time the light was turned off.\n9#Pure junk. Switch is horrible. Very hard to install and configure. I pressed the blue tooth reset button more than 10x and it never synced with my home smart system. Also, the plate did not fit properly. It's made from very cheap plastic. You get what you pay for. Since I had to remove this from my wall and return it, it was not worth the hassle since unwiring and shutting off breakers took 30-45 minutes. Don't waste your time and buy a better product.\n10#Excelente precio y calidad. Interrumptor elegante, facil de instalar, es economico y funciona a la perfección con RING\n11#Not connecting to Zwave hub! did everything possible to connect it to my Zwave hub with no success!\n12#Great switch. Replaced old GE switch and found this one much easier to use and stays connected consistently.\n13#Works fine, easy to install. Easy to install. I like the wire terminations. The only problem I had was that it isn't one of the selections to mate with my Vera hub. I had to install it as a generic Z-wave device so I only have the ability to turn it on and off rather than having full dimming capabilities. It works fine manually however so I'm happy with it.\n14#The latest z-wave 700 series is a huge improvement. Unfortunately, the 700 series backward Z-Wave compatibility is limited. Adding this switch pushed my rather large HS3 system (previously living happily in obsolescence) over the edge. Much consternation, denial, expense, and effort later, I am converted to HS4 (Many thanks to Homeseer Help Desk people, who were patient and helpful in the transition). With the latest HS updates and a new Z-Net hub, I now have improved functionality in my system with this new switch as a powerful repeater in the HS network. I highly recommend Z-Wave, Z-Net, HS4, and this switch. I can't give 5 stars to something that set me on such a big, unplanned project. Those already on HS4 should love this dimmer/switch.\n15#Buzz. It works, connects to my Z wave hub fine, but makes a very annoying buzzing sound. I bought 4 total for all my bedrooms. Every single one buzzes. It’s probably a design issue.\n16#Not the most feature rich but cheap. This works fine but you don’t get many Z-wave config options like disabling the dimming when the lights are turned on/off.\n17#Basic (for Z wave) dimmer. Edit: lowering to 4 stars. The fixed ramp up/down times are no good. My better half was annoyed by waiting a few seconds for the lights and I could not fix that with this dimmer; had to swap it with another brand. Original review: Compared to Zooz and Inovelli, these switches have a very limited set of configuration options. Compared to most other smart switches they have a lot of options. So far it’s been the least tricky of my Z wave dimmers, but that’s mostly because of the above. Are the 20-50% savings worth losing the configuration options? For lesser used dimmers I’d say yes.\n18#A-1. Great product\n19#Worked as expected. This wired up just like the one removed and connected to the home automation system with ease.\n20#Humming noises. This light switch makes a loud humming noise when connected to my ceiling fan. I replaced a GE Z-Wave dimmable light switch that did not make this horrible noise. I was going to move this switch to a different location, however I may return it. I’ll update this based on what I can figure out. Edit: I did change the switch to a different location without a ceiling fan. The humming sound disappeared, however, I could not sync the light switch with my SmartThings hub. It may have been a defective light switch. I'm going to return this one (59350) and get a different model (54897) that has worked in the past for me.\n21#easy to install z-wave dimmer. easy to install with plug in wire connections. works great with a live line, load line and neutral wire.",
