After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Universal Multi-Load Dimmer Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a.

Maybe defective units. They work in turning lights on/off. Did not work for one light switch where old dimmer was working fine. Also in a three way configuration, it did not work as expected. Maybe user error but regardless not a 5 star item.\n1#Works well. I installed two, one on a three-way and one on the single pole without a hitch. Items work as described and as expected.\n2#dimmer very nice. easy to put up. Instructions are clear. Didn't need my husbands help! Works very well\n3#Work OK, but very sensitive. Not much play in the dim. Work OK, but very sensitive. Not much play in the dim.\n4#No flickering lights! I tried 3 different dimmer switches, and they didn't prevent the LED bathroom light from flickering. I installed this switch, and from the get-go, there was no flickering at all. Highly recommend.\n5#Avoid this item. Item was two non-dimmer switches, each with frayed wires attached to it from a previous owner. Unusable. I strongly recommend against purchasing this.\n6#Great product. no problems.",
