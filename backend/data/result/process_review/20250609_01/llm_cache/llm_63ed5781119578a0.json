Work great. Use all the time now. Price is good to\n1#As expected. Good Quality\n2#We love so much about these but..... We love so much about these, but the biggest issues are around the fact that they prevent most switch plate covers from laying flat. All this has to do with the thickness of the tabs and the fact that they a portion you must awkwardly snap off. Plastic on the tabs also can interfere with easy screw tightening. the irony is the engineers intentions were probably good....trying to make larger tabs that interlock for fixed spacing and flatter installations, but this was a big fail. the tabs are bigger but too flimsy to force outlets flat and the problems above were created. The auto spacing kinda works. The actual outlet and switch features are great. Easy to install wires and no exposed wires or contacts. Please make tabs out of all metal\n3#Levers make installation quick. Love the levers on the back to secure wires, no more trying to twist a wire around a screw. And I love that the easily line up with each other when installing. Made switching out old switches around my house a piece of cake.\n4#A Welcome Upgrade. These are wonderful, easy to install, safe, functional. A little pricey but a huge time saver.\n5#Excelente %100. Excelente lo recomiendo\n6#Very beautiful. Value for money, quality, fit perfect, noise level, timer on point, adhesive quality. Timer. Thanks a million my place looks awesome.\n7#Great product crappy shipping prep. The product was shipped in an envelope with zero protection manufacturers box was broken open and the switches had spilled out in side\n8#very good. This is a good, reliable product that our electrician recommended to us.\n9#Speed to install. These switches make installing a large number fast. Some say they worry about the clamps popping open while installing switch in box. I did not feel that way. If you are good at managing your wires then this is no issue. If you a push and crammer then you may have an issue. Only thing that slows you down is they are meant to be used with the brands no screw covers that are way to expensive even for convenience. You have snap the top and bottom tab to use traditional screw-less plates or traditional plates.\n10#Easy!! So easy to use. Sure wish I had found these sooner.\n11#Great value. Works as advertised not sure about durability but its well made at great price\n12#Easy to install! As I definitely am not a handy man, when I asked my neighbor about changing the switches, he urged me to get these that were a lot simpler to install than the cheaper ones. Its definitely worth paying a little more for the ease of installation and with a reputable brand.\n13#Just as advertised. Push, click done. These things are just too cool. I've always had good luck with the Leviton brand. If you joined a switch with a Wago connector, this is what you would get. This greatly simplifies installation. No more bending j-hooks. Just: Strip the wire, flip open the lever, push the wire into the hole, flip the lever closed, and give the wire a little tug to insure it's secured. It couldn't be easier. If you're doing any remodeling, make sure to get some of the Leviton wall receptacles with this same feature. You will thank yourself. I would definitely recommend this item.\n14#worked great. We have purchased these more than once. We are changing out our old outlets and switches and we really like these and have had no issues. They look great!\n15#Light switch. Is a lot easier to change all my lights switch\n16#Easy to install. Very easy to work with\n17#not able to use old face plate. make sure you order face plate to fit this switch, the old one remove from the unit will not fit this new style.\n18#Wiring made easy. I wasn’t a fan of these push in connectors at first, but they grew on me. It makes the wiring of switches a lot easier and faster. They also look great when installed. I’ve installed over 100 switches at this point and can definitely recommend these. Very easy to use and they are built with quality.\n19#I love these. Not cheap. As a good ol boy homeowner, I’ve done a lot of household wiring. I was an electrician's helper long ago. There are 3 things I like about the Decora switches. One is the attractive, less severe rocker. Next is the screwless cover plate and inner plate attachment design where they interlock for ideal spacing. Lastly and most importantly is the connection scheme with locking levers to grasp the copper. Not cheap, but my go to.\n20#Easy install. The dlip tab where the wires attach is convenient and easy. Otherwise you can’t tell these from other paddle switches.\n21#Easy to use. I like the push and snap connections… they make the job of installing quite simple.\n22#Looks great. Hope wire connection system holds up. Great fit. On older design you have a screw connection or quick push in. I’ve noticed over the years the push in connection isn’t very reliable and sometimes fails. This does not have the screw in option and only has a push in with lever lock. Hopefully it holds up. Time will tell.\n23#Easy. Easy to use although an electrician said these types of receptacles don’t make good connections compared with their counterparts.\n24#Works well, and is easy to install. This is a fine product and works well. These also work with the screwless wall plates, just break off the tabs, and all will be well.\n25#Very nice product. I changed all my outlets and switches. Awesome home improvement products.\n26#Big time saver replacing old switches. Easy to install instead of screw type connection\n27#The wire attachment is great, but. Be aware that it's a bulky switch and sometimes a tight fit. Replacing old toggle switches in an old house sometimes meant chipping away at plaster to expose the full box.\n28#Easy. Easy to install bought tamper proof by mistake\n29#Work well. Nice clean color easy to turn light on look nice\n30#Awesome, awesome light switches. I didn't check the Alexa integration because I don't have them integrated with Alexa. I bought these to replace all switches in a bathroom I'm remodeling. The level locks are a beautiful design and make installation easy. When using 2 or more side-by-side, they fit together perfectly. I used screwless covers with them and they're so cool. They look great and install easily. If I were to improve on the switches (and the receptacles which I also purchased) I would add the ability to add more than 1 wire to each locking terminal. But I will keep using these!\n31#Easiest and Fastest Way to Wire a Switch. I’ve been swapping out switches in my house, purely for aesthetic reasons. These switches are a breeze to install. I cut out the old switches, re-strip the wires, pop them into the new switch and close the levers. Done. Each switch replacement takes me about 5 minutes start to finish.\n32#My electrician loved these. They are very easy to install and look new and improved. Great quality.\n33#Great product. I purchased these switches to replace old switches in my house. It is so easy to install and looks very good. I have to install the switches next each other in several places, these new switches with alignment feature make this kind of installation super easy.\n34#Not for Screwless plates. Inexplicably, these switches and the similarly designed outlets leave a gap between the face plate and the wall when paired with the Leviton screwless face plates. That occurs because the plastic upper and lower margins prevent the face plate mount to reach the wall. While I found the install super easy (though long term durability compared to screw terminals is not yet known) I had to return them since we had gone to a screwless look.\n35#Fake? Mushy buttons. I've ordered a whole bunch of these. I don't know if I got fake/counterfeit ones or if the product is just bad, but like half of the switches are mushy. They'll click when pressed down but be soft when pressed up.\n36#Not exactly perfect. Good quality, but the extra plastic on the mounting plate causes issues when putting on screwless cover plates. It’s relatively easy to cut with snips or heavy scissors or a good knife though. I’m not sure why the extra plastic is there. If I’d have known about this, I would have ordered a different switch. The ease of the wire installation is more than offset by the pain to trim this plastic.\n37#China Switch. I went against my rule! DO NOT BUY LEVITON PRODUCTS ONLINE. I could not install these crappy switches in my house, let alone anyone else's house! Leviton should be embarrassed to sell this junk to the public!\n38#super easy to install these. Great product. Very easy to install.\n39#Save space in your switch box and cut your installation time in half with the Decor Edge Switches. I'm upgrading all of my light switches to Kasa Smart Switches but not every switch needs to be smart, especially on 3-way and 4-way circuits. I originally started with some cheap rocker switches but returned them when I found the Decora Edge. Smart switches take up a lot of space in multi-gang boxes, which doesn't leave much room for wire nuts or Wago connectors. With these switches, the wires stab directly into the switch or outlet and are much safer vs. backstabbing, which every YouTube electrician and DIYer says not to do. One warning, these switches are huge and you'll want to make sure your wallplate is going to fit.\n40#Super fast install. Super fast install. Rock solid connection. Yanked around on them to the point a backstab definitely would have failed and these held on tight.\n41#Really like these. I am replacing all my toggle switches with these and I know folks will say to only use screw terminals, but these really are great. While one usually has to strip the wire when switching switches, not having to bend the wire place it around the screw (in the correct direction) really does save a lot of time. Folks I am sure will say a screw terminal is tighter and more secure, but I really pulled on these after pushing down the lever…didn’t you move at all. I trust the brand so that is why I went with this style (wouldn’t for a random brand).\n42#Awesome and Easy to Install but can NOT be used as a switched Receptacle. As stated, these are great and easy to install. I purchased the plates along with them as well. What you may not know is that if you replace an outlet attached to a switch, that will no longer work. The whole outlet will remain hot/live. It's not a big deal but now I have to purchase separate outlets for all the ones attached to switches so take that into consideration when you are looking to know out your whole home etc.\n43#EASY INSTALL. After watching a you tube video testing the strength of these outlets, I decided they would be well worth the try! I was NOT disappointed! These are a game changer! Highly recommend!!! Super easy install\n44#Easy. Secures wire easily\n45#Easiest switch to install. I've replaced many switches over the years of several different styles. I have no problem using traditional wiring techniques. But for easy of use I'll go with these all day. Between these and WAGO connectors the time savings for just home repairs is great. And they don't cost much more then standard quality switches. (BTW, if using in a standard size wall plate make sure to break off the tabs on the top like it shows.)\n46#Easy Installation. My electrician gave this product a 👍🏻\n47#TOO BIG. STANDARD WALL PLATES WON'T COVER. These are pretty easy to install, but we had to go back and adjust some of them because the connection wasn't good. Also, standard wall plate covers do not fit over these!!! and the snap on covers are UGLY!!!\n48#The best. These are awesome! I'm so happy to see these being sold in the US. They get a lot of hate for some reason, but I've never had any issues with them. Installation is ridiculously easy.",
