Unlike other regular switches, this one lacks smoothness and requires significant force to operate. Additionally, it is relatively lightweight. Notably, the “Leviton” embossing on the switch appears to serve no purpose other than to attract dust and create a sense of dirtiness.\n1#Received a USED switch with wires still attached! Seriously. Not only is the switch USED, it still has the old wires attached.\n2#Failed in less than a month! Warranty claim ??? Installed correctly myself but when turning light on, lights would flicker. Got concerned about this so ordered a switch from a different company and hired an electrician to come out. He confirmed this Leviton switch was a defect and no matter how tightly the screws are fastened, there is an internal fault that causes flickering. Looks like I need to file a warranty claim for this thing now. Really annoying as I had to hire an electrician to confirm what I already suspected. I have used Leviton switches before and they worked fine, but it’s very frustrating to get a bad one.\n3#Just what’s I needed! Needed this 4 way switch for home switch upgrade. Exactly what I needed and at a great price. Worked like a charm. The switches look beautiful.\n4#Price gouging. I don't understand why electrical devices that just a few years ago were 'cheap' are not >5x the price. This one is a standard 4way switch. It works fine, but I feel like a chump for paying the full price for it. Feels unethical to charge this much for a simple light switch. Also, as others stated, the switch action is a bit stiff and loud. I didn't think it would matter to me until I put it in the wall and have to actually concentrate when flipping the switch, to apply extra pressure to make it 'pop'. Strange that it's so stiff. And again, if I hadn't spent the same amount of $$ on it as a nice meal in a restaurant, I wouldn't be so picky :)\n5#Awesome product. I changed all my outlets and switches. Awesome home improvement products. Face plate makes the product look amazing.\n6#Technically works but not as nicely as 2-way and 3-way. The switch is considerably more difficult to press than a regular 2-way or 3-way switch. The switch also does not look like it is completely on/off in comparison to a 2-way or 3-way (the plastic on the switch sticks out and is not flush). Also, I had a difficult time installing a switch plate over it. It's as if the screw holes not the proper distance, or perhaps the whole thing was bowed/bent.\n7#Alright switch. Operation feels alright.\n8#2 Failed in less than a year. Two switches failed in less than a year of light use. Installed a bunch of Leviton switches, so far all of them are doing well except for the two 4-ways. The 4-ways started for physically separate as seen in the photo. I replaced them with a different brand.\n9#Switch is very hard to press and. Switch is very hard to press and also make s noise when pressed. It is working but but feel cheap.\n10#Works As Described. Works As Described\n11#Not soft to operate. I like the quality of the wire connections. Dont like how hard it is to switch on/off. Not a soft rocker switch at all. Sorta makes a loud click sound. Just doesn’t feel correct to me\n12#Worked good. I have a rental that we were changing out the switches to white and discovered the living room used two four way switches. These worked good a replacements. Not all four way switches connect the same. Pay attention to the In and out of the one your replacing and make sure those wires go to the in and out of this one. But in the end, happy with them.\n13#Not bright white. Item is more of an off white. It doesn't match any of my \"white\" switches\n14#Easy to install, but not as nice as other competitors. This product is sold at a good price. However, the finish and the switch itself are not as sleek and smooth as other competitors such as Lutron and Legrand.\n15#not set up like diagrams on the web. This is a nice little switch and my first time installing a 4 way into an existing 2 switch circuit. There are instructions inside the box but I was unable to read them. After I figured out the switch with a continuity meter the installation was actually more logical than what I found on the web.\n16#Defective switch top brass term screw missing! 2nd SW Return 9.25.23, top black term screw missing! Nothing worse than getting a defective device ; it was a used switch! Improve your QA!! I know Amazon will replace it but when I order a part I except to get a NEW device, not one hacked by someone and returned to stock!! Update: 2nd SW Return 9.25.23, top black terminal screw was missing! I do not what to deal with your poor inventory management. I will buy local at Home Depot! I suspect you will send both defective switches that I returned to another customer once you return the SW's to stock without correcting the screw problem.\n17#Not actually quiet. Why the heck does this have “quiet” in the name? It’s twice as loud as the identical 5604-2WS from the same company.\n18#NOT A QUIET SWITCH. It works fine as a 4-way switch, but it's definitely NOT QUIET. It has a super loud click, louder than any other switch I have at home. Unfortunate, since I picked this one specifically to install next to a crib.\n19#Not quiet at all (louder than the 20-year old outlets I’m replacing). I assumed I was paying extra for better quality and QUIET light switches (the word ‘quiet’ is in the item description). These are louder than any light switch I’ve ever used! I was either sent the wrong product, or these are falsely advertised.\n20#Can't get it at the store? Buy it here. I went to a popular home improvement depot and to my surprise, they did not have this 4-way rocker switch (not a common switch). I bought it here. It went right in, price was decent, and I haven't looked back since.\n21#Leviton is a good fix. Good quality\n22#Click Clack Loud. This is not a quiet switch as advertised. My wife was clacking this switch downstairs and it was so loud.\n23#Do not waste your money. Trash. These switches either make the lights flicker or are on a long delay anytime you flip them. Several of them flat out did not work at all. We have wasted easily $1000 trying to make these work with our electrician.\n24#Not quiet. Overall the switch is ok, but I don`t know why it says \"Quiet switch\". It is not Quiet, I can hear its sound really well\n25#DOA. Dead on arrival. Waited to long because I thought I wired it wrong. Electrician confirmed it's trash. Risk of buying from the internet's garbage dump.\n26#Product feel... I opted to by switches in bulk like this so the would match throughout the house, but these switches have a pretty cheap feel to them when compared to other slightly more expensive switches of the same style.\n27#Flimsy, terrible feel. How does this product has 4 stars is beyond me. This is not a quiet switch! Terrible feel compared to other single pole Leviton switches I have installed.\n28#Faulty Switch. The internal connector was bad on one of the switches so it only words some of the time. The other one worked as expected. Kinda bummed that I have to buy another one.\n29#4way switch. Switch works perfect and the price was better than other retailers!\n30#Just ok. This switch works but it isn’t a quality feeling when you toggle it on and off\n31#Horrible on/off feel quality - flimsy. I was sure this switch had been used 10,000 times before I put it into service. But it looks new with new screws. So it seems like the manufacturer has probably decide to save a penny somewhere and added a cheap spring somewhere. The throw of the switch feels like it's barely flipping the switch and it feels like it's going to completely give out after 10 uses. Shame on you Leviton!\n32#Leviton is always a solid choice and product. Items delivered were the consistent quality associated with Leviton that I know and expect.\n33#Surprisingly poor quality. The switch delivered from Amazon was of surprisingly poor quality. I have installed well over 1,000 Leviton switches over the years. Depending on the grade of switch, they have all installed and performed as expected. The switch that was delivered had two terminal bolts that were installed at an angle, and when partially backed out showed stripping of the threads. The switch casing was also slightly skewed, making it hard to fit into a standard plate. As I needed to get the job done, I took terminal bolts from another switch and, with considerable effort, got them to seat in the internal square nuts. A bit of careful trimming with a utility knife got the faceplate on. I hope this doesn’t reflect a decrease in quality of Leviton’s switches. Despite becoming lighter and a bit more flimsy over the years, they have remained reliable.\n34#Different sound. This switch has a lower sounding clunk upon activation, compared to normal 3 way levitons.. Nothing wrong just noticeably different sounding. You can't just copy the wire positions in the old switch since they can move around, watch out!\n35#Defective. I replaced a standard goggle 4-way with this one while upgrading the switches in one location with some smart switches. This switch feels mushy and is not quiet. The main reason for returning it is that it sometimes gets stuck in a position where none of the outputs are energized and you can then not control the light from another switch.\n36#Mushy feeling, one of the nuts was stripped. I installed a number of Leviton single-pole switches, and I like them, but the feel of this quiet switch is rather mushy. It's not a big deal as it works well enough. What was frustrating was the stripped threads on one of the nuts. When I began to install it, I noticed one of the screws was in, so I began to unscrew it, and it was extremely tight. I succeeded after a little effort and saw the threads were stripped in the nut. After ten minutes of faffing about, I managed to screw it down well enough that I'd get a good connection that would hold, but if it's unscrewed, the screw will pop out of the nut.\n37#Product came used + damaged. The switch I received was clearly used - the green paint on the grounding screw was coming off from where a screwdriver had previously been used on it. The switch also was dirty and worn. Beyond looking worn, the feel of the switch isn't smooth at all and makes inconsistent sounds when engaging. It's just not a good product. All my other (two and three way) switches in the house are Leviton and have been impresive. However, this four way switch was significantly more expensive and is a dud. I don't have time to replace it again but the product was very disappointing. If I could do it again, I'd definitely buy a different switch.\n38#Defect. Item came in defective. Switch worked well in one position and the other position required the user to push and hold the switch in a certain way to make the connection. Of course, this was refunded and I replaced with a commercial grade switch but still a waste of time.\n39#Used or already installed switch. Received a part that was used or already installed. Box was ripped with finger prints on it. All the screws were back out and one screw showed strip marks from a screw driver. This is going back.\n40#Bad quality. One of the sockets was loose and it took me a little bit of time to make it work. The product feels cheap. I would buy a different one in future.\n41#Not bad, just buy it. Overall, it is a decent product. Push button function is a little sticky.\n42#Looks good and easy to install. You buy Leviton for the name and typically in electrical that’s the name you go for. This installs easy as does any other switch. A huge call out I noticed was that these switches have much more resistance when pressing on or off. For example, the single pole switches have a nice feel when you turn on and off. This requires you to press the toggle harder in either direction. I bought 3 of them and this is consistent on all 3. Just something to know because I thought it would be easier to toggle than it is.\n43#Works as expected but not very smooth. This is a 4-way switch. Couldn't find it at the local home depot. Switch rocker is not smooth and a little loud. Took a star off for that. Otherwise works as expected.\n44#Good value for quantity. As described. Good value and looks.\n45#great switch. Great 4 way switch only cheaper than buying local, good shipping speed.\n46#Easy replacement for existing failed switch. Pretty straight forward. It was a direct replacement for my existing switch. Not a problem to install.",
