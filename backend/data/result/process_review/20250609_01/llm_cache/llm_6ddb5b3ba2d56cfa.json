Excellent dimmer switch. Works great !!!\n1#Love this dimmer! This dimmer worked great right out of the package for my lamp project. I make lamps on the side and I have found a perfect match to dum the bulbs to give that perfect ambient glow. Highly recommend this dimmer and cord.\n2#Great choice & value. Just what is highly needed for repairing any light fixtures & again on the great Amazon\n3#WARNING: FIRE HAZARD! I've read similar warnings from different brands, so I chose this product over the others. My device was correctly installed within safety standards and load guidelines; however, about a month after installation, this product failed at the switch, almost starting a house fire. I came home to the smell of burning plastic, a fire alarm, and my pets going wild. I discovered the switch smoking and melting just in time to prevent a fire. I could have lost my home over this substandard piece of equipment. I bought four of these and immediately removed the other devices for safety. BUYER BEWARE; DON’T TAKE THE RISK!\n4#Worth it. Well made. Dimmer works well. Easy to install\n5#Almost caught my house on fire. Follow directions to a T. I’ve also taken a year of electricity and magnetism at a university level so I’m not exactly uneducated on how to use this. Smelled burning one day and luckily I was home because it was on fire. They must use a cheap resistor.\n6#Works well with LED and incandescent bulbs. Easy to modify with a little soldering to use a different cord on the output to extend the length to make my needs. Quality control a little suspect because 1 of the 2 I ordered didn’t have the nut securing the dimmer to the switch body under the dial. Circuit board looked well made and while the soldering wasn’t the best, both worked and were easily modified to take a different output cord leading to my unswitched lamp.\n7#Works great. Installed this on a Mobilgas globe. I use it for a night light when the grandkids are here\n8#Switch burnt out 2nd year. I liked it when it worked. Ive had dimmer swirches last life time 2nd year burnt out\n9#NOT a plug in extension cord. This is not a typical extension cord that you plug your electrical item into and get the desired extension plus a dimmer feature. The end you would plug into is two wires.\n10#Happy with these. I purchased these for my reptile enclosure and have been happy with them so far. I wish they were a little longer, but for the price, they can't be beat!\n11#Great for reptile lights! I have four of these and they work great for reptile heat lamps. My carpet pythons need different levels of heat based on the weather so these are much easier than constantly stocking and swapping heat bulbs of varying wattages. In hindsight, white would have looked much cleaner, wonder if I can find that?\n12#You don’t know or yet. But you need this dimmer cord. Great way to convert your existing lamp, to a dimmable one. Great valve, For this Low price, you will want to convert all your lamps. I highly recommend this very well made item. You will too.\n13#Good with a couple of caveats. This product worked well moving my lamp through the entire range of brightness. However, it's only really adjustable on my LED bulb in the last 1/3 or so of the dimmer, as turning the dimmer for the first 2/3s doesn't turn the bulb on. Sometimes the bulb will flicker like a candle too.\n14#Converted regular plug to dimmer switch. These cords were just what we needed after ordering new wall lamps only to find out they didn’t have a on/off switch. Easily converted them with these cords\n15#Uneven dimming. I only used one of these to retrofit an led into a fish tank hood, where I did not have enough room for a traditional dimmer. It seemed to be okay, however the dimming curve seems very uneven with the lamp getting very bright or dim instead of a nice smooth curve. It is a dimmable led, and I might expect it to have an uneven curve, but not the dead spots and bright spots, leading me to believe it is this switch. It does work, and looks good, just isn’t a smooth dimmer.\n16#Does what is expected from good dimmer switch with manual control. I have bought and used about 10 of these on home made lamps. They work great.\n17#Rheostat on a cord actually cheaper than just the rheostat! I'm using these with incandescent bulbs and also ceramic heaters to heat my reptile enclosures. You can buy rheostats that simply install on existing lamp cords. They are actually more expensive than these rheostats already on a cord and are actually less expensive! They work exactly as you would expect.\n18#Both of these sparked stank and failed.Junk. Both of these sparked and stank failed.Junk.Sucks after wiring a lamp and have to redo.\n19#Great dimmer switch for table lamps. Switches work great. Easy to install.\n20#Good Value. Works well for a reasonable price.\n21#Made to Last. Fast Delivery! I made a “Flash Gordon” style Rocket Lamp for my son for Christmas. You can see with the LED light bulbs how well it works. (I should probably get lower watt bulbs next time. Lol) Anyway, the switch is very well made to last for years. I was kind of playing with it in the clip, but it’s very smooth when moving from dark to light and vice versa.\n22#Safety concern! Safety issue. The dimmer caught fire. Fortunately I noticed the smell in time before it burned our home down!\n23#Very good product. Prompt delivery, power cord w/dimmer worked very well\n24#Nice dimmer but short cord and non polarized plug. The cord was a few inches under 5 feet, run the cable up the lap and not a whole lot left over. Worked for me but be careful. The bad is the plug is not polarized. This means you could have the lamp turned off and still have high voltage in the socket. I was looking for this type of dimmer. I'm just going to remove the dimmer and try to place on my old lamp cord which is polarized.\n25#A great choice for in-line dimming. I don't know why more lamps and devices don't come with an in-line slider or dial — glad to find this replacement! I took apart two lamps, spliced the cord in, and it works like a charm. Because my lamps in particular didn't disassemble down to the terminals, I used some heat-shrink tubing at the point of wires connecting. I didn't solder, but that's also an option if you worry about the lines coming apart. Two things to know: 1. The cord length is short. You basically have to have your lamp right next to an outline. And since you can't move the dimmer box up and down on the cable, it may end up in an awkward position. 2. As others have noted, the rotation isn't purely linear. Basically the first 50% of rotation has no effect, leaving all the dimming action into a relatively small range of motion. Still, it's much less bulky than the plug-in dimmers which introduce an extra 6 feet of cord all jumped in the same place.\n26#Not what I expected and doesn't function as a dimmer. I wish they had made it much clearer that one end of this dimmer switch is EXPOSED WIRE. If you're like me, and you thought you could just plug your lights into one end and plug the other end into the wall, well, you'd be wrong. After my initial shock at finding the exposed wire on one end (seriously, WHY?), I gave it my best attempt anyway and wrapped the filaments around the prongs of my lights (which seems like an extremely dangerous thing to have to do...) and plugged it in. when the dimmer switch is turned all the way up, my lights work at full strength. anywhere else and the lights have a very fast strobe/flicker effect...still at full brightness though. I bought this specifically to help with my video making setup and it's utterly useless, unless I was going for an \"epilepsy warning needed\" vibe. terrible product and very disappointing. will be pursuing a refund with amazon because screw this. Do not buy!\n27#Works but flickers. Easy to install and adjusts nicely over the full range of brightness. However, it flickers, quite noticeably on the brightest setting.\n28#Meh... They look good, are good quality, but the light flickers no matter how I adjust it.\n29#my LEDs are not happy. constant flickering, strobing, and surging with my LED lights\n30#Not great. Top voltage 92V. Tried this out and found that when turned up all the way, the voltage drop was over 10%. Not sure if this is standard, but I was surprised. Otherwise, as indicated. Build seems of sufficient quality.\n31#Overheats and stops working. I wired the dimmer switch to a chandelier I wanted dimmable and it \"works\" but after a while the switch gets hot and the chandelier goes to full brightness and the switch no longer dims or turns the chandelier off and I have to unplug it to turn it off.\n32#Save time and money... don't buy this. Couldn't even handle a 40 watt bulb without literally melting and smoking. Pure crap.\n33#It's a dimmer switch, it was cheap and it worked. Purchased a two pack as I wanted to experiment with one of them. It is easy to dismantle the casing and adapt it to a gate valve for a steampunk set up. Adjustment on dimmable LED bulbs is definitely not linear, meaning you move the rotary switch a lot and get no adjustment to brightness but then hit a sweet spot were if you even breath on it, it will make a fairly large adjustment to the brightness. all in all a good purchase so far.\n34#Think again. After 5-10 minutes the switch overheated and the light had to be unplugged. After 2 more switches came, they did the same thing! Would not suggest these to anyone!! Sending back all 4 switches today\n35#Good quality. Good quality\n36#Works as expected. Works as expected\n37#Well made and works great. It is an attractive compact design that I used for dimming a hanging light fixture with LED lights. I liked that it could be opened since I adapted one for use on an existing cord.\n38#Works great. Great quality for the price\n39#Perfect. Very easy to use. Bought a cheaper version of this 2 pack & wasted my money. Should've bought this one initially.\n40#Make sure you make your connections are good. Like it very well it's easy to install I use it for a wax warmer cord\n41#Work as advertised. I purchased these switches for a table lamp project. They work well and seem well constructed.\n42#Good buy. Used these to make a cool hanging lamp project, very happy with my purchase.\n43#Handles incadesent or LED loads. I'm actually using it to control the temperature of a coffee warming plate to warm honey in the jar to re-liquefy the honey.\n44#Description is wrong. It said on the ad that it was rated 150w for led and 600w for incandescent lights. But the unit says only 150w. I ran 300 watts and it melted. ✔Lighting Options: Use the Dimmer Switch for permanently installed lights with dimmable LED and CFL bulbs rated up to 150 watt LED/CFL and 600 watt incandescent\n45#gr8 deal, fast delivery! they served the purpose !\n46#Works as described. Works fine no issues\n47#Not really worth the price. They arrived on time and in mint new condition. They have heavy cord leads but the dimmer casing was on the cheap side, but still durable. I bought these quickly and upon doing more research I found a lot more that are cheaper and have a much higher wattage rating. So they work fine for the 120watt rating they provide and dim the lights very smoothly, just more better options are out there. I do recommend these dimmers only if your looking for this type and style, I do not recommend if your options are open to function over style to my family, friends, and all who read this review. I hope this review helps...Happy shopping!\n48#Good dimmers for the price...well made and smooth dimming. Good dimmers for the price...well made and smooth dimming with large dimming range",
