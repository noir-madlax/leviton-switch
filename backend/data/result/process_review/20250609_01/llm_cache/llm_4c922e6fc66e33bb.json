Disappears into the backsplash = perfect!\n2#Grey switch. Could not find item in grey at area stores. Very pleased\n3#Nice switch. Works well and nice looking\n4#Quality light switch. I’ve been going around my city looking everywhere for something similar to this, after receiving the light switch I was extremely pleased by the quality and durability of the light switch.\n5#Perfectly functional, but doesn't feel as nice as the single-switch versions. All in all, I can't complain too much. It's a perfectly cromulent solution for putting two switches into a single gang box (or one slot of a two-gang box). It does have removable tabs on both sides, and not every similar product does. This allows you to wire up two lights that are on two different circuits without issue - in my case an outdoor light and an outdoor outlet that are both switched from inside the house. It solves the problem fine and it's from a reputable brand so I'm confident that it will last. It's got some very minor issues. It is a bit bulky. It's not as deep as a GFCI receptacle for example, but it is thicker than a normal switch and this may impact fitment in older boxes. This is why I only gave four stars for ease of installation. The added girth, plus the fact that you're installing two pairs of wires into it means that things are going to get pretty cramped in an older box. The overall feel during operation just doesn't feel as nice as a typical decora switch, and it's hard to describe why. The click sound that it makes feels hollow and it has quite a bit of resistance when being toggled. It just feels a bit cheap. Which is a shame because it's not cheap at all - it's more expensive than the equivalent product with the old toggle style switches would be and it should feel similarly premium. Ultimately there just aren't many solutions on the market for single-gang multi switches in a decora style, especially in unusual colors. If that's what you need, it's probably the best out there. I'm certainly going to trust Leviton more than the unpronounceable gibberish brands that infect Amazon - at least I can be confident that this has proper UL certification and is up to code. For that reason alone, I recommend this over any product that isn't from a reputable major brand.\n6#Works well. I chose the gray color for my bathroom. It looks nice and so far works well.\n7#Very good. Very good thanks\n8#Works great. East install, perfect double switch for over sink light and under sink incenerator\n9#Exceeds my expectations. Quick delivery and great colr:\n10#Excellent service and product. Received items quickly. All uints work great. Thank you!\n11#A Perfect Match. I shopped Albuquerque from box hardware stores to electrical supply companies but could NOT find these rocker switches in Dove Gray anywhere! While waiting on remaining items on my list I went to Amazon on my phone & found exactly what I wanted! I placed my order with next day delivery. They are a perfect match with my quartzite counter tops & backsplash.\n12#Received right away. Was as decribed\n13#Love it. Couldn't find this at lowes and we were on a time crunch but luckily we found it on amazon and its working great!\n14#It works and upgrades the switches to a more modern look. Easy to install, I was living with a light that did not work until I had an electrician out for another reason. I thought I had to fix something in the atic but instead was told to change out the switch. Saw this switch and it works great. If you are upgrading to a more modern look this is the switch for you.\n15#Quality product. Exact match to the switch I needed to replace. Fast shipping and reasonable price.\n16#Excelente. Buena calidad\n17#Even color. It's fine it's a light switch\n18#Easy to install. We had some remodeling done on our bathroom. The bathroom originally had a separate switch for the fan and light, but the electrician, for whatever reason combined and placed them on one switch. This combination switch allowed for the one switch look, but also have dual functionality of operating each individually. Very easy to install as well.\n19#Amazon seems to be the only way to get the gray color. Installed in kitchen after the original broke after 14 years.\n20#De calidad. Fácil de instalar\n21#Standard switch. A little darker then I though\n22#Great Price! Great price and quality!\n23#Not available at Lowe’s or home depot. Excellent product\n24#It’s grey. It’s grey and exactly what I wanted\n25#Light switch. Smooth switch\n26#Good item. As expected\n27#Great! The product grate... I just hate when they leave it by the trash so far from the porch where people can Steal it!\n28#These a good for the money. I could only find this product\n29#It's a fluke! The switches don't work properly. The switches don't control different functions.\n30#Leviton gray matches Lutron gray. I used this to split up the lighting in a bath room. So the overhead chandelier light now goes to the top toggle and the vanity lights go to the bottom. I like that another gang did not have to be added to do this, since there was very limited room to add additional switches. The gray color is a very natural gray. The Leviton gray matches the Lutron gray very well, as long as both are glossy. I installed Lutron covers and dimmers with the Leviton switches and outlets (much cheaper). However, the GFCI I have is not the glossy gray and is a flat textured gray, so it does not match as well. I'm sharing the color observation, as I searched online and compared in stores to make sure the mixed brands would look good together. Not all other manufacturer grays match.\n31#Four Stars. works great\n32#Thank you good product. Thank you good product\n33#Usually very reliable. Switch came DOA which I found extremely unusual leviton is a very reliable Brand has been around for a very long time. I’ve never had a problem before but unfortunately this one wasn’t so good. Amazon refunded me immediately and I got a replacement that works perfectly.\n34#Five Stars. Item as expected.\n35#It is very well designed & functions well. The color of the switch matches the rest of the outlets that we had installed. It is very well designed & functions well. There is definite feedback when operating the switches, which helps with not having accidental operation of the switch. Installation was easy.\n36#Very nice and modern and easy to put. I was worried about the color but it is grey as it says. Very nice and modern and easy to put.\n37#A classic switch, and the gray really is Leviton gray. I hesitated to buy the gray version because the picture does not show classic Leviton gray, but I took a chance, and indeed it is gray. The previous Leviton switch failed (stuck on) after only ten years, but it's the first Leviton switch that has ever failed on me.\n38#Five Stars. I am very satisfied with the purchase, Works as described.\n39#A th room Complete. FINALLY. Got the color switch I needed. Couldn't find gray anywhere.\n40#Love it. Perfect color..just what I needed\n41#Happy to find this combo switch in Decora gray to ... Happy to find this combo switch in Decora gray to wire the bathroom fan and light without having to add a new box. As expected, the Leviton product is all quality as well.\n42#Got exactly as ordered. Was looking for a brushed ... Got exactly as ordered. Was looking for a brushed nickel switch. This comes in every color but brushed nickel or nickel. The gray stood out. Found a similar paint at a hobby store and painted the switch. Leviton should get nickel colored switches.\n43#Great brand. Works great. Clean look.\n44#Five Stars. exactly what i wanted\n45#Five Stars. Just what I wanted.",
