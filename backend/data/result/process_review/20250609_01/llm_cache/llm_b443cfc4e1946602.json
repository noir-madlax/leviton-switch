Switch worked as intended. Thanks.\n1#Good. Fast Shipping\n2#1 out of 2 switches worked. Iâ€™m an experienced installer, I hesitated to give these a try VS brands I know but I went ahead and ordered the 2 pack. One of the switches is defective and doesnâ€™t work and the other works fine. The one that works does well in low light settings and the on/off switch and dimmer slide are smooth operation but 50/50 chance of it working from my experience.\n3#Dimmer switch. Quality & value\n4#Rewriting my review. I initially gave this product a poor review but Iâ€™ve now discovered that the problem was a faulty light bulb. Replaced the bulb and the switch worked perfectly! But when I posted my initial review, the company immediately contacted me about how solve the problem. So now Iâ€™m impressed with the switch and their customer service.\n5#Works very well. Very easy to install, works as expected. Dimmer glide moves smoothly and effortlessly. Overall aesthetics are very good.\n6#easy installation. These were easy to install. When in came to the wiring, there seemed to be an extra red wire, which had one end taped up. If you needed it for a 3 way, you could have used it, but we only needed it for one switch. So we wired the ground, the red and the black to our existing wiring and it worked great. One we used to replace an older dimmer that was overheating and the other was a plain switch we added the dimmer to LED lights. The wiring does not have a lot of extra and it's pretty short, so you won't get to strip off much to expose more wire. These also felt very plastic, but they look good and both are working great. The buttons are a bit bulky, I know some of the other dimmers now have sleeker and low profiles, but this is good if you are trying to find the buttons in the dark. It was also very easy to put on the faceplate,. Overall, they work great.\n7#Really good value, work well. So far, I have installed one of the two dimmer switches in this pack in a bedroom with a single pole configuration. It works well. Within the last couple of years, I have installed three other dimmer switches around the house and these switches are almost identical in design to two of the switches. What is different about these is that they were a FAR better price. I had gotten all of the other ones at big box home improvement centers--where not only where the switches more expensive, but you also had to buy the switch plates separately, which added even more cost. The switches are also UL rated which is printed on the metal part of the switches.\n8#My overall experience with these dimmer switches has been excellent. I ordered this 2-pack of dimmer switches to replace a defective one in my laundry room. Since these dimmer switches met all the specifications, I decided to try this brand, My implementation was for single-pole operation. Installation was straightforward because I was replacing an existing switch. I like that these switches do not require a neutral wire because the installation is less invasive. These dimmers operate efficiently with a gentle rocker press, and the dimmer slide works smoothly. There was no flicker when adjusting the brightness. My overall experience with these dimmer switches has been excellent. If you are in the market for dimmer switches, you owe it to yourself to consider this product.\n9#Worked perfect for my application. We installed a new entry light to our hallway and it was much too bright. This dimmer switch fit all of our needs and it was simple to install. We wanted a switch that didn't require a neutral wire, had three-way switch capability and also had an integrated dimmer function. The depth of the switch is also relatively shallow for such a switch, and we had no trouble fitting everything back in the wall box when finished. A well designed switch that works well, what more could you ask for!\n10#First impressions are good. I have not gotten to the stage in my renovation to install these yet, but they look very nice with a good fit and finish. The dimmer has a smooth glide to it and the rocker is light and crisp. I will say they don't weigh much. That used to be the hallmark of quality, but not so much these days of modern electronics. I will report back if I find any issues.\n11#Works as intended! Installed with no issues, except that I wanted to connect a neutral too! ðŸ˜‰ Dims my halogen light as I wanted. Looks like unusual grounding to me, but I'm not an electrician. Update: I used another unit on a LED circuit - same good performance!",
