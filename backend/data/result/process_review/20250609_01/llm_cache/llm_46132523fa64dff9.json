After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Four Way Multi-Location Control Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Four Way Multi-Location Control Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment.

The color is off and does not match teh rest of their product and the rocker is hard to push and scrapes against the housing. I will order another set and see if they are any better.\n1#click, has a blue light, and lights flicker. Like the look, however I sometimes have to work with the adjuster to keep lights from flickering.\n2#Very poor quality. POOR QUALITY\n3#Color doesn't match other BESTTEN switched. I specifically purchased these four way light switches because they are the same manufacturer as the single pole and three way switches but unfortunately these four way switches do not match the same color. The 4 way switches also have a different feedback force and they looks slightly different as well. It's almost as if the four way switches are from another manufacturer.\n4#Color is off. I had purchased this 4-way switch from Bestten because my other switches I replaced were Bestten, Those products (single pole, 3-way switches and dimmers USWP4 or USP... this one said white, but compared to my other switches it looks gray. Bestten do you have 4-way switches that would better match? The 3-way switch-over-switch is not a Bestten product because I couldn't find any... Hopefully Bestten will have some option for me on this product. Otherwise - all products have worked fine.\n5#Doesn't match the other Bestten switches. Ordered the same white as my other switches and it doesn't match. Shown next to it is the same brand and 'color'",
