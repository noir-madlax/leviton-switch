These switches are JUNK do not buy. I have had to go back and change them all out to new, the rocker switch breaks and will not stay on.\n1#1/2 of the switches have failed in less than 4 months. 3 of the 12 in the box did not work from the beginning. 3 more failed within 4 months of installation. That's a 50% failure rate. Very dissatisfied with the quality. Return window was closed before I had them installed. Hopefully the seller will reach out and make things right.\n2#Easy home improvement update of old light switches. Easy installation and covers with no visible screws made this option a great upgrade to all the light switches in our house. I replaced all the old model switches in very little time and have modernized the look of the switches from the old fashioned style.\n3#Functional. The [12 Pack] MOES Paddle Rocker Light Switch offers a reliable and stylish solution for controlling lights in your home. With a 15Amp 120V capacity, these switches are perfect for most standard electrical needs.

The pack of 12 is ideal for larger projects, providing excellent value for the price. Overall, a great choice for those looking to update their light switches with a simple and functional design.\n4#Amazing. I loved them! They are of great quality.\n5#1 out of 4 are bad.

My husband is an electrical and he also said that it has good quality.\n8#Quality control. Disappointed in these switches. I’ve installed 7 of them and so far 3 have been faulty. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone\n9#Good one. Good quality product. you get a good price for a package. Wanted to upgrade mine. This was a good choice.\n10#Chinese junk. These look nice and have a great price but you get what you pay for. 2 of the 12 went bad after 30 days.\n11#Don't buy. Don't buy. At least 7 out of 10 switches have bad contact problem.
