Box had been opened and taped shut on the bottom. Install instructions and screws were missing.\n1#Didnâ€™t last 3 monthsâ€¦Iâ€™d love to hear from the company to get a refund ! Very disappointed. This switch just stopped working this morning, didnâ€™t even last three months, it was supposed to work for the dimmable LEDs that I have. Very disappointed with that would love customer support to contact me and either refund my money or send me out something thatâ€™ll last\n2#My Led light flashed. My LEDs dimmable lights flashed at the low setting. I guess this dimmer is not comparable. Otherwise works ok.\n3#Very Nice Dimmer. After replacing my bedroom LED ceiling lights with CREE high-hats, I experienced LED ghosting. So I replaced my dimmer switch with this Lutron dimmer and 'bam' it fixed my problem. I've used Lutron dimmers before in my whole home and they are the best. Easy to install if you are a little handy. Lots of tutorials on Youtube. It took me 15-20 min to install. I am very meticulous about everything being staright and aligned so I took my time. Make sure to use the ground wire and you probably want to disconnect your circuit breaker to avoid being shocked. I didn't cause I'm a pro and extremely careful, but just as a precaution you probably should. Anyway, very high end quality dimmer. Would not buy anything else. Good Luck!\n4#Poor quality control. Ordered over 50 of these, got a dozen 2way dimmers instead of 3ways. Canâ€™t return them now because I bought them early for a job. Quality control is poor. These are useless to me and had to fork out more money to get the quantity I needed\n5#Easy Install. Works great and really easy install..\n6#Very pleased with this! Fits well and operates perfectly, doesnâ€™t break the bank and itâ€™s well built.\n7#Great product. Came quickly except I ordered it with the plate and that wonâ€™t come for a couple weeks so Iâ€™m trying to figure out how to cancel the plate. I use the existing one I had. Itâ€™s easy to install. Thereâ€™s a video that you can go to and it shows you how to install it very easy and Iâ€™m very happy with the way it works\n8#Good. I had the same switch for years in my dining room that didn't have the ability to use LEDs. When that old one started having issues, I switched to this one. It took less than 10 minutes to do.\n9#Installed. Still working as of now\n10#Exactly as I expected. You know when you order things off Amazon and you thinkâ€¦. I hope this works outâ€¦ well. I expected the switch not to workâ€¦ however I was pleasantly surprised. It actually was the correct one and worked splendidly. Saved almost $200 to what the handyman said it would cost.\n11#Great light switch, easy to install. Well built and easy to install. Works well with the LED lights.\n12#Works beautifully! Had to replace the one in my bedroom because the other one wouldnâ€™t dim correctly. Works like itâ€™s supposed to. Easy to hook up, only took a few minutes. I recommend.\n13#On/off Switch could be a little larger. Easy to follow instructions. Always be sure power is turned off at the breaker box before working on anything like this. Protect yourself for your sake and the sake of your family :)\n14#Excellent product. As advertised\n15#Works very well. Works very well - very bright to dim, as you like, and an off/on switch.\n16#Demmi. My husband installed these said they were great good product definitely recommend decent price also\n17#It's perfect. I originally went with a GE rotary dimmer switch. It worked fine, but unless you pressed the button exactly dead center, you would change the dimming values. Not a problem with this one, as it has a separate On/Off switch. Very smooth dimming and feels like quality.\n18#Works Perfectly. I replaced the incandescent light bulbs in my chandelier with LED bulbs. Using the old dimmer the bulbs flickered horribly. I replaced the old dimmer with this newer LED dimmer which was very easy to install. The flickering is completely gone and the dimmer works perfectly.\n19#Adjustable. Yes its a dimmer but it also has an adjustment to preset the minimum low setting\n20#Excellent LED dimmer for the Halo HLB6 Recessed Canless lights. Did quite a bit of reading to ensure that this Lutron Dimmer would be compatible and work with the 6 HALO HLB 6 inch Recessed LED Ceiling & Shower Disc Light â€“ Canless Ultra Thin Downlight â€“ 5 CCT Selectable - White - 6 Pack. Happy to report, the dimmer works really really well, perfect ability to control the lights from 0 - 100% brightness, no issues. I'll be purchasing at least 1, if not 2 more of these as I install some more Halo 6 inch Recessed Canless Disc lights.\n21#Works great. Installed in our kitchen in combination with new LED dimmable lights. Well made, easy to install. Works so well, no flickering at all. For those who might have issues, thereâ€™s a regulator inside, a little blue tab on the left. We set ours halfway. Love the toggle switch since you know for sure if itâ€™s on or off. We bought more to update other rooms.\n22#Product arrived exactly as described. Great company excellent electrical products. Great durable and quality.\n23#Bought used and it did not work. Going to see if Amazaon will refund me. Bought used and it did not work.\n24#Made just right. I need to replace the little knob and I t work great\n25#Qualty - designed to adjust for flicker! Purchased my first LED light fixture and a review recommended this switch. So glad I bought it! My house is over 70 years old and comes with issues every time I update. This switch has an easy to understand video and explains how to adjust if you have a flicker! Love it. Well worth it.\n26#this thing was gross ðŸ¤¢. the item came it was bought new. first was the wrong color second it has definitely been installed before. it has gunk and grime all over it. the wires are stripped and worn. the label is so old on the back it's worn and falling off.\n27#Suitable for LED under counter lighting. I used this switch to replace a similar five year old Lutron switch, which had started flickering at low light levels. The new one works like a charm. Possibly improvements to switch? At any rate, I like it.\n28#Great way to add simple dimming. Sleek 3-way switch with dimmer. Easy to install if you actually read the instructions. Adjustable dimming range helps for older LEDs. The BLACK wire is the traveler. For some reason, I assumed it was the wire with stripe on it and had to rewire. Don't be an idiot like me.\n29#Works as Advertised. Purchased this dimmer for use with a chandelier. My old dimmer wasn't compatible with the LED dimmable bulbs I had placed in the chandelier to replace incandescent bulbs. With this new dimmer, the LEDs no longer flicker.\n30#Nice dimmer for my new LED 1x2 Panel. My bedroom needed a ceiling light to replace the old flickering fluorescent one. I went with an LED panel for their low cost and excellent light quality. I wanted a dimmer for the new panel and went with the Lutron Skylark because of its reputation. I'm not easy to please but I couldn't be happier with my new setup.\n31#Easy to use. Easy to navigate. For a lot of people the slider on the front is easier to reach your light level than side slider.\n32#Not Sure. Not sure if it is the light or the switch. It is the one the light maker recommended but it does not dim much before the lights start flickering.\n33#Very easy to install. Iâ€™ve only ever install light switches with the connectors on the side, never the wires in the back. Game changer. I have a 1940â€™s cape and while my break box is new, not all the wiring is. The wiring in the back made connecting to the thick knob and tube wiring was a breeze. While perfectly safe unless disturbed, I hate knob and tube wiring. The installation went smooth and I greatly appreciated the adjustment knob for led flickering. Iâ€™m going to get new bulbs that are approved by Lutron but overall Iâ€™m happy with the process. Itâ€™s very basic which is exactly what I was looking for. Iâ€™m tired of smart home products that constantly disconnect and will be obsolete in 5 years.\n34#Trailing edge dimmers are recommended for use with LED bulbs. Dimmers use phase control of the AC waveform. They stay off for part of the cycle and turn on for the rest of it. This happens 120 (or 100) times a second because each cycle has a positive and negative peak. Leading edge dimmers are the older type. They will work with all incandescents, transformers for low voltage halogens, and some LEDs. They start each half cycle on and switch off somewhere in the middle of a cycle. Trailing edge dimmers are the newer type. They will work with all incandescents and most dimmable LED bulbs. They start each half cycle off and switch on somewhere in the middle of a cycle.\n35#Okay, but. . . Dimmer does not include the plate that surrounds it. I thought it was a complete package, but had to make a trip to the hardware store to buy the plate to complete installation.\n36#No more flickering! I bought these to replace Lutron CTCL 153P dimmers which were about 12 years old. Those old dimmers would flicker if you turned them off and then turned them back on. I am happy to report that this new version works very well with LED cans and eyeballs. So happy.\n37#Trusted brand. I needed this to replace a very old dimmer which had intermittent performance issues with LED bulbs. This Lutron dimmer was made with LED's in mind and works flawlessly.\n38#Just what I needed. Easy to install and just what I needed for the dimmable lights that were too bright.\n39#Very good product. I was duped by the photo and thought I was getting two when it's only one. My bad for not reading full description. I spent more than I wanted for one unit. Good product though,\n40#It works. This dimmer switch works great on LED lights terrific I'm very pleased with it for the price also.\n41#Eliminated jitter. The incandescent lights burned out, and I replaced with LED. The jittery lights were driving me bonkers! It was either an on-off switch, or this dimmer made for LEDs. Jitter gone!\n42#Easy to install. The switch with a dimmable slider has a user-friendly design, offering easy installation without any technical background. Its clear and intuitive interface makes adjusting light levels easy, providing customization for any mood or occasion.\n43#Na. Swicth works great\n44#Easy install, smooth action. The switch was easy to install with clear instructions, has a quality feel in the switch and slider. I like the ability to be a single or 3-way switch. Does the job.\n45#Very easy to install. It took only minutes. I was VERY happy with the ease of installation, how I can now use LED bulbs and how bright the light is now!\n46#Great replacement! This switch was a great replacement for an old one that had seen better days, and the price was very reasonable.\n47#Use the right switch for the job. To dim my LED puck lights\n48#Great product. Super popular product I have seen it on every house I go It works Durable Looks good\n49#Worked fine but. We realized that a toggle switch would be more convenient and fumbling around for the tiny switch. Just get the rectangular toggle switch with the slide dimmer on the side instead. These will annoy you just a little bit.",
