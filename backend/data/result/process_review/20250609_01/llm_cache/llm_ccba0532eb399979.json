Does not shine outward into a person's eyes. Make sure you have enough room in the electrical box as this is larger than a standard light switch.\n1#0/10. Product didn't even work.\n2#WORKS GREAT. WORKS GREAT\n3#Easy to operate and install. Made of durable material. Worked as intended quick dispatch and delivery a bit noisy when push by finger but provide a bit light not enough keep you awake Suttle I certainly recommend this switch easy to install.\n4#Nice switch/lights! This switch is very nice and the lights are bright.\n5#Work as advertised. Easy to install, works fine. Of note: the LED light fixture in the powder room I used this in lights just a little. I guess it is below the minimum required to keep it from lighting. However, it only lights a few of its LED diodes not all of them so just a little more light in this very dark room. I purchased several more of these.\n6#Innovative, nightlight type switch. I like the look of this contemporary switch. Other illuminated switches seem to have a black cluster appearance. This has a tech look to it and has five rectangular LED segments at the top that emit white light. I imagine you could put the lights aiming downwards if you prefer with a single pole action would be opposite. It would be great if they made a three-way switch as well. But the photocell on the switch, we can see the little hole for it works well. It is so useful in trying to find a light switch in the dark. Seems to be on average quality with any other switch you can buy in a big box Store. Not spec grade however, good for residential.\n7#Night light switch. They are ok, but the light on them are not bright you can't really see at night.\n8#Not worth your time. This led night light switches stopped working after four months. No customer service number available. One switch stopped working no light.\n9#Disappointed. We bought this Dec. 2, 2023 and now it‚Äôs Sept. 21, 2024, not even a year later, and the nightlight part has already quit working. It was great while it was working. I didn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúhunt‚Äù for the light switch when I wanted to turn on the light and, plus, it was a great nightlight for going to the bathroom in the middle of the night. I really expected it to last a lot longer than this, especially with it being electric and not battery operated. Very disappointing!\n10#Awesome. Incredible amount of light for the small area where the lights are. Shines up or down, which is nice so you can orient the switch whichever way you want. The day/night sensor (the tiny hole in the switch) is sensitive. Sometimes walking past will make the light come on, but no big thing. Now I don't have to try to walk around in the dark!\n11#Install was not normal. I‚Äôm used to light switches installed where pushing to top in turns it on and the lower end to turn the light off. These have to be installed upside down to that to have the LEDs pointing down. They will work well either way.\n12#I love them... A few days after installation one appears dimmer than the other but still they work great. Make sure your electrician installs the correctly, my electrician wasn't paying attention and installed them with the light facing up instead of down the way I wanted. Still, they are a great little night light. I plan to buy more for other areas of the house.\n13#Nice-useful product 2 in 1 really. Nice for those hallways that need lights or lamps to light up why not light switch‚Äôs baby can‚Äôt tear off!\n14#Easy installation. Liked the quick shipping and easy installation; provides enough light but not too much; great product\n15#These do NOT have lights... We had these installed... they do not have lights... the box stated they had lights... only way to get your money back is to have them uninstalled and send them back... I'm not happy with their solution\n16#Great. Easy install. Bathroom night light\n17#Good, Easy to Install but not UL Listed. Good, Easy to Install but not UL Listed. I have had no issues but in hindsight I would pay more for a UL listed/inspected switch.\n18#The screw colors dont match standard. Usually black to brass neutral to white. This switch doesnt follow that standard.\n19#Great device, just what we needed. I saw this and thought it would solve the issue we have in our bath. I did not want a night light in the hallway as I like it dark. This worked as it does not have too much light, just the right amount on the wall in the bath. The only thing is you have to get use to the rocker switch being in the opposite direction than the norm. It is a great product and recommend it.\n20#works great. Works great. Not only does it help you find the switch, it is also a nice night light. The light LEDs are located in the top of the switch toggle (see pictures) which projects the light up the wall and reflex off of the ceiling.\n21#A must have. Very easy to install and looks great for any room\n22#Light switch. Nice night light\n23#Not as bright as advertised but, still good. My light switch is in a room that has a skylight but, is very dark at night. I liked this product because i believed it would help at night but not keep the LED lights on all day like some other models (bathroom light switches for instance). My only complaint is that i wish the light sensor was a little better. I sometimes find it on around 3pm when there is enough light in the room. My expectation was that it would only turn on at little (5pm-6pm) to no light. The LED lights are not as bright as advertised but, still good. Actually prefer it because when i get up to use the bathroom at night, the light is not as bright, as say a iphone flash light.\n24#Not very bright. Simple to install , no need for a neutral. It passes through the light bulb.\n25#Exactly as pictured and described. I love it when what I order from Amazon arrives and is ACTUALLY exactly as expected! I think we've all experienced - at LEAST once - the disappointment that comes of receiving your order and, although it does look like the pictures, just isn't *quite* how you were expecting it to be. So it was very satisfying when it turned out that this one looks like and functions precisely as anticipated. I wholeheartedly believe in giving credit where it's due (not just complaints and dissatisfaction) so I'm giving my üëçüëç two thumbs up and ü´° solute of approval to the manufacturer as well as yourself, the inquiring, potential customer that this product is üëå A-OK.\n26#:Light switch works great on dark staircase. :Light switch works great on dark staircase. Works exactly how I needed it to, coming up the stairs of a dark stairway. Plenty of light with dark wood stairs with a bit of reflection.\n27#Very cool switches for a garage or shop. These work perfectly when going out to my dark garage.\n28#Works as described! Bought these for a half bathroom so that guests can easily see the switch. Works pretty good, hope it lasts. Super easy install just like a regular switch.\n29#Wonderful way to light your way! Just the right amount of light illuminating the wall for you to see in the dark.\n30#To Dark. To dark making the switch worthless.\n31#Wonderful! I installed one switch in a bathroom. Provides enough light at night that we don't have to switch the lights on. Installed the second switch in an alcove where the entry to our garage is, and similarly provides enough light at night when walking around. Very happy with these, as well as the 3-way switches from same manufacturer.\n32#Switch works but issue with brightness. **buyers beware** The LED light on this switch is way too dark. Unable to see anything. Highly advise to reconsider buying this switch for replacement of an actual night light. Thankfully this does not apply for me, as I need a new switch regardless.\n33#Perfect amount of light for middle of the night. Mount upside down. Great quality switch. Light is mounted on the top edge of the switch, so you'll want to mount it upside down so that the light illuminates the ground rather than the ceiling which blinds you when you want to switch on the lights.\n34#Love these things. Have trouble with dark bathroom, these things solved my problem. Now have a decent night light without the expense of an electrician to put in an outlet‚Ä¶so easy to install!\n35#One switch was defective. Purchased a two pack of these switches and one was defective and unsafe. My electrician would not install, he said current was passing thru switch in the off position.\n36#Perfect glow. We added these to the bathrooms at our VRBO rental so guests could find their way in the dark in an unfamiliar place. Super easy to install and they provide the perfect glow without being so bright that it disrupts your sleep cycle\n37#Upside down and noisy. The switches are opposite of how typical switches are designed, this is by design because of the light. It just seems odd. They work well but are very loud.\n38#I really shouldn't be suprised. This seemed like a great buy for the price to help with a dark hallway but the first fell apart when my friend who is a electrician was installing. He said he wouldn't feel comfortable having something like that in his house and advised me to go to the store and buy on other than installing the second one.\n39#Cool ! My mom needed a little light, a little something so she could get a drink of water in the middle of the night. This works absolutely perfect. Just enough for her to see the floor in front of her on her way to the kitchen. Best part she doesn't have to turn the light on that she finds too bright. Installation was simple and fit a standard switch cover so I didn't have to buy a new one of those. Can't speak to longevity but I will update if any issues come up. I would recommend these.\n40#Great night light. Perfect slim design. Unobtrusive lights. Perfect brightness.\n41#LED lites burn out quickly 3 months. led lites stopped working about 3 months of use. Save your money not worth the cost.\n42#Light Shines ‚ÄúUp‚Äù by Default. Our bathroom switches are about a foot down the wall from the door, so we always fumbled to find the switch. Now with this illuminated switch, we can easily find it in the dark. The LEDs aren‚Äôt too bright at night (which is a plus), but they‚Äôre visible enough to find in the dark. My only issue was getting the LED to fire downward. So I removed the switch from the metal surround and flipped it. Not thrilled about it, since all the wires are on the same side now, but it works the way I want it ¬Ø\\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø\n43#easy install. I like it, i put one in each bathroom as a night light\n44#Not what‚Äôs advertised. The picture shows night like shining from bottom but the night shines from the top. It‚Äôs not installed upside down the on position is like a normal light switch only difference is the night like illuminates towards the ceiling. If you try to reverse it the switch the on position is opposite a normal switch. I should have returned it.\n45#Wonderful night light. It's better than a night light.\n46#Hang them upside down to get the light to shine down. Only problem is that the light shines too bright when hung correctly. So hang them upside down. It‚Äôs no different than what a 3-way switch is on one end, with it appearing off but it‚Äôs switching down to turn lights on\n47#Motion detectors not working, couple of switches not working. Some of the switches are poor quality mechanics are not good. Sensors are not working. Instructions are not clear. Over all I would not suggest this to anyone",
