So far unimpressed, I have to return one switch because it only stays on and will not turn off. The other switch functions on and off but does not dim the lights at all. Haven’t tried the app yet but I got these switches as they said they were required for the cync hd under cabinet lights to properly dim. Feeling annoyed that I have to troubleshoot these issues. Hopefully customer service can turn this one around.\n1#Faulty? The switch will not turn my light off. It seems as if the circuit is always closed and the switch doesn’t break the circuit. Will be getting a hold of customer service to sort this out if the product is faulty.\n2#I like these. I've installed quite a few of these switches. They are easy to install and programming is fairly simple. Also, GE offers good support, if you need it\n3#Wish this was better designed. A couple of things. The mounting is finicky. You stick the works to the wall with tape. Mind you, you will have to pry it off to reset or replace the battery. Bad design. Philips has a dimmer stuck with magnets to the mount. Easy to work with. The button config. Weird. The working bits, rocker switches I guess, are crammed together. There’s more space to work with that would allow for better operation. I had to reset the device after removing the battery tape. Was NOT in setup mode so had to remove mounting plates to reset. Mounting plates. They do not end up flush with the wall. Design did not allow for tape thickness so it floats away from the wall it is mounted to. More bad design. ONLY works with cync app. No compatibility with Apple Home that can see.\n4#Overall Good but a few Little Things. The switch works great with apps like google home and Alexa but the Cync app itself is not great. Also beware when buying this Iswitch with other Cync switches as they sometimes look different with varying light brightnesses.\n5#Terrible! Very slow to respond and you have to press the button perfectly. App is terrible and doesn’t you to set timers. You can only turn lights on and off at set times of a day but can’t set lights to turn off after a certain amount of time. Constantly lose wifi connection.\n6#Light ring is to bright. I find that the light ring around the button is way too bright in a dark room. I wish it could be dimmed. If you have two or three switches next to one another you could read a book.\n7#Junk. Worst purchase period. Complete waste of money. Nothing to do with seller, just product.\n8#Really pretty useless. According to Cync tech support these smart switches aren't smart enough to control a switched outlet. They only seem to work with Cyncs limited line of output options. I couldn't get these lights to turn off completely, off isn't really off. Anything attached is still going to have small voltage going to it. Save your money smart home tech is not yet available to the average consumer.\n9#These switches fail with a simple overvoltage condition. I had a power outage and my generator cord went bad with an open neutral that caused a 165 VAC voltage surge on one side of the breaker panel. Every one of the Cync switches (9 switches) on that side of the breaker panel was taken out. I can see them failing with a lightning strike, but not 165 VAC. I'm very ticked off that all the switches failed. With an average cost of $25 each, that's $225 that I'm out. Not only that, but a few spare Cync switches I had could not be programmed with the app while my internet was out. My LAN wireless internet was working, but the switches could not be programmed without Internet access. The problem is that these switches can't be connected to a hub like Home Assistant. At this point instead of wasting more money for low quality Cync products, I'm will get different switches compatible with Home Assistant to eliminate the problems I'm having now. I'm going to tell people to stay away from Cync products. From my experience, they are pure junk.\n10#Simply works as expected. I don't need much from a smart light switch. Just that it works, turns the lights on and off, dims, and allows me to use it from my phone. Sounds great right? I tried two other \"smart\" switches before this one, first from Tapo, then from Kasa, and they simply didn't work at all. No amount of troubleshooting and following tech support's instructions would make them pair properly. But this one from GE? Flawless! Immediate and easy connectivity right out of the box. No hassle. Sure, it cost three times as much as those various TP-Link sub-branded ones, but they don't work at all, and this one does. So I'm pretty happy with it.\n11#Ordered new dimmer switches and received used ones. I ordered and paid for new dimmer switches and three of the boxes were opened and re-taped. I’m Not happy about that at all! We didn’t realize it until it was time to install them. Let’s hope they work!!!\n12#It absolutely blows my mind that these simply DO NOT work with SmartThings. If you're trying to add these to a smarthome with Samsung SmartThings, keep it moving. They don't even recognize on the app. Bring the original GE Embrighten switches back. Otherwise, I guess the switch works with the button push, but doesn't slow on/slow off like the old ones and dimming doesn't seem to work out of the box (maybe a GE app configuration that I just won't do).\n13#Warning! Two switches on the same circuit turn each other on and off. Major issue. If you put two on the same circuit, and turn one on, the other will go on, turn one off, the other goes off. This is manually. I have another pair as a closet and bedroom overhead. It is doing the same thing. Turn on one and they both go on. They now can’t be separated. Sucks because now I have un install four switches and through them away. got it going. But it’s not easy. About thirty minutes on the wires. The app was hard. You have to download the app to make it work with Alexa. I was hoping like the Gr smart plugs it would just work. Signing on the app was a pain. First it kept jumping out of the create accounts page. So it took a long time plus a couple of restarts. Finals did. And they demand an email. Then you have to put it in twice and verify it with a number. They really really want that email. Man. Because lord knows if someone hacks your account they could turn your lights on and off. Ooooo. Oh no. Not that. Then you have to get it to find the switch. Took about four times Now you have to get alexia to talk to their app. They have a button that says. Connect to alexia. Takes a long time to find it. Just fyi I have installed about 100 alexa plugs and switch since 2018. Now it still won’t work. You will have to activate the skill. So games and skills. Search. Now you can put it in groups. So my entire afternoon to get ONE switch hooked up. It does work. I need about twenty switches for my house. I’m looking for switches that worked with alexia with out an app like the ge plugs. I guess I will keep looking. Last the reviews on the Alexa skills are brutal. One star one star one star. People say it just stopped working. I had this happen with Lexington in my last home. They wanted me to update my password. Pissed me off. Like I have time for that. Besides that. The quality of the ge plugs and switches have been substantial. So far.\n14#Trash. Does not connect to Wi-Fi. This product is absolute trash, and do not waste your money by buying it. You have been warned! John, I am fairly technical and understand, in-depth networking, no matter what I tried the switch would not connect to Wi-Fi. I reached out to the customer service, who were very helpful but led me on a wild goose chase. I spent countless hours on the phone and through email each time they gave me another dead end to follow which took up a lot of time. The result was the same. it would not connect to Wi-Fi or recognize my system. I mistakenly bought three of these, and all three went into the trash do not buy!\n15#Frustrating. I have used these before and they have been finicky, but this time they just wouldn't hook up. Very frustrating.\n16#Don't trust the description. Doesn't work in my house and amazon will not take a return for it.\n17#Excellent product! Easy to set up and fully featured. TL;DR: excellent product. They have thought of everything. Easy to set up and link with Google Home. Long version: I had bought a WiFi switch from a different manufacturer before this one. It was very frustrating as the app for the switch would insist I pick a 2.4GHz SSID even though I had (but my phone connects on the same SSID on 5GHz.). So before I ordered this one, I decided to talk to GE Customer Support. After talking to them for this product I decided to buy and try it out. And I was ready to do some tricks for the WiFi set up if the app had problems like the other manufacturers product which I will not name here. Anyhow long story short this switch was a breeze to set up. I did not have to do anything special with the WiFi setup. I entered the SSID and the password while my phone was connected to the same SSID on 5GHz. It worked first time. In a couple of minutes I was controlling it with Google Home and had a schedule set up. One of the things I was worrying about was the fact that this switch is a dimmer as well. But the special LED bulbs I have are not dimmable , so I was worried it may cause an issue. But during the set up process the app asked me what type of bulb it was and whether it was dimmable! So my worries were for nothing, they had thought about this detail and app knows to drive the switch so that it only has On/Off and not brightness etc. Product is very appealing and feels really high quality. My only issues was the depth of the switch. It took some work to get it to fit in the box in the wall with all the wires and wire nuts there as well. Packaging detail: I noticed that the box case for the product has a magnetic flap. I thought was kind of neat but excessive. Could have saved some cost there.\n18#Burned out after three months. It connected to the Wi-Fi easily and worked well for three months powering two GE 60W equivalent led bulbs. Then one day I turned it on and heard a quick buzzing sound then POP. Now it cannot turn the lights on (but it still connects to Wi-Fi). Customer support was not helpful. Super disappointed…\n19#Won't work with an LED fixture. Very nice switch. It was easy to install with clear, well written instructions. My challenge was with the fixture I was connecting. I have an outdoor coach light which is all LED. The switch includes an adaptor for a standard socket but there is no way to use that with a fixture that has no socket. I moved it to another location in the house and am thrilled with how well it works.\n20#Not a dimmer switch! I previously purchased this switch and it worked great so I purchased another. Unfortunately after having the new one installed I realized, despite ordering a dimmer switch, this one did not dim. While the option to return is available, the cost to have an electrician come back to remove this and then install a replacement would exceed the cost of the switch. Be careful when you order this that the correct item is sent. The boxing is nearly identical.\n21#Great Item. This is a very nice switch to add to your home automation. Works great in your phone or with Alexa. Very easy to install and setup.\n22#Changed out our whole house. Very nice looking. Easily integrated with Alexa. The lit led circle looks sharp and serves as a just enough of a night light and makes it easy to find your light switch in the dark. Way to dim or brighten. Good value, less than competitive brands and functions better, from my perspective.\n23#I love these switches. I love these switches. Single pole install really easy. Dual or more pole get a electrician.\n24#Find another brand. I have 48 of these formerly-C-by-GE/now-called-Cync wired switches of varying on/off, on/off/dim, on/off/dim/motion. Do not use the 3 wire variety. The aggravation and unreliability is not worth it. The four wire with a neutral required is the way to go off you're going to elect to use this line of smart switches. Seriously consider another brand, however. Here's what I don't like about them. 1.) You can't tell by simply looking at the switch whether or not the light is on in the room that it controls light if that's behind a closed door, like say, your garage. 2.) When you press the switch manually it often does not turn on or turn off if you don't press it precisely squarely in the middle. This is aggravating when you walk by. The reattempts are many and a pain in A with these switches. 3.) It's gotten better but in the beginning, programming these switches was often a problem if not an impossibility. To function smartly these switches must communicate with the cloud and...well...Cync runs an unreliable cloud in their data center. 4.) The Cync app is unbelievably stupid. It was designed by somebody who has no Smarthome smarts. 5.) When wiring up these switches, they are far too easy to fry. They have no tolerance whatsoever for any error, however minor. 6.) They are pricey at around $50. Ridiculously so. 7.) Despite having the ability for the light-ring in the switch to emit white, red, blue, or green, you can't program the switch to display any colors other than white. 8.) You can't program the motion-sensing switch to automatically turn off after leaving the room IF you first manually turned on the switch. 9.) You can't program the motion sensing switch to not turn on automatically and blind you at certain times of the middle of night like when you get up to go to the bathroom. 10.) The WiFi capability of these switches only work on the overcrowded 2.4GH spectrum and require a SUPER powerful and ultra efficient router, an expensive one, in order to work as reliably as possible.\n25#Works Well/Minor Installation Issue. The dimmer switches were easy to wire up, program, and connect to Alexa and Google. The one issue I had is my switches are going into a metal 1900 box with a 2-gang mud-ring. Two dimmers do not fit in this mud-ring. I ordered a plastic mud-ring that I believe will work.\n26#Dont Work. Bought 2 of These from separate retailers [Lowes] Neither of them worked correctly.\n27#Didn’t work with remote. I never got it to work with the remote it’s supposed to work with. I even tried a second remote. I ended up returning all of it.\n28#Awesome form and function. I purchased and installed this switch over the weekend. It was simple to install in an un-crowded box...only took 10 minutes or so. The switch looks awesome. I could probably see myself installing these throughout the entire house.\n29#These are cool. I like being able to control from the cync app. Connecting a 3 way toggle was a little tricky, because the nuetral wire was tucked/hidden for me.\n30#Very nice smart switch. I really like this product - it was reasonably easy to install and works well. Pairing with the app was a little challenging, but I got through it. Also, the inability to set a schedule unless you're Bluetooth-connected to it (near it) was unexpected. Having worked with other \"Smart\" devices (outlets, Nest, etc.), you can do things like updating schedule remotely, as long as the device is already connected to a network. Not so with this switch - you have to be close to it.\n31#Good design, bugs in app. Good design, looks elegant. Found bugs in the APP, called customer service, but cannot be solved for a year! Device schedule in the motion detection settings does not work.\n32#What's wrong? Anyone knows what's wrong, why can't control when Bluetooth is off or when I leave home? I followed the setup guide step by step for all 12 dimmer switches, but only 1 can be controlled when BT is off or when I leave home, the rest 11 switches failed. How to solve this headache, because I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times, still can't get all switches working properly when leave home. 4-wired model with neutral wire connected.\n33#I Should Have Listened to the Reviews. In the description of the product it says that the dimmer would work if you have existing ge smart bulbs when turned off. After an hour with the ge customer service nothing would work. Wouldn't recommend.\n34#Functions as promised. Found my house wiring to be quite different from what was specified in instructions. Got excellent support from GE tech support. They told me which wires to connect together even though they were different colors. I wanted this so I could dim the lights in my home theater using Alexa. Works great.\n35#Tried nearly all of them, ended up with 4-wire design. I originally had a 3-wire switch that seemed to work just fine, except in my application. Let me explain. I replaced my ceiling fan which is deemed to be \"smart\". Nowadays that means some form of app control, but really only mean there is no wall switch and only a remote. It does have an LED light kit and that's where the 3-wire Cync switch ran into problems. Namely, it seems to condition the power on the load wire in a way that disabled (permanently off) the light kit. And you have to use it in line with the load wire in order to power the unit, which it draws from the difference created by the load. Bypassing the switch solved that problem, but not my needs of using the wall switch position for a switch to turn the Cync light strips (indirect lighting) on/off. Sure a solution would have been to go with a wireless switch, just that this version doesn't support Alexa and most importantly doesn't feature the glow ring which I quickly grew attached to. In my situation, the wall switch previously powered outlets until I repurposed it to power my old fan. Hence, I had a neutral wire to work with and that enables the use of the 4-wire version. My inquiries about that application returned generally that the load wire still is needed and therefore it's unlikely that the 4-wire version is the solution. However, when reviewing the specs it turns out that the neutral wire (in addition to the line) provides a closed circuit and it's a bit unclear what the load wire does (other than providing to a light fixture albeit not controlling it). For my needs, I tried to simply connect the wires to the available line and neutral, but not use the load wire as that was already bypassed (to mentioned fan). According to Cync, the Load wire is mandatory, even in the 4-wire design. Then again, unlike the 3-wire version, there is no minimum load requirement, which technically means it could be 0W or even open. It sure confirmed to be true and once I wired neutral and line to the switch, it booted up even with the load wire (red) disconnected. Problem solved! The switch is recognized by the app, and controls my CYNC full color light strips as intended. The brightness control works well, too. And of course the soft glow ring around the switch is there, too. A positive side effect is that apparently the 4-wire dimmer switch is currently on sale for $29 whereas the 3-wire version costs more. The latter is theoretically more versatile, but may affect devices on the load wire more than desired. Hence, if there is a white (neutral) wire, the 4-wire switch works better for me.\n36#Buy a different brand. The switch itself is fine. The thing is you buy a smart dimmer for the remote control, and this app is unreliable as they come. I regularly need to disable the Alexa skill and add it again which also means reconfiguring routines. The cync app doesn't log you in half the time so you basically have to walk up to the switch to turn it on and off which is impossible if you have a timer for the dog cause you're not home before dark.\n37#Very disappointing. Very difficult to syn with your smartphone. It wants Bluetooth, wifi, GPS location and an email account to set up. Frequent lost my settings and connection with home wifi, makes a high pitch buzzing noise and the App is poorly designed. Uninstalling after a year of attempts to simply get my porch lights to turn on and off at a set time reliably.\n38#Looks over functionality. Pros: Nice design, looks great in the dark, connects to wifi Cons: App is terrible, wifi connection isn't stable, poor functionality with Google ecosystem\n39#Were great, now terrible because of connectivity problems. I’ve had multiple of these for a while now and they were great, even got one for my brother. Then GE sold the business to savant and ever since then the connectivity has become completely unreliable. This week alone their servers have gone down multiple times and when it comes back online I’ve had to reconfigure everything. My brother has they had issues. Such a disappointment but the new company ruined it.\n40#Let there be light. About 45 min install and setup w/intermediate electrical skills. Upgrade from traditional toggle to smart dimmer. Product works like it is supposed to. My only complaint is the wire nuts included are one size too small to connect 2 neutral wires with the device. If your home is like mine, line and load wires are both black and installed side by side. A multimeter is recommended.\n41#Almost perfect but with one major flaw!! I love the style of these switches. Love the color changing led hardware. The Cync app isn't that bad. With some additional software updates such as controlling the led color this could have been the perfect switch. The reviews about connectivity issue could because their in home Wi-Fi is not setup properly. But it has one major hardware flaw. The button is hard to press!!! Like how do you mess that up? The most basic functionality. Let me be clear, you will not notice this when installing the switch because you will test it by pressing the center of the button. But if you are trying to walk and press the button sometimes it does not register even though you will hear and feel a 'click'. I called support and found out this is normal. You basically have to press the center, top or bottom of the circle to register the click. Pressing on the left or right side, you will hear and feel it click but nothing will happen. If you want to quickly use the switch as you walk by or have your hands full and try to use the elbow it, you will run into this issue. And I know its a first world problem but it is so frustrating. I ordered 40 more of these switches and was about to change every single switch before I realized this problem. I'm just disappointed as this could have been the perfect product and the price well worth it.\n42#Do not buy this product, over priced, app lacks feature, No Good. Seeking a brand name got me fooled with this product this time. I opted for GE being its trade name but for a price of over $45, this product, as other folks have negatively commented, do not deliver the results. Agreed with other reviewers that the app was corky & worked 1/2 of the time. The app alone lacks so much basic feature such as no scheduling, auto On/Off features. My alternative? the TP-Link by Kasa HS220, hands down the winner & for 1/2 the price. sorry GE not this product\n43#Poor app. I love the switches, it’s hard to wire it in our old home, the app is poor and difficult to program, I had to call tech-support I was on it almost a hour, it’s too bad the switches aren’t easier to program\n44#Great switches. Excellent switches! Easy to install (assuming you don't need to rewire). The app isn't the best but it gets the job done! I haven't had any problems with the app. You don't need it for much other than setting up devices. Check your wiring before you buy. It's your own fault if you bought these and can't use them.\n45#Nothing but trouble- don't count on tech support to help. 1) Connecting the wires was a breeze, but waiting for it to connect to the internet and Alexa devices took multiple attempts to reset the switch 2) Every other month the switch loses connection to the internet (even though the router is 1 room over) 3) Once there was a problem with GE (not even the switches), where smart controls were lost for a day or two because of problems with the GE software (according to technician this was a global problem) 4) 6months after purchasing the switch- it went CRAZY. Even if I switch the switch off, the lights keep flickering. (It's the switch because when I replaced it with an old one, the lights work normally again). 5) I called for tech support (they kept trying to find something else wrong, to put the blame elsewhere- \"can you think of anything else that may have damaged the switch?\" \"is it the lightbulbs?\" \"Are the lightbulbs GE?\"). Then I was told since they couldn't figure it out, they would escalate it. FORGET trying to even figure out if there is a warranty - tech said it could be 30 days or 90days or... Bottom Line: I am absolutely frustrated with this product and their tech support.\n46#Didn’t work. No one including electricians could get it to work, wish I could return it.\n47#Going downhill now that it is Cync. I've updated my review, moving from 2 stars to 1 star, because \"C by GE\" changed to \"Cync\" and since the change my switch became unusable. Before the change, I could use the app to control the switch. I didn't need an account, I didn't need to login, I didn't need to connect with any online services. I could just open the app and turn on/off the light switch. The new Cync app is terrible. You have to create an account with them, you have to enable iCloud, you have enable lots of online services that have nothing to do with turning on and off the light switch on the wall right over there. I even raised this up in the app store and they just shrugged. Yep. No online account? No ability to control the physical device you paid money for. The important part of this change is that it DID work. It's not that this isn't possible. It's just that they took that functionality away with an update to the app.\n48#No traveler. These are advertised as 4 wire and 3 way switches. I had previously purchased the 3 wire and purchased the 4 wire assuming the additional wire would be a traveler. The 4th wire they are counting is the neutral and not a traveler wire. They have a wiring method to make it work as a 3 way but I was looking for a switch that made use of the traveler wires. So I there really isn't any advantage of the getting the 4 wire vs 3 wire.\n49#Great Wireless dimmer. Install it for my walk in closet very nice not to have to use the switch anymore. But wish it could go dimmer more than 5%.",
