Not a lot of adjustability\n1#Light. Son muy útiles ya q no me gusta la luz fuerte me encanta\n2#These are fine. After being professionally installed and checked I find they all make a low buzzing sound. And the dimming isn't as wide of a range as I had hoped, but they work.\n3#Do Not Buy... Product hums and LED Lights filcker. This is a terrible product. The dimmer itself makes an audible humming noise when power is on, and the lights flicker and any power level. The adjustment wheel does nothing. I tried all six dimmers at multiple locations with multiple lights... same two problems. STAY AWAY!!!!\n4#Looks good and modern but some switches come in messed up. Looks good but a lot of switches come in defected out of the Pack ordered a bunch of these about 10 of them and out of the 10 three came messed up which unfortunately there’s no option to send back the three defected ones. These are too pricey to be having defected ones. update not sure if it because I’m using led can lights but now there are starting to flicker i think switches might be going bad because I changed it to spare one that I had left and it stop the lights from flickering\n5#Missing screws . And missing other parts. I dont like that 6 screws are missing and one face plate And when i got the time to finally install the return window had passed..\n6#Looks nice, but way too many failures right away. I bought two 6 packs of these back in November when we were ordering a bunch of stuff for a new custom home build. They sat in the box till this week when we finally started to trim all the electrical out. Out of the 12 we have installed, we already have 3 failures. 1 won’t switch on at all, 2 come on, but the dimmer does nothing. Just full brightness…. 25% failure rate is pretty alarming. At this point I’m assuming all of them will fail within the first year or so. Price was pretty good, but at about $12/switch they aren’t something you want to burn through like candy.\n7#Range of dimming is hard to notice. The range of dimming is too less and you can hardly see the difference when it is set to low intensity. It is cheap but does it solve the dimmer purpose ? No . It was out of return window by the time contractor installed them in my basement . I will not buy it again the same brand .\n8#MUY BUENO. Buena compra\n9#Kitchen lights. Good value.\n10#Easy Install, LED lights are a problem. Easy Install: Insert wire and tighten screw. No wire nuts needed. Dimmer is similar to Leviton Sure Slide but less expensive. Generally dimmer works very well. The problem is LED lights, lights with drivers work better than without, limited dimming range with LED, doesn't dim as much as incandescent bulbs, lower dimming helped by lower wattage LED's.\n11#Noisy: Switches buzz while turned on. I am a builder/remodeler by trade: I work with and install electrical components on a near daily basis. I bought a set of 6 of these as a retrofit for the dimmer switches in my own home. My house is older and has rotary dimmers. Rotary dimmers don’t play well with dimmable LED lights as they will usually make the lights flicker and/or pulse. I wasn’t concerned about using a specific style of switch so I chose these switches due to the per-switch price point only. These switches are stated to be for LED lights so I figured they should be just fine for my need. Upon installing one I discovered that if I dim the lights, even slightly, the switch buzzes. The more I dimmed the light, the louder the buzz got. At their dimmest setting, the buzz could be heard around a corner and 20+ feet from the switches location. I removed that switch and tried another from the box. It did exactly the same thing. I also discovered that it still made the lights flicker while using the dimmer, which is the very reason I am replacing the old switches to begin with. The flicker wasn’t as bad as the old rotary switch, but still very bothersome & annoying none the less. I cannot recommend these switches in any way. I was able to return the switches for full refund.\n12#Interruptores. Se miran bien pero no oscurecen quedan como una luz normal compre un paquete de 6 y al instalarlos el electricista se dio cuenta de que uno no servía salió defectuoso no volvería a comprar.\n13#It's okay. The build quality seems fine. However, the slide is too short and the bulbs don't dim as much. I know my bulbs can dim darker but the throw of the slider is too short and won't go to full dimness. Getting something else. Too late to return because I didn't install these in a timely manner.\n14#Broke after a few days! 2 out of 6 switches broke after a few days. Very poor quality!!!!\n15#Good, but dim rate is small. These work fine, but don't dim dark enough, whereas I know the bulbs can go darker\n16#Does not dim adequately. Installed this dimmer and found it barely dimmed the lights. Installed a different brand of dimmer and lights dimmed as expected. If you only need an off/on switch these would be fine. If you need dimmer these are not for you.\n17#Switch but the highest quality. With the switch at the lowest setting, LED light still stays on at a very low illumination.\n18#Can get really hot. I use this on 2 LED low profile light and i notice metal housing got really hot. Not sure if this is normal or not. The other i use on one LED garage light. That one got even hotter almost couldn’t touch it. I remove both but not sure what it could be good for if i cant even use on a 16W LED light.\n19#Only half worked. 3 worked great and the other 3 turned on but did not dim at all. I couldn't return them as they were already installed in customer's homes by the time I got to a broken one.\n20#Not good. I tried these dimmers in a number of places. They are supposed to work with LED bulbs but everywhere I tried them they caused the lights to flash or just come on full with no dimming. I tried with ordinary bulbs and with LEDs with similar, disappointing results. Do no recommend. A regular old dimmer switch from HD worked right out of the box. Now I have 6 useless dimmers that I can't even give away.\n21#They work. Overall, they work. I just installed 6 of these dimmers in my house. Kind of low build quality but you get what you pay for.. at 8 bucks a peice, hard to complain. Though, I would recommend Leviton.\n22#They don’t work! Don’t waste your money!!!!!! Out of the 6 I bought only one worked!\n23#Works great. I really liked looks and works great!\n24#Failed after about 2 months. I purchased a six pack of these with the intention of installing them all. I only got around to installing one of them and it has failed in less than three months. I am not going to bother installing the others\n25#Junk. Do not dimn. 0)6.. All junk. Missed the return window, so my fault, but these are trash. I've installed hundreds of oitl and switches. These didn't dim at all. To test my theory and complete the project, I installed dimmers from Menard's. Guess what?! They worked as described.... First time. These are junk.\n26#Product did not dim as much as I would have liked. Would have like product to dim more than it did from the low end of the spectrum all the way to the upper end it had a limited dimming capability tried adjusting it with the round dial on the right side with no luck\n27#Cheap. I should have known from the price this was going to be an inferior product. But I decided to take the chance regardless. The dimmer switch barley dims the light there is an additional setting to turn it up or down but all in all on lowest setting the light is still very bright\n28#So much easier to use then many other dimmer styles. Its a totally in your face dimmer. No guessing or programming experience needed to turn it or or dim it. No Bluetooth or multitaps of buttons necessary to go to full brightness. There is a small wheel to set the lowest setting that does not appear to do much, but I put them on LED fixtures and those things have current regulators in them so I cannot fault the dimmer. Most important thing is that it works with no flickering or noise.\n29#Defective Switches and Manufacturer Contact Info Incorrect. Out of the 6 switches I received, only 4 worked. I switch didn't work at all, 1 switch the dimmer did not work. After trying to contact the manufacturer, the support email bounced back and phone number was disconnected. My only option was to uninstall all the switches, and return all 6 for a full refund - which a major delay in completing my light installation.\n30#Better then old one. Plate is little smaller then old one it have to touch up paint\n31#Whiter than our regular flat switches. Works great, excellent value. However these don't match perfectly with our normal white switches. The borders are a brighter white, doesn't match the best.\n32#Flickering. Not sure if it’s the switch or bulbs but 2 of the 3 installed flickers badly. Will try changing bulbs but I suspect it’s the switch since the bulbs didn’t flicker before installing the switch.",
