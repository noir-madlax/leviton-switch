Some did not work or when you barley touched it would go on.\n1#Good quality. Great quality. Would definitely buy again if needed. Fits perfect.\n2#It works, but not the same finish as their other products. They work, but the reason I bought this brand specifically is so that it would match the other switches and outlets I bought. Instead this is glossy white, not matte white like since of their other products\n3#Cheep Chinese crap. Cheep Chinese crap do not buy.\n4#Failed after less than 2 years. Purchased in April 2023. 1 side broke February 2025 leaving the switch in the always-on position. Not sure how long a switch should last, but it feels like it should have been longer than this. Functionally, until it broke it worked well. This was in a bathroom that did not receive frequent usage.\n5#Light switch. Just as described\n6#Good price. Easy to Instal, durable and good price\n7#Arrived defective. After installed it didn't work. Tried to fix it to avoid returning. But still didn't work. For safety, I'm going to home depot.\n8#Buen producto. Buen precio\n9#Couldn't find this anywhere but Amazon. Couldn't find this at any of the local hardware stores. Great Price. Easy to install. Did it myself and saved a ton. Remember to hit the breaker.\n10#Dead on arrival. I installed the switch, restored power, and... nothing. I pulled it back out and tested it with a multimeter. Both switches were completely dead. No matter what I did, or how I pressed or wiggled them, I couldn't close either circuit. I had to make a trip to the home store the next day to replace it with one that actually worked. Pros: - It looked nice. Cons: - Completely broken fresh out of the box.\n11#Switches feel solid. I like the clean white color and the solid feel it had when flipping each switch. If you are looking to replace your old switch, be sure to check the dimensions. This was smaller than my previous but the location of the screws were the same. Overall excellent and seemingly good quality.\n12#Good Quality, Basic Switch. We used this switch to replace a long-standing one in our older home. We considered others, but this one provided the basic function in a durable, aestheticly pleasing switch. Nothing fancy, but it works!\n13#Light switch. Husband installed & it works like a charm.\n14#Feels like it's stuck. Switch feels like its, stuck, hard to switch. Not used to that feeling when using other brands.\n15#DEFECTIVE THROWS BREAKER. Be careful wanted a. Hour messing with this product\n16#Works as intended! Its a simple, modern looking, toggle style, dumb switch. If you want a normal, old-fashion switch that looks modern, this is the way to go. Its great, doesn't connect to the internet, no big-tech companies getting their noses into how many times I turn on my switch and installing was the same as in the past. 5-Stars!\n17#Love it works awesome. Exactly what I needed for my bathroom fan and light combo works awesome\n18#Great quality. Installed new ceiling fan / light in bedroom. Easy to install and great value.\n19#Great switch. Easy to hook up\n20#Nice upgrade for my lighting switch. I had bought one of these years ago for my other bathroom and I absolutely loved it. Well now my other one needed one so I looked and found this one. It was a little different from the one I already did before (been 15 years). I got it hooked up and everything works mostly. You don't have to actually push the switch hard to turn it on or off. In fact the switch doesn't have to move at all, just a slight touch and it turns on and off. Unfortunately I took a couple of months to install it, so I missed the return. I'm sure it's just a bad switch, that does happen from time to time. Overall I really do like it very much though.\n21#Switches on and off randomly. Faulty switch. No way of contacting customer support.\n22#Works as it should. Working as it should.\n23#Great product! It was exactly what I ordered, It works great!\n24#Faulty Switch. Both top and bottom switches only work with sustained pressure. If you turn on the switch, light comes on and immediately turns off. If you push harder the light will come back on but immediately turn off if you let go. Past the return window, make sure to test right away.\n25#Nice Modern Touch. This was a nice little upgrade in my newly remodeled bathroom from the old toggle switch that was installed in the 1980s. Does it’s job and is visually appealing.\n26#All standard. With some products, I'm always afraid they may not fit. This has standard dimensions so it fits perfectly. I'll buy it again. Standard quality too.\n27#Top switch worked bottom one didn't unless you kept pressing on it. Installed it properly but it's a cheap switch. The top switch worked fine, the bottom one only stayed on if I kept putting pressure on it. Lame. Went to HomeDepot and purchased a Leviton double switch and it works great. Missed the return window so in the trash this pos goes. Buyer beware.\n28#Nice switch. Works well. Easy to install.\n29#Dual rocker. Does what it’s supposed to do.\n30#Cost is responsible. I like Amazon always a pleasure\n31#A more modern, upscale look. I changed out my flip switches to these. The wiring was straightforward and as simple as can be. These switches feel more solid when turning off and on and just look so much better. I just wish the covers were screwless. Despite that, they work perfectly.\n32#Works great. Price is better than local big box stores.\n33#Perfect switch for separating bathroom light and fan, so you can turn on independently. This switch was a lower cost than local hardware stores, and seems to work well. My condo had just a single switch that turned on both the bathroom lights and fan together. I don't always want the fan on, so this switch made it easy to separate without having to change the wall box.\n34#The location of the grounding part appears to be incorrect. I don't know if the manual is wrong or the design is wrong, but the ground is located under the hot wire, so there is a risk of short circuit if done incorrectly. Rather, I think it would be safer to place the hot wire on the opposite copper nut and use the black nut as a running light wire. Of course, if the two separate wires are from different single phases, you have to do it the same way as before, but the green ground wire is too close to the hot wire, so construction will be done on the shorted line, but it is likely to be too close during construction or when a short circuit such as heat generation occurs. The risk exists.\n35#Just ok. Some worked and done didn’t, I would recommend you buy at one of the home improvement retail stores\n36#Good! Easy to install\n37#Didn't work. My son installed this new switch, but it didn't work. Unfortunately, he threw out the box it came in so I couldn't return.\n38#Junk. Had for one year a d it fell apart. My fan and light was stuck on for 2 days until I could replace it.\n39#Nice switch. Double switch was what I needed. This one has a nice actuation feel.\n40#Work very well. Thanks. I replaced for the bathroom double switch\n41#Switch for bathroom fan and light. Installed this for the bathroom exhaust fan and light. Works as expected. Seems well constructed and was easy enough to install. 6 months of use with no problems\n42#Great for price. Really like the color. Easy installation. Just head up read the directions. For two way light/fan, you must take out the middle piece between the screws.\n43#Rockers. After installed, one switch going to a bank of colored lights then other to a naked bulb, discovered rocking switches quickly both simulates strobe lights and is annoying. Switch(s) held up to the abuse.\n44#Great Product, it works. It was exactly what I needed; it work great\n45#Worked perfectly and easy to install. I used this switch to separate a fan and light in a powder room. Easy to install, fit the existing switch space effectively, and directions were very good. Very pleased with the purchase.\n46#Great cheap replacement. worked perfectly and comes with the cover plate to boot!\n47#Defective. We had an electrician install a bathroom exhaust fan/light and this wall switch. Only one function would work using this switch. It's past the return window so that's not an option. I do not recommend this product.",
