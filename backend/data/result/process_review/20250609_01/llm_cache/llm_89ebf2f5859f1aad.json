I installed three of these switches two months ago. Last week, one stopped responding to the switch. It could still be controlled by the app, but the physical switch did nothing. Last night, the other two wouldn't work when I tried to turn them on. Again, the app works but the switch itself is useless. Now I get to remove and replace them with something else. They are out of the 30 day return window, and the support number goes directly to voicemail. I emailed them, hopefully I get an answer back UPDATE: I received this response from the company- Hi, Thank you for your email. We apologize for the inconvenience. Don't worry, we are here to help you. Could you please try these steps? 1. Please kindly turn off the breaker and turn it back on. This usually fixes this type of issue. 2. If not working, please try to knock the switch 5-6 times continuously using your knuckle. After knocking, turn the switch on/off to see if it works. If you don't knock the switch again, please repeat this 4 times. 3. Then, press it to turn on and off to check if it is working this time. Please let us know whether this helps. Thank you! I turned the breaker off and on , they did start working. I've never had to do this with any other switch, so that doesn't bode well for their quality. I'm not sure how I feel about their go-to for fixing electronics being basically \"Punch the switch repeatedly until it works\". That doesn't give me that warm fuzzy feeling either.\n2#Junk. Junk i didn't even have the switch for a week and one went bad i went to contact the company and they want me to go through all of these test before they send a new one no not recommend\n3#Great idea. These work as described. Light up , but aren't so bright that they blind you. good guidance at night for navigating the house. Fair price if you shop around Amazon.\n4#All failed within a month. Have have over 20 of the old style with the pigtails. I installed 3 of the 4 switches in a room about a month ago and now none of them work. There is a 4th dimmer switch that uses the same ground and neutral and it works fine. I have done residential electrical for over 30 years, checked power, ground and neutral, all good. They will not even work manually.\n5#Do not buy these. I bought bunch of these and installed them they stopped working can’t turn any lights on They are all garbage\n6#Garbage. These are garbage! Stopped working after 2 months. Wish I could leave no stars\n7#Great product. Easy install and set up.\n8#esta muy bueno. facil de usar\n9#Must have. This product is amazing, no complaints\n10#Lasted a month. Used for one month and 2 of 4 stopped working, extremely disappointed. When it worked was great but at least they were easy to install.\n11#Smart switch. Easy to install and work awesome\n12#terrible quality. This product was poor quality under the name Gosund, I believe the company changed the name to start over. But its the same product. These switches stop working after a short period of time. They will either fail manual operation, or all together. I currently have 10 of these switches in my home and only 5 are working properly. I tried following all of the support steps and none have helped. Buying this product is a gamble.\n13#Easy to install and use. Easy to install. Needed to add an extra wire on some old switches as there way no neutral to the old switches. The app is easy to use and setting up timers is really easy. Also, was able to connect them to Google home.\n14#Very poor quality. Do not buy this junk. I bought a set of these about 2 months ago and two of them are not working anymore. I bought another set about 3 years ago and they all stopped working, but the brand was different; however when I got the recent ones they were also from the same App and the brand is the same Gosund. So Gosung and GHome is the same crappy brand. I was expecting these switches to last me at least 10 years or more, why not? Absolute garbage\n15#Don’t work or don’t last. I got a 3-pack. Only needed one at first and it worked great. Installed 2 more and neither one worked. The original 1 stopped working a year later. Will try a different brand.\n16#Great value and works great. We’ve been transitioning away from Insteon and decided to give the GHome Smart Switches a try—and I’m so glad we did! These switches are fantastic and a fraction of the cost of some other brands. The installation was quick and straightforward, and they connected to the app immediately without any hassle. The integration with Alexa and Google Home works seamlessly, and it’s been so convenient to control the lights with voice commands or through the app. The switches are UL certified, which adds peace of mind, and the 4-pack is a great value for the price. If you’re looking to make the switch from other expensive brands, these are highly recommended for their reliability, ease of use, and affordability!\n17#No wire come with it. Imagine my surprise when i open the box to install these switches and see no wires to attach the switch to the power supply. I have bought several of these and all of them came with wires to attach to the power supply. So now i have to find some wires or go buy wire to attach these switches. Not cool if i would have known would looked else where for a complete kit.\n18#Frustrating Setup and Unreliable Performance ⭐. The GHome Smart Switch was a huge disappointment. Despite being UL certified and supposedly compatible with Alexa and Google Home, the setup process was a nightmare. The app kept disconnecting, and it took multiple attempts to get the switches to pair with my Wi-Fi. Even after setup, the switches were inconsistent—sometimes they responded to voice commands, and other times they didn’t. The requirement for a neutral wire was also a hassle, making installation more complicated than expected. For a 4-pack, I had hoped for a reliable product, but these switches fell far short. Save yourself the frustration and look for a better option.\n19#GHome Lightswitch. These smart switches work so well that I have ordered more.\n20#Don't last long. These worked fine for a few months. Now constantly disconnect and dont respond for hours. Also I have them setup to turn off after 1 hour and they turn off between 2 minutes and never. Not a great value in my opinion and seem to be more trouble then they are worth.\n21#Great switches. These switches can be used as three ways or single switches and they work great with my Alexa\n22#Does the job. I have several smart life products and this one was very easy to add to the app. I like the ability to control the on time and the ability to make a schedule\n23#One died after 3 months. This is my second set of these switches. In my first set, one of the switches died after about a year. In this most recent set, one died after 3 months. There's no way to reset them once they've stopped working. In the photos, the one on the left is working, the one on the right has failed. The green light is constantly on faintly, but it no longer works the device and is disconnected from wifi. No way to reconnect.\n24#Works with KASA / TUYA app then with Alexa or HomeAssistant. These are relatively deep switches so they can be a bit tricky to install if your wall box is already full of extra wire. However, they work great and once you've set them up in the app, they can be easily controlled via Alexa, Google, or HomeAssistant.\n25#Home smart switch. Very easy time install.\n26#Si. It's good price and work !!\n27#One didn't work. But they were replaced.\n28#3 of the 4 switches work fine. Three of the four switches work fine. One of them does not seem to work with Alexa integrations. It doesn't matter how many times and I delete the device and read it, it stops working with Alexa. Come to find out, it appears like Gosund is merging with a company called Tuya. Gosund support it's almost non-existent so basically I'm stuck with a broken switch. The three others work fine for now and I've never had an issue with any of the smart plugs I've used in the past from Gosund.\n29#Keeps disconnecting from the internet. It keeps disconnecting from the internet. Mostly from google. You have to restart and add it again, its very annoying. I bought the four pack, just a waste.\n30#Rock Solid. Lot of people hate on WiFi home automation gear. Truth is that it is considerably faster than Zigbee/Zwave/Thread will ever be. Reliable too...the fact that I can see and diagnose the devices in my DHCP lease table if necessary is great. I do have a great WiFi network but even so I have less than 70 WiFi devices for home automation. Anyway, these have worked flawlessly in Home Assistant in combination with the Tuya Developer Account and Smart Life app. There is literally no delay (NONE) between the time I press a button in HA and when the switch turns on/off. Haven't had to reset them either for any reason. No complaints whatsoever.\n31#Do not hold up over time. We purchased 4 of these 2 years ago. Two of them have already failed. Considering they were not in high traffic areas and there are no children living here, it's fair to say they have failed the durability test.\n32#Would give it zero if I could. Worst smart switch I have ever owned. The app is nothing but ads for more products and setup was way more confusing than it should have been.\n33#Works Great. Great addition to our Smart Home. Just be sure you have a \"Live\" wire at each switch location. Took a little bit of playing within the Tumu APP and the Alexa APP to rename the switches. (I installed 12 single pole and 1 double pole (sold separatly) All work great. Very easy pairing to WiFi.\n34#It works. Devices work as intended. However, setup was a little challenging even thought the instructions make it look as easy as 1,2,3 and it wasn't. The great part is that customer service is very helpful and everything in the end was great. I'm happy to have purchased these devices. Notes: 1. Make sure when connecting these devices thru your smart phone, that your smart phone is connected to the same WIFI you want to connect the light switches to. I have multiple WIFI's and that was a time consuming issue to figure out. 2. When using the Gosund app to connect your switches, every time i tried to connect, the app said it wasn't successful and it times out. This is is not true, even though the app times out, I learned that the switches were connected regardless of this error. This wasted a lot of my time of trying to reconnect my switches when they were already connected. 3. When connecting these switches to Google Home, make sure you label the switches correctly, and I found that connecting one switch at a time works best instead of waiting for all of the switch to be active online at one time.\n35#Awfully hard to set-up. Awfully hard to set-up\n36#They work well. My experience with these items has been good. They work well.\n37#Used to be a good product. These switches are unreliable and Gosund's customer service is rubbish. I purchased my first Gosund smart switches in 2021. I had them installed by an electrician and they worked great. In the process of having some work done in my house, one went bad. In June 2023, I bought four more and had them professionally installed in July of 2023, replacing the bad one. I also had a dimmable one installed. A few months later, the dimmable one wouldn't reconnect to Alexa, and now one of the others is completely dead. In November of 2023, I wrote to Gosund explaining that my brand new switch was dead. They asked for receipts and other documentation which I sent. I heard nothing back. I just wrote to them again asking if there was any resolution. They sent an email with additional instructions, falsely claiming they had already sent it once. Now I'm supposed to make a video, upload it, and send the link. I've already spent too much time on this. I'll just buy another brand.\n38#Used in Google Home and the look nice and function well! In an older home it may be difficult to cram one or 2 of these into an old metal electrical box...you may need to upgrade to a deeper box. Remember you need a white ground wire in the box. I used Smart Home for my App.\n39#I bought a four pack wi fi light switches and one does not work. I have many products from this company but after installing three of them and the fourth has an electrical issue. I clearly did not want to uninstall after three were working. Now being a Chinese company its impossible to get customer service to resolve.\n40#It broke after 1 year. Yes, it was easy to install, it worked fine with Google. I haven't tried it with Alexa. Once the year passed, one switch lost connectivity and I wasn't able to reset it. It works manually, but so a regular switch will...\n41#We dont live in a simulation, but my home is becoming a tech playground! Tony Stark…naww, Bruce Wayne.. whos that?! I am the tech genius billionaire now!.. well at least that’s how I feel with these smart switches. I can turn my lights on and off with the power of my mind..which controls the switches by sending electric impulses from my brain to my mouth in the form of words (jealous much..i know you are!) And the best part? I didn't even need to hire a fancy electrician to install it. The whole thing took about 15 minutes, including removing the old switch, installing and pairing it on my phone. \"Hey Google, turn on the family room lights,\" a wave of odd awesomeness (AUsomeness), came over me and the lights turned on and I couldn’t help but smirk like a 5 year old kid. Setting up timers, and schedules makes things easy. And lets be real, when its 1230am and im about to lose myself in a simpsons mini marathon, me setting Its not actually being lazy, I didn’t get the switches because im too lazy to turn off the lights, I got the switches for energy management, as well as better living through technology, as you can see from my other reviews, im a bit of a tech junky/nerd. These switches will hopefully allow me to reallocate my resources to focus on other pressing matters…like global domination from my amazon reviews. Someone sponsor me already, caaaamaaaan!! 180k annually (to start) along with other perks is all I ask for. Looking forward to getting messages on how I can be a professionally reviewer.\n42#Great so far! I have installed these before and was replacing one that broke from a different brand. Super easy to install and very easy to connect to the app and smart life app. I will buy more if needed. Great thing is when it is off there is no light.\n43#Not reliable…. Bought many for our home. Have had 4 now malfunction, 3 after 2 years & now one of the replacements after being in use for about 4 months. All same issue, they lose ability to connect to the network. At this price I would expect more reliability. We are going to have to shop for another brand, these are too pricey to have to keep replacing.\n44#Too big to fit most 2x4 boxes. I could not get these to fit into my metal single gang light switch boxes.\n45#Stopped working after flipping breaker. Of the 4-pack I purchased, 2 were installed a year ago. Yesterday I replaced one of those two and installed another, and my other switch from a year ago also failed during that maintenance. In both cases, they stopped working even as a dumb switch after the breaker had been flipped. One was in the kitchen, and the breaker flipped because the microwave and another appliance were on at the same time (neither of them pulling current across the switch--just the same circuit). Once the breaker came back on, the green LED at the bottom lights up, but pressing the switch doesn't have any effect, and they also show offline. Yesterday, I replaced the failed switch, and installed another since I had my tools out. I turned the breaker to a different room off and on a few times (off to verify circuit and change switch, on to test installation before buttoning up, off to button up, on to use) to install it. And that caused another Gosund switch on the same circuit to fail in the same way. The green LED at the bottom lights up, but the switch won't power the lights and it shows as offline. Holding the switch down for 5, 10, 30 seconds has no effect. Both switch installs were less than a year old, and were properly grounded. Gosund has offered to send me (but I haven't yet received) replacement switches. But, I don't have any reason to expect the two new ones to behave differently. It's not horrible replacing switches, but neither is it something I care to do over and over just to keep my lights working.\n46#Super easy to install. The switch is very easy to install. Set up on smart devices is just as easy. I have updated most of my switches that’s to these!\n47#Easy installation and control. They are very easy to install. I'm an electrical novice and found them to have very simple installation. I can easily control them through Alexa when at home or my cell phone when away. Great investment and compliments our security cameras. I can fool intruders when I'm away.",
