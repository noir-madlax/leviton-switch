After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Smart Wi-Fi Enabled Dimmer Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a.

Be aware that Kasa does not stand behind the quality of thier products. Purchased a switch which ended up being a manufacturing defect and Kasa would not replace it. Not a good way to keep customers. I'll be purchasing Leviton instead.\n1#For lazy people like me. Just bought one and now we want one for every room. It looks great up against our white walls with black doors. Not too big. I can even tell Alexa to dim it to a specific percentage. Not bad for the price either. Make sure you buy dimmable light bulbs or you could start a fire. They dim well. You can turn off either by the button or the smart home.\n2#Sleek Looking. Easy to install. Instructions were good for someone with basic electrical background. Nice to have control via the app. Sleek looking. Got duh black color. Go Bears. Superbowl Super Bears.\n3#Medium level install skills. Looks/works great. It’s not necessarily an easy install, but it’s also not frustrating-level of install. Probably not good for older homes (pre 2000) as you need a deeper box. You can use a standard “deco” wall plate. I have two, together in a single box, with a double deco plate. Looks sleek.\n4#Easy to install and set up. I prefer these toggle button kasa switches over other smart switches and it took less than a minute to set up in the kasa app and works perfectly with Google.\n5#Nice. Very nice and easy to configure\n6#Works great. I've been using these for years with home assistant. These are my go to when I decide I need one in another room. I'm glad they offer them in black now.\n7#Great quality east\\\\y to install operate near identical to Amazon switches. Vert satisfied\n8#Easy to install. Work like a charm\n9#Have installed a dozen of these - love them. Best interface I’ve seen from any DIY smart switch. Grouping ability is too notch, and Alexa integration is bulletproof. I love being able to control other switches remotely from one switch…really helpful when I don’t want to rewire and I need to add more lights. Good quality switch mechanics, but the non-toggle takes a little getting used to.\n10#They simply work as expected! Simple install and work perfectly with my LED transformers to dim undercounter lights. Really pleased with the simple integration with Alexa.\n11#Missing “Fade Rate” on schedule. This black version of HS-220 is missing the fade rate on the schedule feature in the app. So if you are building a sunrise simulator like me you are out of luck. Oddly enough, the white version of HS-220 that I bought earlier does have the fade rate feature.\n12#So far so good. Works great.\n13#Finally in black! Kasa is a great ecosystem. We have switches, plugs, and outlets. All great. Only drawback was they only came in white. Now you have black as well for where you need it. Easily linked to and works well with Alexa.\n14#Does not work. Connected all wires following the instructions, light dimmed but tried to setup with Kasa App (kind of tricky) and Alexa and did not responded nor turned on. Had to return it. Although looks modern and sleek, value for money but uneasy installation.\n15#Beautiful. Beautiful dimmers that work with alexa make sure that you have a neutral wire in the switch box\n16#And then I bought more! This switch is very easy to set up using the Bluetooth option - game changer! And as I was completing the set-up, Alexa notified me that I had a new device connected, as well. I’ve tried products from other manufacturers and returned them. I only use light almond and black switches and outlets in my home, so I’m happy that this dimmer is finally available in black. Now I just need Kasa to make their 3-way smart switches in light almond and black, too.\n17#Not a bad switch. Works with the kasa app, google home and alexa. had to integrate it with home assistant to get it to work with homekit. I'm not sure why the white version gets the homekit option built in, but the black one doesn't but oh well.",
