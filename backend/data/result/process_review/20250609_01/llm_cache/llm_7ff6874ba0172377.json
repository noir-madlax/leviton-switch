This dimmer switch is a top-notch solution for controlling ELV lighting systems. Its compatibility with various lighting types, including dimmable LEDs and halogen bulbs, makes it versatile for different setups. The installation process is straightforward, and the device integrates seamlessly with the Lutron Smart Hub, allowing for convenient control via smartphone or voice commands. The soft-glow light bar is a nice touch, providing visibility in low-light conditions. Overall, it's a reliable and user-friendly dimmer switch that enhances the functionality of smart lighting systems.\n1#Incompatible with some ELV lights. I've tried to install this switch three times for my ELV light fixture, which is a total of 150 amps, well within the specs. Each time it works for 1 minute, flickers, and breaks. I've installed twenty other smart switches without incident, so I doubt I'm installing it wrong, and this fixture workers fine with a conventional ELV dimmer. I'm sure the switch works correctly with the proper lights, but somehow it's not compatible with all ELV fixtures (mine) despite the stated specs.\n2#Excellent. Worked perfectly with a twelve volt electronic transformer controlling LED strip lights.\n3#Worked to control light fixture when other Lutron smart switches didn't. This worked to control a ceiling mounted LED fixture that wouldn't work with other Lutron smart switches. I exhausted all other wiring options with their tech support (who are great by the way and seem to be available 24/7). As a last ditch option the tech suggested buying this switch and it worked like a charm.\n4#Needs a hub. Be aware that you still need a hub to get any smart functionality out of the switch. At this price I would've hoped it had built in Wi-Fi. It does work very well though. I can dim my led wafer recessed lighting very low with no flicker\n5#Perfect for strip lighting. When I switched my under cabinet lighting from halogen puck to strip leds, standard Lutron switch no longer worked. This Lutron switch works with the low voltage led strip lighting and still dims.\n6#Pricey, but a solid solution for retrofit of existing low voltage lighting. In the past 6 weeks I've purchased more the $2k in Caseta switches etc as I work to replace an aging home automation system. The Caseta ELV+ have worked well to manage an array of low voltage transformer controls, new and old. The documentation in the box is very basic and does not address many of the features this switch offers, and for some reason Lutron does a good job hiding the complete documentation deep in their website and embedded in a document that attempts to cover all of the other switch products at the same time. A simple QR code that goes directly to this products manual would go a long way toward my initial experience. That said they do work well, even with low voltage halogen bulbs, just be sure and add up your bulb wattage and don't exceed 250W. Set up is simple (with proper manuals) and the switches and covers have a quality look and feel. The ELV+ are a great solution for LV transformer control, but they are pricey!!.\n7#A lifesaver! I was using electronic transformer on my undercabinet lights and the regular dimmer switch didn’t work thank goodness they made a low-voltage option. It solved my flickering lights problem.\n8#Really expensive but does the job for newer LED undercabinet lighting. I just hate that I have to spend $130 to make undercabinet/toekick lighting work with Home Assistant but these ELV+ dimmers work flawlessly with the Caseta systm and HA integration.\n9#A Great Addition to the Best-In-Class Caseta Line. I have lots of home automation stuff including three or four brands of switches that I've tried over the years - these are all being slowly replaced with Caseta since it's so reliable. I put this particular switch to replace an older model PD-10NXD. It's connected to a fairly new LED fixture which was flickering almost constantly with the old switch. With this new ELV+ Diva switch, it now seems to be working flawlessly. I also much prefer this style of Paddle Switch to the older Caseta units which have buttons. Highly recommend this switch if you have some newer, difficult to dim LED fixtures/bulbs. For more standard lights, the standard (non-ELV+ Diva) switches are working great for me and are roughly half the price of this one.\n10#Wow…. Easy install. Very stable. Great integration with Apple HomeKit",
