Works great, everything as described. Have had it for a month now and has held up no issues. Color is exactly as in pictures. Standard size. Will purchase again if need dimmer that doesn’t require a neutral wire. Great value for money.\n1#Works real nice and easy to install. Works great every time\n2#Awesome Switch. This dimmer switch is great. Easy to install and it now operates my new recessed LED lights.\n3#Best traditional non smart dimmer. I enjoy every aspect about this switch. As an electrician, this device provides a \"wow\" moment to my customers. Avoid the other \"elegrp\" knock off it's not the same quality\n4#Dimmer. Easy to install and works well.\n5#4-way LED dimmer works great. If you have 4 light switches that controls a set of lights, then this is what you want. Instructions were absolutely simple to follow, the videos they provide online were very helpful. I am NOT an electrician, and i was able to install these 4 LED dimmer switches without any problem at all. I highly recommend Lutron, mostly for the instructional videos! Those made this as simple as frying a hamburger.\n6#Nice surprise for bathroom. My husband purchased this light switch, to my surprise this more than functional. I was surprised he could program a one touch for the morning. The light will turn a low light. And with another tap of the switch the light will go to full light. This is a great purchase. Definitely would purchase for another room in the house.\n7#Aesthetically perfect. Bought them for kitchen and living room. Live them\n8#Used item. One of the switch boxes was failing apart, the switch appeared to have been previously used/installed and then uninstalled. Connection parts, wire nuts loose inside box, installation instructions were missing. Switch does work but makes one wonder.\n9#Works as intended. Works as intended, the LED light bar is what I like most. LED illuminates for easy to find switch in darkness. Also allows you to see the level of dimness you have set to. Great feature.\n10#Use the QR Code for Perfect Step-by-Step Installation. Absolutely the perfect product and (online-only) installation instructions. The touch-slide dimmer control is cool and how it handles the other switch (non-dimmer switch two-way switch) is good. Non-flicker silent dimming of LEDs is as promised. A tiny improvement would be if it came with one of the wire nuts being a little larger for a 3-wire connection at the other switch.\n11#Confusing Add. The add showed a on/off switch with the option for a dimmer as a 3 way control. I ordered two but when the item was received, it only had two remote dimmers with no on/off switch. I returned the items.\n12#Love it. Love the moderness to it and super easy to use\n13#Works perfectly. Bought and installed 20. Excellent. Slide finger up/down vertical LED bank on dimmer and dimmer setting follows (no plastic track partts to wear / break). Works perfectly as Single Pole / Single Toggle or with Sunnata Accessory switch as part of a 3-way or 4-way. Programmable features (such as variable intensity Switch night / locator light). Really like the touch/hold 2 seconds option that dims lights to off 30 seconds later. Totally stable with ceiling surface and recessed-can replacement LEDs. Some intermittent flickering (1 or 2 times a week at startup) with 100 W equivalent LED bulbs (bulb or fixture???). Almost no intermittent flicker with 60W equivalent bulbs. Works extremely well with incandescent bulbs.\n14#These are great, but is anyone else finding they turn on randomly? I have several of these in my house, and I really like them. They’re clean and elegant and look very high-end. But. I have persistent issues with them turning themselves on at full or partial brightness, when no-one has been anywhere near the switch. An example - I have a seldom-used guest bedroom, and I’ve had to start routinely checking it each day because I’ll find that the dimmer switch is inexplicably set to ~10% brightness (bulbs not even visibly on, but the switch’s light-bar is 10% illuminated) or even fully-on. Either a) I have ghosts/unauthorized guests, or b) there is something weird in my house wiring (other switches all seem to work fine), or c) there’s a glitch in the Lutron switch units I have. I’d still recommend them, but it’s a puzzler.\n15#Glitchy, delayed. Unfortunately, I am outside of the return window and the switch seems quite delayed when I turned my light on.\n16#Excelente. Recomendado\n17#Great dimming switch - touch operated without bulky side bar. Great with, easy to use and because it is touch sensitive clean and modern looking. Additionally when off switch has a lighted portion that makes it easy to find in the dark\n18#Easy to install touch dimmer. Let's be clear - I dont mess with electricity ever! In fact, this was my first install of anything beyond a smoke alarm which didn't need electricity anyhow! This was an easy install... 15 minutes tops and that was mostly to double check everything I was doing 10 times over. I like how you just slide your finger up and down and dont need to actually press anything to adjust. It's pretty slick. And it has a soft glowing bar that lets you know if the lights are 1/3rd dimmed or 3/4 or wherever you stop your finger. It's modern and is very seamless and unobtrusive on a wall. The trickiest thing was the wall plate and separating it so I could screw the base plate in and then reattach the wall plate to the base. They come connected and separating them makes it feel like you will break it. Use an old credit card to slip between them and they pop apart. We looked that up online. Otherwise, easy install like I said. They could just use that pro-tip in their directions!\n19#Best LED Dimmer - No Flicker! Associated Remote Switch does not work. Love this 3-way dimmer switch, it's control over my 3 LED dimmable bulb chandelier is spectacular! But . . . The associated remote 3-way dimmer switch (I ordered two and neither are remote controls, they are simply 3-way switches, over $25 each.) does not control the original base unit. I am sorely disappointed.\n20#Top notch. I don’t normally write reviews but this dimmer is actually sick. Super easy to install (watch the video) and looks great. My super picky wife (project manager and interior designer) even liked it.\n21#Natural light is brght needed dimmer. Easy to install, followed directions. Fit into 3 gang spot. Dims new kitchen ceiling can lights. Turned off electricity before installing.\n22#Great look, great dimmer. I wasn’t sure that these would work with our new LED lights, but they work great. I love the smooth LED light strip on the switch.\n23#Better than the big box options. Less than the big box options, installed no problem and is very modern/unique looking.\n24#Works as Described. Bought for a 3 way pole install for an existing switch, followed the diagram on instructions. Easy install.\n25#Awesome light switch. These switches might be expensive but they are by far the best ones I've ever used. It will dim my LED lights work no flickering and some of the nicest and smoothest dimming transitions I've seen and very responsive to your touch, can be turned on by simply touching the switch and sliding your finger up and down for desired brightness and the lighted strip on the side makes it easy to find in the dark. Even my electrician was impressed and took the info so he can install these in his home highly recommend if you need a dimmer switch, especially for LED light fixtures\n26#Rocker Design is Wretched. I installed this rocker switch in my bedroom, then couldn’t get it out fast enough. You wouldn’t think it is a big deal, but conventional switches, you don’t really have to think “on flip up”, you just flip it. All my other smart switches are 1 touch switches, not sure why those are so hard to find now.\n27#Great dimmer. Quality dimmer. easy to install and very smooth and precise dimming\n28#Pro. Much easier purchasing online. As an electrical contractor, time means money if I forget something at the store an I know I have to come back to customers house the next day REGARDLESS if I go to parts store or not (knock on wood) never had issues with products\n29#Great Dim Switch. This switch was super easy to install and came with pretty much everything you need, minus wire strippers. It dims smoothly by either sliding your finger down the bar or tap on the line wear you want it to dim to(ex touching in the middle for 50%). I haven’t had any complications in the past couple months, and I love the sleek appearance. Definitely recommended for a dimmable LED light.\n30#Love it! This switch will only dim LED bulbs that are dimmable, so make sure you know what you have before installing. Using it on a non-dimmable bulb will do nothing except on & off. I really needed a switch like this because of the 3-way function. It allows me to keep on of the switches \"normal\" and use this switch (either physically ) or using the Lutron app. I also have a Lutron Caseta Smart Hub, so I also get the ability to use this with my Amazon Alexa. It wasn't too difficult to install and the instructions are pretty straight-forward even with limited electrical experience. It's really nice to be able to control my overhead lighting with this switch remotely.\n31#Great one touch dimmer. I love everything about this light switch. It has soft and one touch options that feel great to use. You can slide your finger up or down to control how much light. There is also zero switch noise when pressing up or down. The fact that this model came with a wall plate included made it a great all in one price. I highly recommend this.\n32#Great Light Switch. Thank you so much\n33#Easy to install. I’ve now purchased both the single dimmer and the three-way dimmer with the accessory switch and both were quick and easy to install. I like how the switch slowly turns down and then off the light fixture and can be programmed to whatever light level you choose. Outstanding product. Would highly recommend\n34#Good for some. Great looking switch but does not dim LED “panel” fixtures. As a typical switch this is a really slick looking fixture. Also feels like quality unfortunately this switch was not the right one for my application of LED panel lights.\n35#Works great. I have Lutron throughout the house. This dimmer was easy to install and looks and works great.\n36#Great switches for a staircase/hallway landing light. I replaced the light above the stairs to our second floor (which also functions as the hallway light upstairs) with dimmable LEDs and wanted to capitalize on that feature. These switches were exactly what we needed, installed easily, and have a nice, clean look when in-place. The touch dimmer works quite well and the light on the switch for ease-of-locating is a nice touch.\n37#Trusted Brand. Overall I’m satisfied with this switch. It’s not perfect but still high quality. What I Like 👍 + came with a seamless switch plate. + Easy to install and the wires were labeled (which is honestly quite rare) + touch sensor to adjust the light. + worked on the first try. What I dislike 👎 - touch sensor. This is a personal preference but I prefer the physical slider model over this touch sensor. My worry is “what if…” it fails or doesn’t respond to my inputs? - Not really a switch. Both ends of the paddle switch are just little clicking buttons. So there is really no switching going on just clicking of the two buttons (on and off). Again a personal preference, but I prefer physical switches over fully digital. Overall this is a great product. If you like something with a more modern look and functionality then this is a great option. If you’re more like me and prefer physical touch, then check out one of their other models that offer the same functionality.\n38#Used. Mine came obviously used as it had a burn mark on the side, had wire nut marks on the wire, and didn't work.\n39#Touch dimmer and soft touch on and off, no hard click. This is the first switch that we have installed that has a silent rocker switch. Nice subtle glow when all the lights are off. Easy to adjust dimmer. This was installed to control led can lights. Switch also comes with a Lutron white cover. Lutron has a video on YouTube that you can watch if you need assistance with the install.\n40#Easy install. I like easy of installation, and attachment to my existing house wiring, instructions were straight forward and product material of plastics and metal is very good. The color is a good match for other wall switches. The control my from smart apps and home Smart Control works well, and integrates with Alexa skill without any issues.\n41#Novel light bar for dimmer level, easy to install. I have tried multiple dimmer types over the last few years, and I think this one has the best implemented dimmer features. The touch bar to slide and set the dimmer is pretty awesome. The light bar is bright when using the dimmer, but subdued when the switch is off. As mentioned in the product features, the soft glow at night helps spot the switch in the dark. Although this dimmer supports LED bulbs, I use it with fixtures which still have incandescent bulbs. Why? Because it's a room that we rarely have the lights on in, and the soft on and soft off feature also helps significantly extend the life of the bulbs. That is one feature that I think is absolutely essential for dimmers: A soft ramp to on, and a soft ramp to off. With incandescent bulbs, it gently heats the filament and reduces the thermal shock to it. This significantly extends the life of incandescent bulbs. In fact, I have had the same incandescent bulbs in one fixture for over nine years now. I highly recommend this dimmer for someone looking for something that is still easy to use, and offers some of the best dimmer features.\n42#Lutron LED with a fancy control. Lutron generally makes a good dimmer,especially if you're using a tested light per Lutron's listing (check the website for compatibility). This one is no exception, since it's their LED hybrid dimmer behind a fancy cover plate. I'd admit to preferring the Maestro control or Skylark slider, but this one looks cool and feels cool to use. Would definitely fit into a more modern setting. Install is pretty similar to every other dimming switch. All of the required wire nuts and cover plate are included. Just bring your screwdriver.\n43#Works well - trusted brand. I trust the Lutron brand. I've used it for other projects involving specialty LED light fixtures. This light switch works for regular LED light fixtures. It works well and the quality is much better than the generic switches that I have in other areas of my house. I like that it's easy to use the dimmer and I feel confident that it will last a long time.\n44#Finally an LED dimmer that doesn't Flicker! Finally a dimmer for LED lights that doesn't cause them to flicker. Love this dimmer! Easy to install easy to use, and gives off a nice very soft white night light making it easy to locate the switch in the dark. I also love the way the light trails your finger when adjusting the brightness. I've tried multiple dimmer switches, but this one is by far the best one yet! Lutron is a well known brand and doesn't disappoint. I Highly Recommend this dimmer.\n45#Love Lutron. Lutron is the only brand that I typically buy because their products have always worked well and have been good quality. This dimmer switch is no different. I put this in my bathroom and it works as it should. Great product. I would recommend this if you are looking for a dimmer switch. I also like the fact that it comes with a wall plate.\n46#Luton on the Top as Always. The kit contains a dimmer switch and a wall plate, both of which are included in one package. The wall plate is designed in a screwless manner, providing a modern and sleek appearance. Although the item comes with a relatively higher price tag, it is a dependable switch that has been utilized in a recent renovation project without any reported issues. Installing the dimmer switch is a breeze, and the switch's back's size is small enough to fit into a standard single-gang box. The kit comes complete with a backing plate and a screwless cover that can be effortlessly mounted over the switch, giving a tidy and modern appearance. The switch is fashioned with a touch panel that enables the user to choose the desired light level. The light on the touch panel signifies the level of brightness selected. The switch can be turned on and off by tapping the top or bottom. When the lights are turned off, the touch dimmer emits a faint glow, making it effortless to locate the switch in the darkness without being distracting. This dimmer switch has undergone rigorous testing and is proven to be a reliable addition to your home. ✅I hope you’ve found the information and my review helpful.✅\n47#Nicer than the older slider style. These dimmers are a really nice improvement to the standard slide dimers I’m used to. It looks cleaner and the capacitive touch slider makes for a nicer experience. Something to note is that these aren’t rocker switches as much as they are momentary rockers. What I mean by that is the switch doesn’t lock into the up or down position, but rather it clicks when you press up or down and returns to the same resting position in the center. It was a little weird at first, but I got used to it. It is nice if it’s wired as a 3-way switch since you don’t have the up or down position being seen as on or off. I like that it’s UL listed. It’s well made and comes with everything you need right out of the box. The screwless wall plate adds to the clean look, although I don’t know why Lutron uses a visible 2-piece design. It’s one of the only things that I’m not a fan of on this combo kit. Overall, it’s an easy upgrade to update the look and feel of your dimmer switches if you care to do so.\n48#Easy installation, takes some practice to use it. This switch installs like any other dimmer. It does NOT require a neutral, which surprised me. It will also work in a three-way setup, which also surprised me. Operation of the dimmer is by touch, so it can be a little tricky to get used to. The switch face is a toggle. Push the top to turn the light on and the bottom to switch it off. Now if you want to dim it, the face of the switch is a touch-sensitive pad. Just slide a finger up or down to dim. It's not quite as easy to finely control as a slider or rotating dimmer, but it's not bad.\n49#Best Light Switches out there. We have these light switches installed in most of our main living areas. They are incredibly clean looking and so satisfying to use. It’s not a hard install, simply turn off the circuit breaker to that room and swap out your switch. The wires are attached by little screws. We get compliments on our switches every time guest come over. The actually rocker switch works great but the best part is the light bar dimmer. It always glows so you can see it in the dark (brightness can be adjusted) and you slide your finger up and down the touch light bar to adjust the dimness in the room. Reliable brand, amazing product. You won’t regret these!",
