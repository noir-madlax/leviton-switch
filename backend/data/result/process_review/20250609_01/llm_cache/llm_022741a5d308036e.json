Not real white\n1#Just what I needed. Purchased this to fix issue with my bad switch works perfectly\n2#Best price. Great value bulk purchase and easy to install.\n3#Exactly what you order. Works like it should\n4#They are fine. They work as expected.\n5#A light switch. What can I say it's a light switch\n6#Strong and quiet. High quality switch, robust, strong, and quiet. You can’t go wrong with this\n7#Lightswitch. It's a working light switch. No issues.\n8#Worked perfectly. My house was built in the 70s and I’m replacing all the old wiring/outlets/switches. These worked great\n9#Worked Fine. The switches were easy to install and turn the lights on and off like they are suppose to.\n10#One did not work. Out of 5 that I purchased one did not work. My daughter installed and there was a half hour of head scratching to figure out why it wasn't working. I asked of we bought them on Amazon. Answer; yes. \"So....made in China?\" Sure enough, when she used a different one, it worked.\n11#Its only 1 switch. False advertising, only 1 was sent TWICE\n12#Exactly what they describe. Received fast.. and was correct new products. Will order agaim\n13#We use them off and on. Used it for a light switch. The first one turned the light on in the down position, off in the up position. After careful inspection, it turned out they all do that if you install them upside down. A word to the wise . . .\n14#Good bulk purchase. We had redone our switches to show white rather than beige. Have a few left over for back up. Only complaint and it's user error, they didn't have any double switch inserts. Just the singlets.\n15#Nice switch. Replace the broken switch and fit and worked fine. Have used it for several months and alls well. Good product..\n16#Awesome. Pretty good switch I’m surprised\n17#Rip-off - Do Not Buy. Ordered a 5-pack, received 1 switch.\n18#They're light switches, they switch lights. These worked perfectly for me. The only issue I had was the ground is on the opposite end from where my original switches are. Just took me a little extra time to relocate the ground wires up but no big deal.\n19#Replaced a wobbly switch. Simple enough to install. Nothing's caught on fire. Feels sturdy. Overall, I'd say I'm satisfied with it.\n20#Colour. Its a switch just install it correctly\n21#GE Switch, White, Grounding Toggle 5 Pack, Single Pole. Received as expected\n22#AS advertised. AS advertised\n23#Good Deal, as described. Good Deal, as described.\n24#GE Switch, White, Grounding Toggle 5 Pack. Easy to install. Recommend. Would buy again if we need them.\n25#Basic lightswitches. The light switches are basic,but are made sturdy to last.Instslling is very easy.\n26#Screws strip easily. These are very light weight... once of the screws holding the switch onto the box stripped with almost no pressure. However, this wasn't a deal breaker for me. They sent me Light Almond instead of White. I could not send them back, as I needed to get the bathroom back online today. However, from now forward I will buy such items locally to make certain I get what I need.\n27#Very satisfied! Very satisfied!\n28#Works and fits. Slowly changing over the outlets and wall switches in old home. These work fine.\n29#Worked great. Great for the price\n30#Works great as expected. Easy install, good value.\n31#Good quality. Easy to install, good quality, recommend\n32#Bought them for a new installation. We bought some portable buildings and needed light switches inside them. I chose these because there are a good number. All of them work and I have no complaints.\n33#Easy to install works great. Works great plenty to replace all switches in 5 rooms will buy more when when needed they are very easy to install color is perfect\n34#Quality Replacement Light Switches. Ordered to replace a couple of bad light switches in my home. Work great. Easy to install. Have spares for the next time.\n35#Easy to install. I have never installed this type, but with a little bit of strength, it was easy. It takes a good push to get the wire in. I would buy these again. Also, I read the directions.\n36#Love. All of the light switches in my house were brown I’m a new home owner I watch YouTube to learn how to install these it was very easy to install it was a little different type of in-store if you had electrical with ceiling fans but overall very easy and it gave and you look so the house\n37#Good. Works great\n38#Works as they should. Was a good price when I purchased these.They work as they should and good quality.\n39#Good product, box beaten up a bit is all but that's fine. As described\n40#Light switch. Work very well. Good product\n41#Good product. Works great. Easy to flip on & off noiselessly.\n42#The price. Right on time. Just what I needed. There where none in the stores.\n43#There light switches. Would buy them again.\n44#great switches for replacement.
