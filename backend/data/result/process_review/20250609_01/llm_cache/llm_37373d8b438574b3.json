I‚Äôm thrilled!!! works as advertised!!!\n1#It functions as advertised! They arrived quickly, very well pkg‚Äôd. Easy to install and worked just fine ! No issues what so ever. I would buy again as needed!\n2#Lighting Ease. Tap and on it comes\n3#Very useful. Work perfectly. Bought for a family member and are so useful. Purchased more for parents.\n4#Cheap. Both units had an electrical short. Great idea but not worth it.\n5#It is so easy to install! This little gadget solved the problem of where to put a lamp on my bedside table. I upgraded my bedside table, it was very unhandy where I wanted to put my lamp. I looked to Amazon for a solution and found Dewenwils' touch dimmer. Just plug your lamp into the dimmer, plug dimmer into outlet and, problem solved! I have had no problems with this handy item. You can put the on/off \"button' anywhere you want,\n6#They are great! They work great. Very convenient....ordering more.\n7#Work well. Work as advertised. I noticed that there were some reviews that indicated operational issues. They have a small computer chip, if they do not dim or there seem to be other problems, just unplug them for 5 seconds and reconnect to allow them to reboot.\n8#Extra long cord on controller. Have these in several locations around the home. Using this pair in bedroom, 0one on each side of bed. Sure beats getting out of bed to turn lights on or off.\n9#Does not Dim down very far. I had a dimmer switch that I had used for years and it finally went bad. I bought this new one from this company and I gave it only 3 stars because it does not Dim down as much as my old one that I liked using for a night light.\n10#Easy to use. It works very well. I have arthritis in my hands. It was very frustrating to try to turn the lamps on and off. These work great.\n11#It‚Äôs great üëçüèº. I love ‚ù§Ô∏è this\n12#Would not work!!!!! It would not work in any of my lamps with new bulbs in the them. Could not get them to change intensity, high or low.\n13#Didn't work straight out of the box! The package arrived today and I could not get it to work. I tried 2 different dimmable bulbs and *nothing*. The one I was replacing is 15 years old and still works, but the metal touch plate on that one is shiny brass. These will go back to Amazon\n14#What I was looking for. Easy to make lamp dim. Plug this into wall and I have a night lamp plugged into this. The touch pad is on a cord so you can set it closer. I have it on my nightstand and don‚Äôt have to get up to turn off the lamp. You touch the pad to turn on and off and to adjust dimmer.\n15#Easy to use. This was super convenient to use because it was hard to reach the top of my lamp to turn it off from bed and this made it soo much easier I love it!\n16#Love!!! Love that I could purchase a lamp base I absolutely love and pair with this purchase. Works so will!!!\n17#They are at an excellent price! These dimmers are really great! With just a nudge from my finger/s I can turn my bedside lamp on and off. Easy, peasy! Where have they been all my life?\n18#DOES NOT WORK WITH LED BULBS. I BOUGHT 2 OF THESE FOR BEDSIDE LAMPS WITH LED BULBS. THE BULBS CONSTANTLY FLICKER. I TRIED NUMEROUS WATTAGES AND BRANDS OF BULBS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. NO GO-SUPER ANNOYING!\n19#Fair. My last one allowed me to use 3 way bulbs This one restricts me to a single type bulb.\n20#Mine stopped working too. I bought a two pack and really liked them- as other reviewers mentioned, the cables are very thin and that might be why one completely stopped working after a couple of months. The other one is still working but I‚Äôm worried it won‚Äôt be for much longer.\n21#√ötil. Es muy f√°cil de operar y no ocupa nada de espacio.\n22#Working very well. I tried building my own touch switches but had trouble with sensitivity and self-triggering of the sensors. Seeing this device available I bought a pair and have implemented one. It's working flawlessly, controlling a light I've positioned on the ceiling directly above my desk. I will be deploying the other where I currently have a pull-chain light in a closet ceiling--I'll convert the fixture to an outlet, plug in this device, then plug into it a new fixture on the ceiling. I'll mount the touch sensor on the wall at standard switch height, eliminating having to wave my arms around in the dark trying to locate the pull-chain! To answer some customer questions: I tried activating the switch when wearing a nitrile glove and got no response, so I suspect it requires the capacitance of a bare touch. I dimmed my light as far as it would go, then tapped the switch to turn it off, waited a moment and then tapped the switch again to turn on the light. The light came on at its fully dimmed level, indicating that the switch does remember its last dimming state.\n23#This product works fine and as expected. Delivery was prompt. This product works fine and as expected. Delivery was prompt\n24#Works as a dimmer and ON/OFF switch. Exactly what I was looking for. Very recommendable.\n25#Three settings‚Ä¶ off, on (full brightness), and flicker. Had high hopes for this product and it couldn‚Äôt have been worse. I tried both dimmers in the package and got the same result.",
