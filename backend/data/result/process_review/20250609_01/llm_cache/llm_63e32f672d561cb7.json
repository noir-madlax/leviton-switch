As expected, it works well.\n1#Compact. Works well. Small one plate size for three separate things. Convenient.\n2#just right. These are hard to find in a store, so we were wary, but it worked just fine\n3#Works well. Cover is a lot smaller than the ones from the store so just keep that in mind.\n4#Installed and worked perfectly. I had this out of the box and replacing the defective switch I had in less than 10 min.\n5#Sturdy, well built, fits well. My old 3 gang switch had started to fall apart. This one feels much more sturdy and was a fairly easy to install replacement.\n6#Switch comes with cover so no extras to buy. I like that this switch has three individual switches and only requires a single gang box. The toggle design has a clean look about it and compliments my decor. Space saving and looks good too, what more could you ask for.\n7#Single power in switch saves room in the box. Having an older home often you find you would like to add a light or other electrically controlled item and yet you may not want to add a junction box or maybe you just want to control a couple of items from one location. This switch was perfect for what I had in mind, to control both my new flat in ceiling and LED strip for my hall. Having low amp LED's on a single hot line works out perfect for me without having to add another switch, it also has a modern look which helps to my home from feeling so dated and aged. A great option for updating your switches and fixtures.\n8#Rocker is a little too firm to push, could be smoother action. Rocker is a little too firm to push, could be smoother action\n9#Great, But ... So I like the fact that the design does have 1 input and 3 outputs making it easier to install (making sure, of course, your breaker can handle all three and your local code doesn't warn you off from this). What I didn't like about it, was the switching action itself. Turning each switch off was normal and decently quiet. Turning each switch on was a bit more of a mechanical hassle and noisier. I cycle each one multiple times prior to installing to see if it was just a manufacturing issue. For me testing, I did hook up lights to each output and they all worked just fine and there was no draw through the switch when all three were activated. I gave it 5 stars, but really wanted to give it 4 due to the mechanics of the switch and not testing longevity of the switch over a longer period of time to see if the unit will fail or short out, etc.\n10#Functional, but switch feel could be better. The switch(es) function like you would expect. Install was easy with the clamp style terminals. And the UL listing provides some extra piece of mind. Having a triple rocker in a single gang allows me to add other interesting components to my box, such as a nightlight and proximity sensor. The only thing I think could be improved is the feel of the rockers. There is a bit of play in the rocker before you get to the forceful part of the activation. The inconsistent feel from off to on makes it feel a bit cheap. None of my other rocker style switches exhibit this behavior, so it is quite noticeable. But, let's be honest, for the price of three separate switches and the space savings, this AIDA triple rocker is a pretty good value.",
