I'm having issues connecting with the Kasa app on my Pixel 9. I downloaded the app on my MacBook Air and that works perfectly. I have seen more reviews complaining about connection issues on their phones. The switch works great.\n1#TP-Link Smart Switches Are Garbage – Built to Break, Total Scam. I've bought 12 TP-Link smart light switches over the past 3-4 years. Two weeks ago, one just stopped working. I figured, okay, stuff happens. But then—boom—another one dies the following week. The day after that? A third one goes out. That’s three failures in under two weeks. Out of curiosity, I checked TP-Link’s website. Surprise, surprise: the warranty is only 1–2 years. Guess what? All three failed right after the warranty expired. These things aren’t defective — they’re engineered to fail once you’re no longer covered. That’s not a coincidence. That’s a planned-obsolescence scam. These smart switches are not “smart”—they’re a stupid waste of money. Regular light switches last 10–20 years, while these overpriced plastic toys can’t even last two. DO NOT BUY these switches. I don’t care how fancy the app is or what brand it is — TP-Link or otherwise. If it needs replacing every couple of years, it’s trash. Stick with old-school switches. They’re cheap, reliable, and they don’t leave you in the dark — literally.\n2#Easy to Install. Switch was easy to install and the app was easy to use.\n3#3-way lighting setups with smart functionality. The Kasa Smart 3-Way Switch HS210 KIT is a solid choice for those looking to integrate smart lighting into their homes, especially in areas like stairways and hallways where 3-way switches are common. For those seeking dimming capabilities or alternatives that don't require a neutral wire, other models like the Kasa Smart Dimmer Switch HS220 or the GE Cync Smart Dimmer may be worth considering\n4#Works very well and easy to install. Works great. So easy to install.\n5#Great idea for a product but doesn't work with lights on GFCI circuit. Seems like a great idea but because my light is connected to GFCI switch, I couldn't use it because it would trip the switch every time I turned the power on. So I can't comment on its features. But I do use single ones and those are great. Quality items with great features.\n6#Failed in less than 2 months. Easy install. Worked great...for al.ost 2 months, then died completely. Wouldn't work through app and wouldn't work by pressing rocker switch either. Reset failed 4 times. Tapo makes customer pay return shipping on their broken cheap asian junk. Skip this product and probably the company too\n7#Does work with Alexa routines to turn of lights. I cannot make it work with Alexa routines\n8#Both switches on 1 circuit didn’t work for me. I installed both of these on a 3-way circuit and it rarely worked. I took one out and put the old switch back in, now it seems to work more reliably. The problem is I want the switches to have a consistent look. I get that it’s cheaper to use just 1 smart switch in a 3-way circuit. When I asked online everyone said don’t put both together. Fine, then sell me a smart switch and a dumb switch that look the same.\n9#Durability is bad. Lasted for about two years and started failing one by one. Purchased about 20 of the 3way switches about two years ago and they started failing one by one. Tried restart, reset, reinstall none of these work. The durability is really a concern for this product.\n10#Convenient. Easy to install, connects to my network with easy, directions easy to follow and it works with Alexa for my convenience.\n11#Trouble with install and daily use. These are frustrating to install and use. I purchases two boxes of this item. One I used for the top and bottom of the stairs. I was unable to use one of the switches because of the electrical run. The switch works, but now one of the switches does not match the others. The second pair I purchased for the foyer. This set could not find the signal, even though other switches in the same box connected fine. It will flash orange and green but not set up. Sometimes the foyer light will come on, on its own. Sometimes the switch won't work manually. Come prepared with an extra level of patience to deal with this set up. I still haven't been able to get it to operate as expected.\n12#Little frustrated. First issue, had these been labeled as \"frequently returned\" when I purchased them like they are now, I wouldn't have. This message didn't appear for me until after I had and installed them then proceeded to waste time discovering the quirks for myself. The switches themselves work well enough, however the entire reason I purchased these is for compatibility with my Home Assistant based smart home. These will not work without using the KASA or other cloud based apps and what I want is something compatible with my locally hosted Home Assistant. Since I have other KASA products, I mistakenly purchased these thinking they were Matter compatible, but they are not. All my other KASA switches use Matter so it was an easy mistake to make. Problem two is they don't reliably report their status to the KASA app which defeats the purpose of using the app in the first place. This is a problem since I don't want multiple cloud based apps that don't mingle controlling devices for my smart home. This means everything must be separate or I have to stay in one ecosystem and can't take advantage of the best products from whoever makes them. The positives: the installation was easy and I like the touch style switches. I like the halo when the switch is off and how they match other switches in the house. I also like that regardless of which switch was used to control the light, they both look the same. Two switches in different positions to control the same light / device is one of my annoyances with a 3-way light setup using typical north American lever switches.\n13#Couldn’t get both switches to work on the App. Very Difficult to set up. It’s working, but I couldn’t get both switches to work in the KASA App. I really didn’t need both switches to work in the App, but this app has one switch showing up as not adopted. I tried standing right in front of the switch and my phone said that I had FULL SIGNAL\n14#great product. great product for smart home use\n15#Great Smart Switches. These are excellent! I have 10 of these switches in my home, and I've had no problem installing them or using them. Works as designed and described. I have 3-way switches and single-pole switches.\n16#Almost 5 stars. Work well most of the time. Some times one of them will click on, then right back off. Not a lot, but on occasion. Other units work great. I do have to speak slowly to Alexa sometimes. Also remember to use 2.4ghz wifi on your phone to set these up, or you'll be cussing :D\n17#Excellent. Love this item and is very easy to use. App is very easy to set up and use and set up a schedule!\n18#FALSE ADVERTISEMENT SOLD AS NEW. Product was sold as new and even had a clear sticker on box as if it was new. PRODUCT WAS USED. When i try to add ig to my profile both switches said that switxh was assigned to a different account and if i wanted to reset it. One switch did not have the clear plastic on the face of the switch and had scuff marks all over. Unknow how long they were used for befire product was sold as new again.\n19#affordable!! Easy to install. Works great! Linked up to Alexa just fine!! I like the numerous setting options!\n20#Firmware update is hard. It took me forever to update the firmware. Sometimes, it would say that the device was update and I would check, and it would not be updated at all. The device was more stable after the firmware update, but it still disconnects from WIFI a lot. When it does connect, the device works as indicated. I would not advise purchasing this device because it should not be this difficult to update the firmware and you never know when it will disconnect from WIFI.\n21#I've tried to make it work, many times, with no luck. I own about 50 kasa switches, I put them all over my 5000sq foot house. No issues installing the other models know the process well. However these 3-way switches just are such a pain. I have two I got installed and they work about 88% of the times, sometimes they just seem to get lost on how to control the light, or have to be reset. I have others I can't control at all. I paid for an electrician to come behind me and see what I'm doing wrong and he couldn't get this one to work either. Said it was just \"confusing\" I love the other kasa switches, but this one just doesn't seem to hit the mark.\n22#Works perfectly! Make sure to find the NEUTRAL wire! :). This product worked perfectly, once it was installed correctly! Connecting this to the Neutral is key and making sure you identify the Neutral is imperative. When I opened up the electrical box that had 3 total switches, I only opened up the far left box. That was the one I was replacing with this product. I saw a gray wire, which can sometimes represent the Neutral, so I connected the white wire from this Kasa switch to that gray wire. When I flipped the breaker on, it just tripped immediately. Upon further review, I read that sometimes, the Neutrals are just sort of placed in the back of the electrical box...out of the way. So I then took off the remaining 2 light switches and sure enough, tucked away in the back right were white wires...all twisted together with the wire nut. I found the neturals! After some maneuvering, I connected the Kasa white neutral to the neutrals in the box...flipped the breaker and everything worked. Setup was a breeze and I'm really loving the \"vacation\" feature to make it seem like we're home when we're not. Any deterrence is good deterrence! And to confirm, I only swapped out ONE of the three-way switches. I still have traditional toggle on the other side of the garage where we installed this. So no need to install BOTH switches for one 3-way switch light. Highly recommend and I may now have to swap out more smart switches in the house!\n23#They just work! Love these smarts switches! Why? Because they just work! Power outages, wifi problems, you name it as soon as they are able, they reconnect and just work as if nothing happened. I have over 20 of these installed in my house and have been totally trouble free since the spring of 2022. I have had them tied to google home and Alexa through multiple accounts it has been totally seamless. However, If I am being critical I would point out the mechanical side of the switch feels somewhat cheap and doesn't not give a satisfying click when pressed. Also the switch is quite bulky on the backside make sure you have plenty of space in your switch boxes, making room for this extra bulk is the most time consuming and tedious part of the install if your boxes are already crowded\n24#can't get it to work with 3 switches. this isn't really a review but combination review/question. i have a circuit for outside flood lights that are controlled by 3 switches - 2 3-way and 1 4-way. when i install this the circuit works fine if i use this switch. if i use one of the others this switch will start flashing the lights and the only way to stop it is to unwire it. i've seen other reviews that say it should work fine in this situation but i don't know what i'm doing wrong. do i need a 4-way and replace the 4-way in the circuit? does this need to be the first switch in the circuit? any help would be appreciated.\n25#One Major Flaw. With the 3 way switch. Whichever switch you manually turn off the lights with, this is the only switch that you can manually turn the lights back on with. For example I have one switch by the hallway and one by the front door for the living room lights. If I turn off the lights at the front door, I can’t turn them back on with the switch near the hallway. I have to use the one by the front door again. Voice commands will not work if I turned the lights off on one switch and then try to turn them on with the other switch. It disables the entire thing.\n26#Poor setup. Set up instructions and app are poorly written and designed. Devices would not connect or pair. Would not function correctly even when using manual switch button\n27#Laggy and unresponsive. I’ve been using Kasa smart switches and the Deco TP-Link A5400 mesh WiFi for over two years, and overall, I’m extremely disappointed. Despite both products being from the same brand, the Kasa app is consistently laggy, slow, and unreliable. Even with a strong network connection, the app struggles to respond, making smart home control frustrating. The biggest issue is connectivity. The Deco A5400 mesh system itself has been unstable, frequently dropping connections or failing to properly integrate with Kasa devices. I’ve tried every troubleshooting method—resetting, repositioning nodes, firmware updates—but nothing has provided a long-term fix. To make matters worse, Google Home integration is unreliable at best, with devices often appearing offline or responding inconsistently to voice commands. For a smart home ecosystem, reliability is crucial, and TP-Link has not delivered. If you’re looking for a seamless smart switch and mesh WiFi combination, I’d strongly recommend looking at other brands.\n28#Smart 3 Way Switch. These are awesome. I added some in ceiling lights and needed an additional switch. Used these to add some modern controls and make them smart. Now I can turn lights on and off remotely, put them on a schedule if needed and just manage them if a child forgets to turn any one of them off. Well worth the cost and time.\n29#UPDATED: Bad instructions, but decent switches. I originally wrote that this product \"is SO irritating. I didn't figure this out until after a very long time of installation frustration\" and that \"the description should be clearer\". I remain convinced that the instructions leave much, much to be desired. BEFORE installing these, first go to YouTube videos that explain how three-way switches work and the installation method for these in a \"stand alone\" position. You'll save yourself hours. Kasa needs to get its act together on the instruction side of things, but the product is solid. I literally wasted hours and hours before doing that.\n30#Does not fit in 4\" steel electrical boxes. Pair of 3-way switches appears to work fine. However, no instructions. Video is not very enlightening. However, largest problem is that the switch housing prevents it from being installed in standard 4\" steel electrical boxes. So, why is this a problem? If you have a steel electrical box (common in basements and garages) the steel cover mounting screws are covered by the switch housing and the housing is too long to fit inside the box. The 4\" box has to be removed and a larger box installed. Not impossible, but unnecessary if tp-link had reduced the plastic flange so it fits inside standard electrical boxes.\n31#Only lasted 4 years. 4 years vs old switchs that last decades\n32#Schedule to turn off does not work. I installed it, can turn on off manually. Set schedule to auto turn on and off. It is able to turn on following schedule but it does not turn off with schedule\n33#Missing Screw. Arrived missing a which is a key component to the electrical system making this extremely dangerous. Can't believe this is sold like this.\n34#3-way switch rapid on/off flickers lights after 3 years. My initial rating in 2021 was 5 stars easy due to the price and ease of installation. I am finally able to write a follow up after having the 3-way wifi setup installed in multiple rooms since fall of 2021. Since then, 2 different 3 way switches (2 out of 4 in the pairs) have gone into constant on/off mode. The switch turns itself on and off continually and all the lights its connected to on and off. This is happening RAPIDLY -- maybe 2 on/off cycles every second! No amount of Restarts or Resets of the switch resolve the issue. All devices have the latest firmware. Granted, the warranty is only 2 years for these devices and they tend to crap out on the dot every 3 years, but is having to replace 1 of the 2 switches every 3 years worth it considering a traditional 3-way switch works until the rest of time?\n35#Unbelievable Hassel. I have several Kasa switches and for the most part they work great. However, I had one HS210 not working and tech support for the most part answered the phone call right away. They were miserable to work with to replace a $15.00 switch. It’s been awhile saying that I never sent back the paperwork they requested. I sent it twice, then they wanted more. The paper work was unbelievable and then they wanted to send me the part and RMA It. I told them forget it keep your 15.00 part because it just was worth the hassle.\n36#Instructions are so bad, may never know if it works! I have no idea if it works or not. The instructions are worthless. No way to wire it in, based on the instructions. I have used the app for 4 years. I have 62 Kasa or TP link products on the app. I love them all. I WILL NEVER BUY A KASA SWITCH AGAIN. On top of that, I clicked in my orders to find this switch, and it is not even the right product. I cannot find instructions for my product, however, the user guide says it is for my product.\n37#Work great. Happy with all the Kasa products I have. I have many of these all over my house and they have been super reliable for years! They connect without any issues to Alexa and Home Assistant. On/off time is almost instant and I haven't had any problems with them at all. They work with the standard 3-way switch at the other end, so you only need 1 of these per two switches!\n38#Great option to automate a 3 way switch. I used this to replace a much older KASA 3 way switch that started acting strangely. This was clearly a newer version as the wiring is reversed on the back. So I'm hopeful it lasts a long long time. It was easy to hook up. You only need 1 per double switch setup, meaning one of the existing 3 way switches in the system can stay. It works like a momentary switch for on and off of the lamp being controlled. Everything worked as expected.\n39#Easy 3-Way Switch Setup. This Kasa smart switch kit is a great solution for 3-way lighting setups (just remember, it’s for 2-switch control, not 4-way with 3 switches). Installation was straightforward with the step-by-step guide in the app, and it connected seamlessly to Alexa. Works exactly as expected, and I had no issues. If you need a reliable 3-way smart switch, this is a great choice!\n40#Don’t last. Spend the money and buy better switches instead of Kasa, they will stop working and you’ll need to buy a new one because they don’t back their product and you’ll end up spending more than a quality one.\n41#Great with Google home. Love this! I highly recommend as we have it sync with our Google home.\n42#Works great with Alexa. Works great, make sure to purchase this hs210 if you have a red trip wire and the light is controlled from two switches. I bought the hs200 first which only does a single switch and didn’t work.\n43#WiFi connection issues. Jobert was able to help me isolate issue quickly and courteously. Short answer for others that are having Wi-Fi connection issues....Change your WiFi setting to the Kasa/TP switch. Once configured the WiFi will default back to your home setting.\n44#Great product! Ok so keep in mind you need to know a little bit about wires / travel wires to install this. Took a bit of googling but was able to get it working. I ended up splitting the set on 2 3way switches instead of both on one. The only drawback back to this is if turned off with the manual switch the app may not pick up they are off. No big deal hit the button again. Love TP link! Replacing all my switches etc as I go and they only get better as I go.\n45#Awesome Product. I am very pleased with the quality of this product. I would suggest doing research on how to install and test f your not comfortable, hire a professional. I was able to install and connect with the KASA app. Very user friendly.\n46#Excellent technical support. Tech support was excellent. I had problems connecting smart switch to WIFI network.\n47#Works great. Good quality. No complaints yet. I have used Kasa products and I am very satisfied with quality, packaging, instructions, app design.\n48#Needed customer service for setup. Simple install, worked flawlessly as a mechanical switch, but I had to get in touch with customer service to complete my install because one step, linking to Wi-Fi, was absent in the online and in the box instructions. I have to say that the customer service rep, Paul, was incredibly efficient and was able to immediately get me to appropriately set up the equipment, which now works just fine. Very reasonable price, not needing to use a hub is excellent, and their customer service was outstanding.\n49#Great smart switches! It’s been 2 years now. I’ve had these switches installed on my home for about 2 years now. They’ve been great! Installation was easy and the integration with the Kasa app is seamless. At random times they disconnect from my internet for some reason, but it has only happened a handful of times. Overall, pretty satisfied and would buy again.",
