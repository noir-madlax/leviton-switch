Bought this to be able to turn off the outside lights from my detached garage form the house once in. The distance is about 80 feet. It only worked intermittently. I'm sure it would work great room to room, but don't think you are going to get 100 ft out of it as advertised.\n1#Doesn't work completely. Installed it. One remote works, the other doesn't. No way to contact seller, website has a dead email address.\n2#Works somewhat. Okay after carefully considering everyone's review, and I always take them with a grain of salt, I purchased these and installed the box in the light switch across the hall and the receivers are in the garage. One is 3 ft away the other is about 20 feet away through a wall. At first they only worked 10% of the time. I would push the button and nothing would happen. All 4 buttons (up and down on either remote) have a very tactile feedback and an audible click. Turns out you really kind of have to hold the button for a second in order for it to work at all. Almost never will it work if you tap it quickly. Occasionally I'll still get one not wanting to activate the lights if I hold it. in the grand scheme of things it's not that bad, but that is the absolutely most annoying feeling in the world, hitting a button, hearing it click, seeing the button light up, and nothing happens. It seems like when they are throwing a fit, time or hitting the other remote has been the only thing that works for me. My issue was no light switches in the garage, this gave me light switches that work, somewhat. Am I ecstatic? No. Is it a cheaper alternative to having an electrician come wun new wire and install a switch? Definitely. Just wish they worked every time. Biggest downfall is doing the work to install a solution that only works 80-90% of the time.\n3#1 of 2 switch modules did not function. Functional distance less than 20 feet. There are two switch modules. One is bad and drains the battery in minutes. The other switch module and main receiver function fine. Cost $17.00, really not worth my time to return it as I live in the country. Update 03/14/25 discovered that the receiver and one working switch module only function if within 20 feet of each other. Even with receiver is outside of wall box. Don’t purchase.\n4#BUY THE UPGRADED VERISON!!! The product was easy to install, however, having installed several of these wireless switches by this brand, I HIGHLY recommend going with the upgraded version for the extra $10 because even only 5' away, this switch has a hard time working properly. Either the transmitter is not receiving the signal, or the vice versa. Will be returning this and going back to the upgraded version.\n5#Works… most times. Would still recommend. Im only giving this 4 stars because, as others have pointed out, sometimes the switch doesn’t seem to work. Note something though, this is not an ordinary on/off switch that you can feel when the switch flips up or down. This is more of a push button switch, so that design may have to do with the “delayed” response. For me, it works 95% of the times and I’m happy with that.\n6#Happy with this. One of the 2 switches was a little smudged and dirty, but that's ok, since this was a USED pre-bought item at a discounted price. Quality seems just fine. Install was fairly easy for someone handy, and works fine so far, only two days in.\n7#It’s junk. It is absolutely junk quit working after 1 day had it replaced the replacement lasted 2 days returned for refund\n8#Worth my money. I had a pull down closet light with no light switch. This was a prefect switch and easy to install. I do recommend flat surface light fixtures is the option because anything else might over fill the light box.\n9#Best Money Spent!!! Worth Every Penny! So easy to install and saved us a bunch of money in not having to rewire and move the existing switch! Worth every penny!\n10#Worked great for a job. I had a job where no existing 3 way switch was and needed one to meet code in a old 1930's home.\n11#GREAT PRODUCT. GREAT PRODUCT\n12#Lights won’t turn off. It seems like the range of the switch / receiver has to be very close. I have the switches installed at a distance of about 15’. Sometimes it works to turn on / off. Other times I have to take the switch off the wall and get closer to the receiver. Just doesn’t do it for me. Also the look and feel is kind of weird.\n13#It works some of the time. Only a few feet away from the light and I have to take it off the wall and put it in a clear line of sight (basement stairwell) to the light for it to turn off.\n14#Not working all that well. Placement of where I wanted the switch would not work well. Even switched switches and did not work any better\n15#Easy. MUCH better than running 3 wire Romex in the crawl space!\n16#It turns on a remote outlet in the neighboring room. We have this remote switch installed in one room, and another remote outlet installed in the neighboring bedroom. When we press this switch, it turns on the one in the other bedroom. Update: it works now after reprogramming. We’ll keep watching. So far it’s good. Occasionally, the signal is not sent, and so not turning on the light.\n17#Poor connection. The switch is literally 10 feet away and the signal is still spotty.\n18#IMPORTANT: Avoid Putting the Receiver In a Metal Wall Box. Previously I had recommended to remove your old wall switch, throw it away, hide the new controller in the wall box where the old switch was, put one of the new switches over the box, and put the second new switch wherever you want it. BUT, THE WALL BOX MUST NOT BE METAL. A metal wall box will interfere with the controller's wireless signals to the switches. You can test this by operating the wall switches with the controller in the box and out of the box. In case your wall box is metal and interferes with the wireless signals, simply cut a small rectangular hole in the Sheetrock below, put the controller inside, cover the hole with thin cardboard, disguise with a small amount of drywall compound, and paint same as the wall.\n19#Sticks out. Can be a little finicky. It beats the heck out of having to rewire a light fixture for a three-way. But in the end the result sticks out a 3/4 inch from the wall. The off button on one of them is a bit finicky. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. If you press it 5 times it’ll usually turn off.\n20#Good costume service. Easy for installation.\n21#Perfect. Saved me hours and a lot of money on supplies to convert a single pole switch in my shop to be able and control it from 2 places.\n22#Usually works, if you are close. I am unsure why they don't list \"Works to the Moon.\" 100 feet? That is like explaining length to a woman you are trying to pick up. How about 20 feet, with a line of sight, and it \"usually\" works. If your application is a switch in a small room, this may be a cost-effective option, but if you want something reliable with some range, you will probably want one of the more expensive options. Spoiler alert: the more expensive options are worth the money....\n23#Works OK disappointed!!!! Flaky controls. sometimes doens't work well. works OK Disappointed!!!!!!!!!! sometimes works fine and sometimes you have to play with the on off for it to work\n24#Worked sporadically. I installed one switch about 35’ away (in garage) and it worked fine. The other switch was 5’ away and wouldn’t work unless you took it down from the wall and held it about two feet from the light and even then I had to keep trying the switch over and over. Finally took it down and threw it away. I have it two stars for the concept.\n25#Works as described. Put this in for three way switch to my garage. Went in easily and works great.\n26#Wont turn off. I installed this wireless switch on August 28 to replace three way wall wiring that had become problematic. The installation went as directed in the instructions and the wall switches looked nice. The light comes on nicely from each of the two switches. The problem is getting the light turned off. On occasion it will turn off on the first try and occasionally it will turn off after many tries. The only sure way to turn it off is to take the switch off the wall, hold it about 18” from the light then click off. I love the idea of the wireless switch but this model has not worked well for us\n27#Easy to install. Was easy to install and works great.\n28#Cheap for a reason. Installation is quick and easy. The switches work, however, they don’t turn off with a single tap. I’ve had to hold down the off button on the switch for a few seconds to get it to turn off. Returning.\n29#One switch does not work. One of the switches across the room works great, the other it right next to the device and just doesn’t work\n30#Excelente opción. Es muy práctico para apagar un equipo o bombilla desde dos ubicaciones distintas, funciona muy bien, lo mejor de todo es que tienen un soporte fenomenal.\n31#It works perfectly. Works as advertised.\n32#Its ok. Short Distances Only. This device works but the distance is not that great. I would recommend for 30-40ft. The description says a 100, but that would be in a vacuum with totally unobstructed space. My use is about a 40ft distance on opposite sides of a shared wall (switch indoor, module outdoor, same wall, 1 at each end, 40 ft apart) and its very lossy. The OFF channel deffinently has a shorter range than the ON channel. At the same distance the switch would turn on but not off. Sometime I have to hold down the switch until it turns on/off. Overall I'll see how it does over the next couple of weeks, but the \"100ft\" is overrated.\n33#Solved my problem! When I walked into my laundry room, I would always hit the wall to my left but there was no switch, the switch is on the other side of the room! This switch was easy to install and gave me the ability to put a switch where my brain always wants it to be!\n34#Turns on instantly, but need to take remote off wall to turn off. Turns the lights on instantly from anywhere, but turning off is not consistent. A couple times it turned off immediately, but then I realized those were the times that I was holding the remote closer to the receiver. The only thing I've found that consistently works is to take the remote off the wall and point it at the receiver (like a TV remote) to turn off the lights. Holding it vertically in the *exact* same place doesn't work! Both switches have issues, but sometimes just one or the other, depending on how I orient the receiver (the walls they're on are at right angles to each other). Initially I had it hanging out of a j-box above the garage door motor (receiver flat/horizontal), then got different behavior with the receiver vertical (like it is when packed into the box). The relative orientations of transmitters (switches) and receiver seems to matter, but I wasn't able to find one that worked consistently for both switches. Both switches have line-of-sight from two corner doorways to the center (ceiling) of a two-car garage (15 feet?).\n35#Almost perfect. My minor complaints are: 1-the mounting/housing needs to be a bit wider to fully cover an existing box. 2-Once in a while, the first tap doesn't work. Bought to solve the builder's bad idea of switch placement. This allowed me to place one switch by the door into the room, and to still have a switch in the original location. It would have been nice if they made the switch unit be able to mount in a standard switch plate(I wasn't bold enough to tear it apart to see if I could modify it).\n36#Easy to install. This was the perfect solution to our entry way hall that only had a switch on one end. Installation took only a few minutes and it works like a charm! The only negatives are that the switches aren’t very aesthetically pleasing and one of them is a little finicky about where you have to press the button to get it to activate. Those things aside, it was an easy and effective solution for a minor inconvenience that I was obsessed with fixing…. (I used Command strips to mount on the wall instead of screwing the plates in and it has worked great.)\n37#Remote control light switch. Works like a champ. Easy install and setup. Time saving three way install\n38#Good Product for Price. Good quality product for the price range. Works quite well, tends to give some trouble when switching on and off however.\n39#Sometimes works. Does not consistently respond to on/off switch.\n40#What a pleasure not having to hard wire. This is an amazing option to installing a hard wired 3-way switch. This used to be a big deal to do with wires and getting into walls. You can't make it any easier.\n41#doesn't work. Buy a different brand, this one doesn't work. I intentionally ordered 2 different brands because the installation cost more then the produce. The other brand worked perfectly. This brand couldn't handle being 30 inches from the light switch.\n42#Works but not well. Kinda crappy even in small rooms used better before\n43#Easy to install and works well. Simple installation. Versatile switch placement.\n44#Easy & Nice. Easy to wire in and attach the wall plates. Highly recommend for pull chain light replacements.\n45#Solved impossible wiring problem. Had a light switch nearly inaccessible behind an air handler. Replaced the switch with bluetooth sender and then placed two \"remote\" receivers at each of two locations. Would have been impossible to run wiring to achieve the same result. Looks just like a regular \"deco\" light switch.\n46#Interruptor. Muy bueno y sin cable se me ISO fácil se los recomiendo ah todo\n47#Dissatisfied. Great design if it worked constantly. Having to push on and off two or three times for the connection to be made even when the switch is right next to the box. Very annoying. Even change batteries in the switches. Still the same problem\n48#It is super hard to turn off. This item I installed today and the two switches is inly about 7.5 feet apart. Turn on is great, but the switch at 7.5 feet is very hard to turn off. You have to hit 7 or 8 times to turn it off. Since it is wireless, I swap the two switches. And still the closer switch has no problem and the 7.5 feet switch is not turning off. That swap indicates it is a product design issue, not an individual defect issue.",
