It will be a perfect switch if it has a better brightness.\n1#good value. as expected\n2#Easy installation, works perfectly, looks great. Works great, very even lighting within switch and multiple connection options makes for a very easy installation. Looks very nice in the dark but like any ordinary paddle switch in a lighted room. Now I can find that elusive switch in the dark as I stumble in to make my coffee in the early morning. Reasonable price.\n3#Professional Design. I bought another brand of these and was disappointed by the poor design where you could see the led directly through a gap between the decora paddle and the frame. These were definitely made by someone who knows design. The light is just bright enough to be seen through the paddle and without a gap at the top to see the LED. Bonus is that they have a much nicer feel when turned on/off.\n4#Good product. Worked perfectly for my needs. Good price. Arrived quickly\n5#Find the light switch when dark. Got this for my garage to replace old toggle switch, as I prefer decors switches. This lights up when off, so can see the button in the dark to turn light on (which is the whole reason I got this particular switch) Very happy with my purchase\n6#works as needed. added two switchs to my computer desk to controll overhead light and power for other devices.\n7#Working well. Bought this for an illuminated switch in the attic. House was wired before it was required to put the attic light switch at ground level, so it's at the top of the stairs. It's nice to have it illuminated instead of fumbling around in the dark looking for it.\n8#Weird pulsating light. Very dim hard to see and the light pushes weirdly\n9#Easy to install - disappointing level of illumination. Wanted to remind me if basement lights behind a door were left on in an otherwise often illuminated area - not good for that.\n10#Works well. Dim light is perfect. Dim light to show switch is perfect and not too bright. Feels well built. Don't forget to buy a cover like me\n11#Good. Bought many times.\n12#Excellent lighting. Provides great lighting to the paddle switch. Looks nice and very functional\n13#Works Perfectly. I bought this to replace a light switch in our \"water closet\" because there are no plugs for a night light. there is just the right amount of light to see in the middle of the night without being so bright it blinds you.\n14#Works as expected. Based on other reviews we were worried that it would produce too much or little light or that the light would be awkward around the switch, but it has actually worked really well. Glad we took the chance and went with it. We have a dark blue bathroom which makes seeing the light switch difficult. This is a perfect amount of light, the switch is easy to find and the install was easy. It would be great if they moved to an insert the wire/click install like newer switches, but not expected since many are still at a traditional install. We would recommend.\n15#Acceptable but not bright enough. Not has bright describe on the website very low .\n16#Okay at best. Expected a better illuminated switch from Leviton.\n17#Good switch. Works great. Nice illuminating switch.\n18#Pretty nice. Looks great. I used it for a ceiling fan. Is it worth 3x the cost of a regular switch? Probably not, but this is for for a simple rocker switch.\n19#Works well enough. Works exactly as needed. Note this is not bright enough to double as a night light but it is handy to help you find the right switch at night. Install was easy.\n20#Works great. Works great\n21#Quality products. Needed a lighted switch in our bathroom.\n22#Dim. I’ve seen others and this barely has any light emitted; in complete darkness it’s ok, but with I’d gotten a different brand\n23#No more searching for the light switch. Easy to install, not too bright or too dim...no more searching for the switch in the dark.\n24#Very Dim. I replaced a 20 year old switch with a light that was flickering. This new light is so weak it'a a joke.\n25#Works great. I can find the light switch in a dark garage!\n26#Perfect for older electrical light switches. My house is old and some of the electrical switches and outlets are old. My light switch does not have a neutral wire, it only has 2 wires. This switch does not require a neutral wire, which is exactly what I needed. I didn’t need a “nightlight” or a bright light because this switch is in my walk-in closet. I just needed a light that would help me locate the switch and this is perfect! Very easy to install. Light is a cool white, not a warm light. The switch looks like any switch, you don’t know there’s a light there until it’s off & dark. Great switch for a great price.\n27#Great buy. Easy to install and works great. Seems to be a quality product\n28#Works well, but...... One of my leviton decora switches in a bank of three, lost its illumination. All of the old leviton switches used a nice orange glow. When they switch to LED, for some reason they selected a harsh white. I wish they would use LEDs that somewhat match the old switches as replacing one in a bank of three looks absolutely horrible. Not to mention the pure white light is not pleasant on the eyes\n29#Received a faulty, used item... Item received was in used condition with a garage sale tag no less still attached to the crushed box... Missing screws and has a faulty illumination switch. Could have been a fire hazard to someone not knowing what they are looking at and installed it.\n30#Great in the bathroom. Got this to replace old one in bathroom. Works great and good night lite, easy to find in dark.\n31#Great Switches. There’s not much to say about a light switch…This one works great as expected. My original switch glowed orange when it was turned off, it was in a bathroom and offered some light to see in the dark. I could not find the orange switches anywhere. These glow white but it’s not overwhelming, it is in no way a nightlight. It offers just enough glow to locate it in a dark room.\n32#Perfect For a Dark Area. Installed to control garage lights in a garage with no windows. Glows just bright enough that it is easy to find. Don't expect it to be a night light. I always have good luck with Levitron switches.\n33#Just As Expected. Just the right amount of brightness, not overly bright nor too dim. Easy enough to install.\n34#Works as it should. Was a bit pricey.\n35#What a great light. What a great light switch. The light switch keeps you from having to put a nightlight in your bathroom and using one of the outlets. The light is not excessively bright; just enough to see where you are and where the switches are. I bought several.\n36#White Light. I was bought up with orange glow illuminated paddle light switches. These are a nice improvement, glowing white and are easy to spot in a dark room.\n37#Gold value. Was what was promised\n38#Do your self a favor..! Swapped out my bathroom switch with this \"night light\" version. Now, no more having to turn on the light use the bathroom in the middle of the night...!!\n39#Electrons have met their match — I can control you. Check your circuit before buying this. If it is 20AMP, buy a 20AMP rated switch. Yah, you are allowed a 15AMP, but don’t cheap it out.\n40#Good high-quality uses minimal space inside of the electrical box. Installed in seconds. Appears to be very well-made. The LED light is rather dim though. It would make it easy to find in a dark room, but not suitable as a nightlight.\n41#Good Visibility. Needed a lighted light switch due to having double doors to the office. Makes it easy to see in the dark!\n42#It works. It works good.\n43#Excellent buy, the light on the switch is dim enough where it does not bother you enough that you can at least see it when you walk into a dark room\n44#blueish-white illumination doesn't match other switches! Nice switch with good wire contacts, but the color was a shock to us. Can't mix these with older switches (unless you want to 'color code' I guess). BTW, If using it to switch an outlet like we did it doesn't light up unless something is plugged in - with the tiniest load such as a lamp or power strip it lights up as expected.\n45#Worked great. Works as intended. These draw less current than their neon counterparts. They, somehow magically, illuminate very dimly with NOTHING plugged into the outlet - wheras their neon counterparts were completely dark. Additionally, whereas their neon counterparts would illuminate very dimly with an LED load, these will illuminate at full brightness with all of the LED loads I've experienced. They're just really really expensive for my liking...\n46#Like it. If you have 2 light switches in a dark hallway like me, this single pole won’t work. I didn’t know that you need a double pole. Not super bright, but it lets you know where the switch is. They don’t carry them on display at my Home Depot, glad Amazon has them\n47#Works great. my brother used these when he installed lights in my backyard. They work great. No complaints.\n48#Not as bright as the pics. Great light switch, less than mediocre light. It’s very dim.",
