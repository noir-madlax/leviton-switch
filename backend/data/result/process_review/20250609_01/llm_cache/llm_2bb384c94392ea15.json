Does not completely shut off LED light. Which makes it useless. If being fully off relies on running the dimmer circuit then this would be a power vampire device.\n1#...it got a short so I threw it out. ...learn not to burn\n2#Highly recommend. Works as intended.\n3#Works great. Not cheaply made works great.\n4#It Dims.... This item was bought because the lighting store I took my vintage floor lamp to didn't want to install a dimmer (as I requested) into the new wiring. Instead, they went online - printed out the page for this product and told me to order it instead of them doing the job they agreed to do. The quality seems ok - I'm not sure how the sliding dimmer switch will hold up long term. The lamp is something I don't use everyday but is set up in a reading nook in my office. Time will tell about it's longevity and durability. It seems a bit plasticy - but everything seems that way now a day. At the end of the day - it does dim the lamp (which is what I purchased it to do). I'll update this review in the future once I've had a chance to use it more.\n5#Really works! Eaasy fix! This a simple device which actually works and is a no brainer to hook up. Solved the problem of having to take the lamp in for a very expensive repair.\n6#Easy to use & setup. Replaced one Very old and failing…this is smooth sliding & no blinking at any points from minimum to maximum\n7#Intermittant bulb flicker. At first it seemed to work just fine, but as time went on, I'd experience bulb flickering once in a while. I wanted to try a different brand of LED bulbs, but my SO didn't want to change. We hardly ever used the dimming, so it was removed and is now unused.\n8#100% does not work. 100% of power delivers a fraction of total power. No way to set.\n9#Great service. Replaced an older, outdated version. Working well.\n10#Works as expected. No-brainer to use, looks good, works great.\n11#Dimmer switches are like sandwiches...imsorrynevermind. I've been trying to be funny. I finally got my medication and I don't care what I'm typing. I'll do more of these another time. Oh yeah, no these dimmer switches are imperative for mood lighting. I think the ability to adjust the intensity of the light of the room to individual taste is important. Being able to dim the lights in a room helps me. 5 stars. This is one of my important pieces of tech.\n12#Works! I’m using this on an old-school style pole lamp in my living room. Didn’t need or want an additional remote control so this slider style dimmer is fine and it works well with the LED dimming bulb. No complaints!\n13#good dimmer. - slide control is wide enough for Big Toe to control dimmer function - works great with my floor lamp -\n14#terrible. i have bought 5 of the and none of these work now 2 dont work at all 3 dont dim\n15#Great for heat lamps. Used this with a heat lamp for baby chickens. Was able to dial in the temp in their pen using the slider and a temp gun. Chicks were always cozy and happy at the right temp. Had no issue controlling a 200watt bulb.\n16#The best dimmer. First, I can't believe I never knew these type of dimmers existed. I can now say that I don't think I could do without them! I have two of these for our bedroom lamps on our nightstands and they are so convenient. My husband goes to bed early and I dim my lamp to where I can see when I come into the bedroom. But it's dim enough that it doesn't disturb his sleep. I bought another brand for a lamp in the family room, but believe me, the dimmer switch on this lamp slides a lot smoother. I like this one the best. I've not ever heard any humming or seen any flickering of the lights. I highly recommend this dimmer switch. I also like the fact you can operate it with your foot. 10 out of 10.\n17#Perfect for bedrooms. I hung it in the headboard.\n18#Works great. Just plugged it in and it works great! Also, I've had other dimmers emit a humming noise and this one is totally silent. Great product!\n19#Simple to use! Exactly what I wanted to dim the rope lights a little. Easiest dimmer ever!\n20#Works as advertised. Works as advertised. Price seemed fair.\n21#Works great. We have some floor lamps. Works great, Thanks\n22#Works as represented. Had a hard wired dimmer for my pole lamp that died- rewired for two prong to plug into this unit. Works as represented.\n23#Disappointed. I was led to believe that the light would shut completely off and it doesn’t\n24#Excellent dimmer! Excellent dimmer, works very smoothly. It is very stable and quiet. The unique feature allowing scaling the range of dimming is super useful. It will be my go to dimmer for LED lights!\n25#Works great To update from incandescent to LED bulb dimmer control. Nice quality dimmer switch that made it easy to convert an older lamp with incandescent dimmer on it to LED dimmer.\n26#Non flickering dimmer. Great product, does not flicker like most of the other dimmers on the market\n27#Works as advertised. Compact and well designed. Works as advertised.\n28#LED lights do not turn off. Nice dimmer...BUT...LED lights do not turn off but keep glowing.\n29#Inexpensive and compact. Inexpensive and compact\n30#No off / sent back / refund, good Seller. Dims but does not completely shut off led light. Which makes it useless Update: returned and received full refund.\n31#does not work. Took it out of the box, and it doesn't work\n32#A good option. I've had this quite a while now. It works as expected, not sure what the \"set\" feature actually does. It's lightweight and does slip around a bit on hard floors. I would have loved the cords on either side instead of two cords coming out from one side, but that's probs just me being picky.\n33#Works Perfectly! This dimmer is literally plug in and use. No issues at all and very pleased with the performance. As others have mentioned, completely turning the lamp off requires manually doing so, but where I’m using it creates no issues. I used a small Command Strip to attach the dimmer to the back of my desk for easy access.\n34#Excellent! Small, discreet, easy to operate. The floor lamp in my living room easily hooked up to this dimmer, and it's on a timer, too. I like awakening to a little light in my room, and having it go on around dusk as well. Great product!\n35#Works beautifully. Someone stepped too hard on my old light dimmer and it cracked. This one is very easy to use and just a light touch with you foot slides the mechanism to the brightness that you want. Very easy to use and install.\n36#Easy to use...perfect item. To light a lamp\n37#excellent dimmer switch. arrived presto and worked presto.\n38#not for 'christmas' lights, dimmable or not. The way you have to set this unit up is to make sure the LIGHT switch is OFF before plugging it in. Well, there is no \"off' switch on plug-in light strips like Christmas lights, so it doesn't work for squat with those. A table lamp with its own switch, maybe.\n39#Did the trick! I had an hold halogen, I changed to dimming LED bulb but the dimmer was dead. I just cut the cord, added a plug and connected it to this dimmer... et voila!! I now have a perfectly working LED and dimmable light!!\n40#Great! I can set the lighting at any brightness. I love it! Update: lasted14 months. I guess that’s OK for the money. I liked it well enough I’m going to buy another one.\n41#Had a short right out of box. It had a short in the wiring.\n42#Doesn't turn all the way off, and doesn't reach full brightness. I bought this for a set of dimmable LED string lights, and the positive things I can say about it are that 1) it doesn't make the lights flicker, and 2) it does dim the lights more smoothly than other dimmers I've tried. Unfortunately, as many other reviews have noted, it won't turn the lights completely off, no matter how far you push the slider or what you do with the \"Set\" button. In my case, the maximum brightness is also slightly lower than what I get if I plug the lights directly into the wall outlet. In retrospect, I wish I had returned this while I still had the chance.\n43#Well done. Exactly the product I expected. Represented accurately.\n44#Smelled like burning. Not recommended. Smelled like burning. Not recommended\n45#Works as advertised. Used for my torchiere LED lamp -- a good pairing. The dimmer can be operated by foot or hand. Nice to adjust for ranges from cleaning to TV viewing. There is an thoughtful adjustment to set the low range of dimming if there is flickering at the lowest levels.\n46#Didn’t work. This is a very bad quality dimer. Never worked.",
