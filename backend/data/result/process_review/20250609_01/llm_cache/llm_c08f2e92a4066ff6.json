Simple switch modernized all of our light switches.\n1#They withstand 4 kids and wipe off easily. The tactile click has authority which is a good thing for longevity of the contactors. I have four children and these switches and plates are holding up better than the previous Leviton did.\n2#Perfect for my rental. I like these a lot came in a small Box with everything. I had installed immediately perfect for my rental home.\n3#Buen precio. Es bueno la calidad\n4#Loud turning on/off. No way to really turn light on/off quietly, as they 'snap' when switched regardless of how softly you switch them. Not usually a big deal in the day, but not enjoyable at night with others nearby sleeping.\n5#They're off white. I wanted white to match sockets but these are biege not white\n6#Voltage and amp resistance. Working prefect and easy installation\n7#Single polls work. I’m not electrician just found out about single and triple poles on light switches the single ones work as advertise the triple poles do not work at all. I have to go to all the locations to try to get one to work if you have more than one switch for the same lights do not buy these if this only has one purpose, then buy them.\n8#Nice. Works Great\n9#Good deal. The work just fine. When you turn them on and off the do have a louder than normal click. Other than that they are good\n10#Toggle Toggle Toggle. Love the toggle switches. Still replacing the regular switches.\n11#Great Value for the Cost. Works as it should, and I feel this is very reasonably priced.\n12#Good. If you need just good switches this is them. Would recommend\n13#Don't wake the baby. Noisy, not quiet. I bought enough to replace every switch in the house. I should have bought only one or two, so I could make sure these are what I had in mind. After installing 3 of these switches, I noticed the switches make a \"clicking\" sound when turning on and off the light. This may or may not be a problem in the bedroom or bathroom. My older type switches were very quiet. Other than that, they were easy to install, look nice and function well.\n14#Cheapo but works. These work fine and are very easy to install. I highly question it's durability though, as they make a very hollow cheap plastic sound when flipping on and off. Won't buy again, it does not inspire confidence.\n15#Yhe quality was good. These are study and good quality switches\n16#Not exactly what I was looking for. I was replacing all of the toggle switches in my house, to these style of paddle switches. The previous switches were all quiet style. These are not quiet. They're still a good quality switch, just not exactly what I was looking for.\n17#4 of ten switches cracked after a few years. Stay away! Cheap Chinese made garbage totally tell apart on us.\n18#Poor Quality. Switches are very low quality from 12, 4 are already broken. Not a good investment for long term.\n19#Great. These are great so far\n20#Nice upgrade. Made the house feel more homey. Never had these type of switches in my life & I don't regret it.\n21#Nice!! These switches look great on my wall a standard install like any other switch. Nice, sturdy covers, sleek and modern.\n22#Replacement switches. These were replacement switches that I needed to reinstall for Alexa switches had in before. Misplaced the original ones and these installed with no problem\n23#Excelente. Muy buena calidad\n24#wrapped in plastic but all scratched up. wrapped in plastic but all scratched up\n25#They all worked. These are pretty clicky, but they all work and look pretty, the plate might be smaller than what you currently have in your house but thats the only con to this, and this doesnt apply to everyone\n26#Great. Good enough to new house.\n27#Not worth it. I've had these lights under 3 years and 3 have failed so far. The warranty is for 3 years but they don't provide a replacement only a refund. Wouldn't buy again or recommend this company.\n28#Very well made. These switches are well made, but are much more affordable than the ones you find at the local hardware stores. Very happy with them\n29#12 Pack - ELECTECK Single Pole Rocker Light Switch, 15A 120/277V. Good for the price.\n30#Feels cheap on the wall. At first I thought they were nice... Sure they looked good but I also went to Menards and got more switches of a different brand since I didn't get enough of this one... Only 10 in a pack. Over time I started noticing the flimsyness of this brand on the wall after installation. The Menards version started to outclass this crap. I wish I can replace all of them. I probably wouldn't have noticed the flimsyness when you switch on/off the lights if it wasn't for the other brands I got to fill out the rest of switches\n31#Plates were irregular sizes. The plates were irregular sizes.\n32#Loud Click. The clicking noise these make when you switch them on and off is incredibly loud. As if they purposely designed them to be annoying. I can hear every room someone enters in my upstairs house just by the sound of the loud click. Throwing them in an investment property and moving on - I would go insane if these were in my primary home.\n33#Bathrooms, hallways and kitchens where kids frequently turn & leave on. Problem solved\n34#Good quality. Good quality\n35#if you have double or more switch install or metal box the metal around unit could cause short. Great product\n36#Easy to Install. An easy item to replaced and less expensive than the Home Depot item. Very glad that I shopped Amazon for this item.\n37#Works well! Value for money\n38#Easily installed and look beautiful. Excellent and a great price look great redid my entire house\n39#NICE Plate !! best i have use, came very quickly. and great quality\n40#Product has a mechanical click when turning on and off. Easy to install\n41#Easy and nice. To my house excellent\n42#Nothing. Just wanted get a new look of my living room switches\n43#Great switch for the price. These are a delight to install, easy without any problems or issues. All the switches worked like a charm and the covers didn't crack or break when I tightened them up. There is a great audible click when they are turned on or off and the action is smooth, yet not too easily toggled.\n44#Easy Install. We purchased these and upgraded the entire house. Easy to install.\n45#Great price. Sleek design and worked as they should\n46#LIGHTSWITCHS. Perfect look much better than the old ones\n47#Worked great. Switching from old switches.",
