The dimmer doesn’t work the light reminds the same when pushed up or pulled down. Wouldn’t recommend\n1#Dimmer. They don't dim Enough.\n2#They are ok 2 out of 3 worked. One stopped working right away\n3#Great concept but failed. I appreciated the adjustment screw that allowed perfect tuning of the dimmer and each worked perfectly for a few days before abruptly failing to dim at all with the adjustment screw having no effect. Happened to both sequentially. Returned. Disappointing.\n4#Great flicker free dimmers. I've installed these dimmers in two of our houses on a variety of LED light applications from recessed lighting to lights on fans. Work great, you can adjust how low you want the dimmer to go and so far no problems with flicking which I had with most of the other dimmers I purchased on Amazon or from the box stores. Can't beat the price either and I like the hour glass shape of the switch as it distinguishes the dimmer switch from the other switches on a multi gang location.\n5#Dimmer switches control LED lights and work in an old house with only 2 wires. I live in a house built in the 1930s. Some of the electrical has been updated but many of the lights still have old wiring. It is great to find these dimmers that work with old wiring and are able to control dimmable LEDs as well. Besides the slider on the switch to control the brightness, there is also an adjuster to control the adjustment range so you can set it to work properly with your fixture and bulbs. I'm only using the single pole control but the switches can also be used as 3 way switches as well.\n6#Light switches. Easy to install, the directions are easy to follow. I haven’t had any problems with it at all. Good quality and the price is reasonable.\n7#dimmer switch enhances energy efficiency. It offers full-range dimming, allowing you to adjust the brightness to create the perfect ambiance. Easy to install and compatible with various LED bulbs, this dimmer switch enhances energy efficiency while giving you control over your lighting. If you want to elevate your space with customizable lighting, this dimmer switch is an excellent choice!\n8#Make the Switch. I'm shifting most of my light switches to dimmer switches and I like these rocker switches in particular. The dimming slide is on the side so I can set it and not have to make adjustments every time I switch the light on and off. It won't work on ceiling fans that don't have a dimming capability at all, as in it won't even control the light. I learned this the hard way.\n9#2 way or 3 way dimmer switch. These dimmer switches can be used in a 3 way or as a 2 way. I thought the dimmer switch was just ok because it wouldn't gradually dim my LED recessed lighting. It would do some and than complete off. It may be the light not able to dim correctly or the switch but I'm not sure.\n10#Adjustable. I ordered these switches to replace some 3-way dimmer switches because the lights were flickering a lot. I've noticed a small amount of flickering with these switches, but it is improved from the previous switches so I'll call that a win. I probably just need to get some better bulbs! These switches have a nice rocker movement that is easy to turn on/off. The switch slider is easy to use and everything seems durably made so should last a long time. I really like that these switches have a screw so the dimming can be adjusted for the brightness range. I have these mounted in a 3 switch box and the color of the plastic doesn't quite match the other switch or the 3 switch wall plate. The match isn't real far off, but the plastic on these looks slightly cheaper than the other switch and wall plate. I don't think it is anything you will ever notice if this switch is mounted on its own with the included wall plates, I just wasn't able to do that so thought it should be mentioned.\n11#Works great. The Dimmer Switch is a solid addition to my home lighting setup. It offers smooth, full range dimming and works well with both LED and incandescent bulbs. The on/off rocker switch is responsive. Installation was straightforward . the switch has performed reliably so far. Overall, a dependable and effective dimmer switch.\n12#Excellent switches. I got these to replace switches that were not working properly with strings (6 and 8, respectively) of recessed LCD downlights. One replaced a dimmer switch that caused the lights to flicker, the second adding dimming capability to a string that had an on/off switch. In bothe cases they were not 3-way and they worked well. I really like the slider that allows you to turn the light on to a preset light level. The paddle shape is a little unusual but not unattractive, and I was able to break off the side tab and mount the switch in a box next to a GFCI outlet, so the footprint is fine. Hard to find any fault with these switches. Highly recommended.\n13#My overall experience with these dimmer switches has been excellent. I ordered this 2-pack of dimmer switches to replace a defective one in my laundry room. Since these dimmer switches met all the specifications, I decided to try this brand, My implementation was for single-pole operation. Installation was straightforward because I was replacing an existing switch. I like that these switches do not require a neutral wire because the installation is less invasive. These dimmers operate efficiently with a gentle rocker press, and the dimmer slide works smoothly. There was no flicker when adjusting the brightness. My overall experience with these dimmer switches has been excellent. If you are in the market for dimmer switches, you owe it to yourself to consider this product.\n14#Basse qualité. Ils fonctionnent mais sont fait de plastique de très basse qualité et ça se sent au touché. Je n'en achèterais pas d'autres.\n15#Will only dim about 50%. Works and looks good, I like the large switch and small slider, but it will only dim the lights to about 50%\n16#good price and does the job. good price and does the job.. lost the 5th star because doesn't dim all the way to off.\n17#Easy to install. Works well. Easy to install. Good instructions.",
