After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Single Pole Rocker Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Single Pole Rocker Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment. Include all mentioned reasons, or \"?\" if none can be inferred. <USE_REASON> and <USE> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- <PHYSICAL>/<PERF> and <DETAIL> MUST NOT include:\n  * Generic statements without details (e.g., \"good\", \"bad quality\")\n  * Issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., \"fast shipping\", \"delivery time\")\n- If a review mentions any physical aspect, related performance, or use together, extract them as separate entries under \"phy,\" \"perf,\" and \"use,\" with no overlap.\n- Make sure each <DETAIL> is under the most relevant <PHYSICAL> or <PERF> in the context of Single Pole Rocker Switches\n- Preserve negations\n\nKey Instructions:\n- Break down reviews with multiple aspects, performances, or uses into individual entries.\n- Escape special characters with backslash that could cause JSON syntax errors.\n- Include only explicitly mentioned reasons, and use \"?\" where no reason is mentioned.\n\nFinal Checklist:\n- Go through all reviews and ensure that no aspect, performance, use, or reason is omitted, even if only mentioned once.\n- Review all entries to ensure proper separation between aspects, performances, and uses.\n\nPrint the JSON result only.\nInput format:\n<ID>#<review>\n\n[[INPUT]]\n0#The ground screw is hard to get at. They are ok but I don’t think the quality is there’s\n1#Reliable product. Good product. Work as expected. Recommend.\n2#Work well. Very easy to install and worth the money\n3#Four Stars. A very good switch.\n4#Five Stars. As expected in quality, cost and delivery.\n5#Thanks. It's a switch\n6#One Star. Product didn't work, very disappointed\n7#Five Stars. Easy to install. Looks great with bronze fixtures.\n8#Five Stars. excellent !\n9#Five Stars. Perfect for the builtin cabinet.\n10#Five Stars. Leviton Quality\n11#Very good product and good price. Heavy Duty and well made.Better price than the big box stores.\n12#Three Stars. i ordered wrong thing donated\n13#Exact match and great price. Exactly what I wanted to match my oil rubbed bronze switch plates. Much better price then in stores.\n14#High quality. easy installation and high quality. I remodeled my kitchen and replaced all the switches and outlets on the backsplash with brown. Can't go wrong with Leviton.\n15#Leviton 5601-2 15 Amp, 120/277 Volt, Decora Rocker Single-Pole AC Quiet Switch, Residential Grade, Grounding, Brown. I have worked as an electrician for my career and this Leviton 5601-2 15 Amp, 120/277 Volt, Decora Rocker Single-Pole AC Quiet Switch, Residential Grade, Grounding, Brown is as good a product as I have used. The quality of Leviton products is evident if you set them next to some of the other switches and receptacles sold. The screw connectors are secure and reliable. I have had the experience of tightening the screw on a conductor and have it break in my hand using other brands. Not Leviton! This is a 5 star product.\n16#Well Constructed, Easy to install. I just remodeled my master bath. This goes well with my oil rubbed bronze fixtures and face plates. It was better designed, when compared to my 3 year old builders grade flip switches I replaced. Very happy with the purchase and satisfied with the selection of colors available.\n17#nice color. brown is hard to find so this was nice to find, good quality, works well, would purchase this item again",
