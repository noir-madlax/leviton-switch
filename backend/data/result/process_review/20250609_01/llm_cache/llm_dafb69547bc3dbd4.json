Good quality. Worked great\n1#Fixed previous owners mistake. Used to replace a toggle switch for my garbage disposal; which made more sense, looks better and is now antimicrobial.\n2#Easy to Install. This was easy to set-up. I wanted to update one of my switches to not a dimmer. Previous owner had the fan on a dimmer, and it's just loud. This works exactly as intended. The faceplate I bought, same brand, also worked great\n3#Nice. Looks nice i never used found cheaper.ones.somewere else but they were cheap enough I'll buy again if I need them\n4#Works good. Works well and gives the house a feel of a updated look\n5#Time to step up. Sometimes the hardware stores runs out of what you're looking for but not AMAZONüëçüòâ this product works, looks great in my kitchen and my wife thinks all new homes should come with them already installed. Late night supperüí°üçúüòã never look so good üòÇüòÇ\n6#Quality. Product was very well put together and feels like good quality. It worked very well and was easy to install\n7#Good quality replacement. Good quality. Good value too.\n8#Nice switch. Needed a light switch came in quick. No dimming, worth the money.\n9#Expensive with a big flaw of not remembering the last setting. Get ready to push buttons allot. I bought them because of the brand name and did not ever want to have any issues. They are decent but the flaw is that they don't remember the last setting. So you have push the buttons ALLOT to make it go back to the dim light that you like from the last time you turned them off .......also, they don't go ALL the way down to very low light (just kind of dim?). I should of read all the reviews before putting them in the entire house. However, they are WAY better than the lights that pair individually (don't get those as there is too many units to lose connection and have to reset)\n10#Good switch. The switch does what it suppose to do.\n11#Easy way to modernize your home. Looks good and easy to install, no electrician needed. Great finish after a room gets painted.\n12#I didn‚Äôt think I could love a light switch. I can‚Äôt believe how affordable these are for how high of a quality as they are. I have swapped a lot of light switches in my years and this one takes the cake for rugged design, ease of installation, attractive finish, and reliable functionality. Now I want to stock up and swap every last one of my cheap ‚Äúbuilder‚Äôs special‚Äù toggle switches to match these.\n13#Works as expected. Works as expected\n14#Replaced all my switches to these. Theses work great for me.\n15#Good but I like the old fashion twist around the screw style. This one connects by pushing the wire in the back. I'm not very comfortable with that design but it defintely works and I will keep it.\n16#Worked. Great for replacement also easy to install\n17#Works great. Easy to install and work great.\n18#Might not be great if you light is lower than the switch. If the fixture you're turning on is below the switch, say, by six or so steps on a staircase, the signal doesn't seem to be strong enough and easily interfered with by your hand on the switch or body. I've used this before, where the light was on the ceiling, with no problem.\n19#Disappointing. This switch doesn‚Äôt work as expected. Very disappointed\n20#Excellent replacement switch. We had an automatic/motion light timer in our garage that made it super inconvenient if you were in the garage for longer than 30 seconds. This was an excellent replacement and very easy to install. It had clear instructions and is made of quality material. Overall, for the money, it‚Äôs excellent and fits perfect. No adjustment for brightness, however he color of the existing light switch matched perfect.\n21#Works perfectly. I have enjoyed having a different style outlet . Easy to flip on and off.\n22#Great price. Great price and exactly what I needed. Well packed, good quality, heavy duty for what its used for.\n23#Quality. The Dutch has a hefty and durable feeling.\n24#Made in USA switch! Replaced an old switch that shorted out after 14 years. The old one lost that assuring click when being turned on and off over time. Back in business. Very high quality for a reasonable price. And to top it off, Made in USA!\n25#Great replacement switch. My switch broke in a bathroom and I needed to replace it. This went up in moments and works great. Good price.\n26#Great brand. Good product great customer support\n27#Light switch. Great light switch\n28#Great quality. This switch looks so sleek and modern. It was easy to install. It's a good name brand that I can trust, and the quality is excellent. Just ordered another one for the room I forgot.\n29#What I needed. Good switch and easy to install.\n30#Worked great. We updated our kitchen and baths and went with white plugs and switches. These work great, easy wiring from the back without the need to bend the wires around the screws.\n31#No complaints. Bought four for a small project. One came with a missing screw but that's not a big deal. Fits well and works well.\n32#Great light switches. They look great once installed\n33#Works great! I was having some issues with my Lutron Caseta Pico switches where the lights would flicker or not go out completely. Electrician said it‚Äôs probably the bulbs. Tried new bulbs and same problems. Electrician came back and installed a in line resistor. Still same problems. Most of my other smart switches and outlets are Leviton and work flawlessly. PS I did change out the small battery in the Caseta Pico but that made no difference.\n34#Great product. Nice and quality switch, very easy to install, I really like the no ground requirement for an old house.\n35#Came damaged. Poor quality switch. It was manufactured incorrectly. The bottom piece under the bracket was broken. Originally before finding this out the wire wouldn‚Äôt stay clamped down after screwing it in. I tried looping the wire on to the screw, but couldn‚Äôt. The screws aren‚Äôt symmetrical to each other and it was too high up. The screw was touching the damaged plastic arch.\n36#Very durable. I‚Äôve use this brand for years. They are very good. I highly recommend them\n37#Good. Installed to replace the old broken one. Hopefully it will last as long as the old one came with the built house\n38#Compact Size and Fits in a Small Junction Box. This is a good quality light switch. It is compact in size and fits well in a small junction box. Easy to install. My only complaint is that the ground is on the top (in the back) of the switch and not the bottom. This makes for a tight fit if your line and load wires come into the junction box from the top. Will buy again as needed.\n39#Easy to Install Even for This Beginner‚ÄîReady to Tackle the Whole House Now! My home office makeover had me reexamining everything including the light switch. My entire house has beige units but my room needed a white one. After watching just 1 YouTube video (and buying some wire-stripping pliers), I tackled swapping out beige for white in a matter of minutes. Super easy!! Ready to swap out the rest of the ones in my home. Great value for this item especially with the added antimicrobial feature. Note, the plate cover was purchased separately.\n40#Easy to install. The lights in my mother's bathroom all stopped working at the same time. Since we knew the bulbs were good, I told her I'd replace the (38-year-old) switch and see if that fixed the problem. She held the flashlight while I swapped out the old one. We used the \"quickwire\" option since that was how the old switch was done, and the wires went in perfectly. I added a new, larger faceplate to match the switch. It looks really nice (but makes her 38-yo outlet next to it look scruffy, haha). All told, we were in and out of there in under 10 minutes, including the trips to the basement to flip the circiut breaker. And when we were done, the lights worked, yay.\n41#Flimsy and breaks easily. I'm surprised at all the very positive reviews. This should be a simple quality item that lasts for years. In my case, I bought 3, and one of them broke immediately upon installation. The switch internals stopped working. No click, no switching, and the rocker became loose and unattached. I had to go out and buy a replacement locally, and I find that Lutron and Legrand both seem to be better quality than Leviton.\n42#Simple to install. Purchased this to replace a broken light switch. I had never done this before, watched 1 youtube video and within just under 5 minutes it was replaced. I have had no issues since it has been installed and requires little to no cleaning. I would recommend this product to others.\n43#Great Product. Easy Installation\n44#Works as expected. Works like it should exactly as I needed\n45#Easy hook up. The switch works perfectly and looks good.\n46#Wall switch Works & Looks Great. Replaced an old broken timer wall switch with this simple on off switch. It‚Äôs for a back light that really doesn‚Äôt require a timer. Works perfectly and looks good on my living room wall.\n47#Wall light switch. Like because it's different from what I had",
