If you need a 10v dimmer for Zwave home automation this is what you want. If you do not know what a 10v dimmer is then you do not need this. The unit is small and easily fits in a single-gang box with a standard toggle switch. When paring, I was pressing the pair button too slow so if it won't pair then speed up the cadence of the triple press.\n1#As expected. Kinda shocked it worked\n2#Works as advertised. Unit does provide precise 0-10V control.\n3#Great for control of wall packs. I’m using several LED wall packs for exterior lighting around my home. Each has a Zen54 to control it. The Zen54 has a relay that cuts power to the device when turning it off. Note that this is for 0-10V dimming, which uses a pair of sites wires to send an analog signal to a fixture to tell it how bright to be. The 0-10V signal does not drive the light source. 0-10V fixtures have FIVE wires: line, neutral, ground, Dim+, and Dim-.\n4#Does not install like a standard dimmer switch ! Buyer beware !! This is a frequently returned item !! This device does not install like a standard dimmer switch. I purchased this device thinking that it would install like a standard dimmer switch, however in order for it to function as a dimmer you have to connect the purple dimmer wire in addition to the red “load” wire. It DOES NOT wire up like a standard dimmer in which you simply connect the positive negative and neutral wires.\n5#Worked great with 0-10V LEDs. Used this in tandem with a Zooz momentary switch and professionally hard-wired LED strip lights using 0-10V dimming for epic garage lighting. Has worked flawlessly after I fixed some issues with my z-wave and home assistant setup unrelated to this device.\n6#Works perfectly! I was able to use these to control some high bay UFO lights through HomeAssistant. My lights are 1-10v dimming which had me concerned at first but these devices have a built in relay to be able to turn them off completely. Pairing was easy and I also installed some Zooz momentary switches to have physical control over them outside of HomeAssistant.",
