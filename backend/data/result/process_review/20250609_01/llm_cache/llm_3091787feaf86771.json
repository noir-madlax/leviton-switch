Great value\n1#Good switches. God switches for a good price\n2#Check wiring, not for all. Worked on a couple of different outlets, but not all, beware\n3#Best price for the quality. Good quality hardware. I did an electrical remodel of a kitchen, den and living room and used these switches for my single contact circuits. These single contact switcher are very good quality. They work well and the hardware is like the hardware from HOMEDEPOT or other switches.\n4#direct replacement. I have now changed over all of our indoor light switches to these rocker type. They make a click noise when turned on or off, whether you think that is detriment or not.\n5#Some didn’t work. Didn’t like that some of the switches in the box were defective.\n6#Does what a switch do. I knocked a star off just because the sound and feel of the switch leave something to be desired. Slightly too loud and \"tinny\" sounding.\n7#You get what your pay for it. Fall in pieces after few months\n8#Face plate breaks off on all 10 switches, cheap and all 10 will fail in 3 months. You will replace everyone of these light switches due to the cheap materials used. Manufacture will not warranty.\n9#nice but not the best quality. I have rentals and I've had 4 of them fail inside 3 years\n10#so far all good. A pack of rocker switches, what's not to like. They work as advertised\n11#Failed within 2 years. We changed out all the light switches in the house when we did a remodel. Two years in, and we already replaced over half of these switches because they all broke or starting to break, like the gap between the plate and the switch itself was getting wide and unsafe. Some just flat out broke. We're not hard on things, just two adults living here. Save your money and time in the long run and buy a better brand, or brand name ones.\n12#Serious Quality and Safety Concerns. Incredibly LOW QUALITY! These light switches are disappointing. After installation, we had electrical issues and found 2 out of 6 were defective. We had to pay an electrician to replace them with better ones. I'm returning the product and concerned about its safety and quality control. Amazon should reconsider selling these switches.\n13#Easy install. Easy to install better than what was there\n14#Great switch. Operation feels robust\n15#Just what I needed and saved a lot of GREEN $$. I wanted to replace my OLD outdated low voltage mmentary Contact touchplate light switches which are very expensive with something more modern without breaking the bank. I easily converted these to momentary contact switches using springs purchased here on Amazon and I LOVE THEM. So easy to convert and instead of paying $39.00 for each new switch I spent around $2.25 for each switch after purchasing the needed springs to make them Momentary Contact. Now Multiply that by 3 TIMES (30 Switches) and I saved close over $1000\n16#The rock is not as quiet as I would have preferred, but they do work. The only thing that is disappointing in the rockers is that you have to switch them around in order to get them to work in the off and on position you reverse it in order to get it to work\n17#Buenos. Muy buenos y buen precio\n18#It is a light switch, and it turned on and off. I did not have to leave the house to get it. It works like it’s supposed to.\n19#Works great. I installed the entire package and had no problems at all.\n20#Quality not so good. Having tried a couple of them for a year, have to say the quality seems iffy. One of the switches already popped out and had to be replaced. The switches seem like collected from various sources and put in a box. I say that because the earth connection is at different place for many switches. Still the switches work fine when installed, just don’t expect them to last like the original switches.\n21#So refreshing to update my switches! These were such a breath of fresh air. My old switches were yellowed and dingy. So gross looking and not fresh. This was easy for me to install (I have some experience). The quality seems great and so does the value.\n22#Just what I wanted. Just what I wanted for replacing our toggle switches to more modern looking paddle/rocker switches.\n23#Value Pack. Good product and quick delivery.\n24#Great product. It really classes up my house.\n25#Functions and looks just like a more expensive switch. Was easy to install, looks good, white color matched another switch from Leviton, switch tap is quiet, screws are strong and held the wires well in place. Would buy again.\n26#No trademark. Product does not have the registered trademark (R) as would be if it were authentic UL listed.\n27#Doesn't Last / Waste of Time & Money. This is a viable switch. Design and functionality is great out of the box. I purchased/installed these in March of 2023, and now on Nov 6th, I've had three switches break. This 3rd one broke today in the same way as the others; the paddle starts to shift and slide to an angle and then eventually pops out completely. I've replied a dozen times, but it will last 2-3 switches and will happen all over again. These 10 switches and the time to install are now a complete waste.\n28#Color matches the plate. I am glad that the color of this switch matches this brand’s wall plate. But it is noisier than the Leviton switch from Home Depot.\n29#Product seems fine, packaging is a disaster. Based on initial inspection, the product seems fine. The packaging came busted open. I am amazed they all stayed in the package.\n30#These are solid switches. Pretty cool product especially for the price. My wife and I have bought and sold homes multiple times over 26 years. I like to work on the electrical and like to save a little money too. These switches are as good as an 8 to 10 dollar switch at the box store.\n31#Easy to break. I've had about 5 of these (out of 30) break off from simple day-to-day use. They are cheaply made, and I'm replacing them each time they break with Leviton switches (made in USA).\n32#It would be 5 if it was soft touch! It’s easy to install and we got it right! The only thing it is the “click” when turning on or off! But it’s just a minor thing\n33#One bad one. Purchased a pack of 10 to replace around the house. Half way through replacing, 1 out of 10 doesn't work. I'm not going to sit here and troubleshoot as I am too far into replacing them all. Will update on the others as time passes.\n34#Good value. Excellent replacement for our old outdated switches\n35#Good quality, but a few didn't work correctly. Out of the 20 of these that I installed in my house, two were faulty. One didn't have the ground on it, and the other stopped working about a month later and I had to replace it. The others work great, I would purchase again.\n36#Junk. Almost all that I have replaced have cracks. These are cheaply made garbage Maybe if you don't have a full house or kids these would be fine .. or if you never actually used the switch. But they wear out from being turned on and off and the button will pop out.\n37#Works just like major brand name. Easy to install. Great price.\n38#Consistently fail within six months. I purchased a number of these switches and have had to replace all where regular use is needed with Leviton decora. These are made very poorly and the paddle pops out within a few months. In the picture is the second set of switches I installed from this purchase of 10. Avoid and just get name brand.\n39#Product is okay. Easy installation. As long as you are putting screws in by hand. Overall performance is not very good. How ever great price . Screws tend to strip out when using a cordless screw gun into a plastic box\n40#Poor qualitt. Trying to screw straigh in plate covers is extremely difficult if not perfectly\n41#Low build quality. Latest 2 years with regular use. Low build quality, keep them in very light areas.\n42#Very Nice Switch. I purchased these Enerlites switches as a more economical option to what I had purchased at Home Depot. I cannot comment on the durability, but the quality seems very high and they were easy to install with either screw attachments or wite push in holes. Seems like a good product!\n43#Great Value for the Package. I needed several of these switches so I bought this package. Although it was more than I needed, it was cheaper than buying them individually. They work great and look good. Now I have extras. Would recommend without hesitation.\n44#Works well. Should have a mixture of single pole and three ways.\n45#Not white. Not white, more off white or slightly almond",
