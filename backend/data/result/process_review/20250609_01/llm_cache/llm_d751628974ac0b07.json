I, am an idiot. I thought multi-location meant... Separate rooms. These are intended to work together and the companion switch does not work independently. Entirely my fault. My lack of knowledge cost me big time on this one. Thought I was saving by buying a twin pack, one for each of two rooms I wanted them in. But, this was not what I thought it was. So, the ONE that I CAN use, is now the \"expensive model\". Insert multiple face palms here. Only gave 4 stars because, I feel that the description could have been clear enough for folks like me to understand all this.\n2#Three Way, Multi location Switch/Dimmer. Lutron consistently meets high standards. Worry-free quality.\n3#The best. These are the best. So many functions and you can program it in so many ways. Better to watch YT video how to program it. We love these. We Replaced like half of switches in the house with these. Expensive but worth it\n4#Unless you need the snap on cover plate, buy them separately. The dimmers work great but you can save some money by buying these separately if you don’t need the snap on cover plate.\n5#Lutron is good manufacturer. No need now\n6#Good switch, though expensive. To start, I bought this switch set because it is the only one of its kind I could find. Options are non-existent. Installation was straightforward as a 3-way switch. It's no different, except to say that the live wire must be on the primary switch. That out of the way, the switch itself is neat. The rocker switch part is not a rocker switch, it's a simple pressure switch. There's no up for on, down for off. Touch it anywhere and it turns on and off. The dimmer switch controls the dimness (of course) and the two switches do sync with each other. All-in-all it's a good switch. It is expensive, probably because there is no competition. Someone else needs to make one.\n7#Fixed my light kitchen switches. I use these in my kitchen with four-way lighting. They were super easy to install. I did buy one other non-master switch and my kitchen lighting dims beautifully.\n8#You probably don't need this 2 pack and the labeling is confusing. Was looking for a LED compatible dimmer for existing location. Saw this 2-pack and thought, great...I'll get 2 switches and have one as a spare. WRONG. Only one of these is the actual switch. The other is a \"remote\" switch that cannot work on its own. Not only that, they look nearly identical and endless you know to look for the -R product number you could end up debugging a switch that isn't meant to be used as a switch. Lutron's own help pages just assume you know this. The install manual assumes you know this. None of this is obvious. I hate Lutron's install manuals. They don't even show proper wiring diagrams half the time. Yuck.\n9#Usenlo. Es un buen producto , lo recomiendo\n10#Excellent dimmer switch kit. I wanted to replace my two-way light switches with dimmer switches. This dimmer switch kit included everything I needed. The instructions were very easy to follow and included detailed pictures and diagrams. The switches are consistent with the excellent quality you would expect from Lutron. The price was very reasonable, making this a great value.\n11#Works! But did NOT take 15 minutes. Read review for troubleshooting! So first off, watch the video online to install because the paper instructions did not specify how to wire three way correctly, only the video. We had existing three-way regular flip switches. But each light had the red and black wire reversed from each other. In the instructions, it tells you to basically wire them up the exact same as we found it. And the pictures look like everything is opposite from each other. We did everything it said, and it didn't work. Then we went and looked on the video online, and it said to make sure that whatever is attached to the blue screw is exact same on both the master and companion switch. Recommended red. Which one of ours was on red and one of ours was on Black from the start. So once we did that it started to work, but our companion switch would not work, only the master. It would dim on/off when the button was held down and if you let go of the switch, it would go back to whatever state the master switch had it in immediately, After scouring the Internet, we found advice that finally worked! Unfortunately, the website troubleshooting did not have this answer so I'm here to share it with you. If this happens the master control is programmed to work with a mechanical switch. Go to to the master control and hold the tap switch, and up on the dimming rocker at the same time until an LED starts to blink, then release. If the bottom LED is blinking, tap the up button on the dimming rocker once so the blinking led is in the middle. Once the middle LED is blinking, tap the tap switch once to get out of programming mode. This worked for us, and had we not found it on a forum we would not have been able to use these switches and would've returned them. I think the company should update their troubleshooting guide to reflect this issue as it seemed to be really common. The only other thing I wish was that it would remember the setting that you had it on last and it would turn on to the setting you had it on last but I guess that's not a huge deal since we have it set for a kitchen light. We have the switches paired to compatible LED wafer lights. The brand is Mico and the model is 5cct in 1 slim panel Led recessed downlights. In their manual, they mentioned that this Luton was a compatible dimmer switch and highly recommended. We didn't want to risk buying cheap switches that wouldn't last long so we went with the high recommendation spent the extra money.\n12#More Lutron Quality Issues. We did our last house with Lutron Dimmers. 18 dimmers, about 1/2 were faulty, all were replaced with simpler Leviton dimmers which worked fine. Now we find ourselves in the same situation. Another rennovation, chose Lutron for looks, so far we've replaced 2 switches, I have another 2 to replace today (with simpler Leviton dimmers) and I believe there's another 2 that are acting weird. Problem: They have a delay when lighting, anywhere from a couple of seconds to 5 or 6 seconds. Frequently they never trigger the light, very occasionally, they work. Off works fine. At the first house, a different Lutron electronic dimmer had about a 50% failure rate. We were told, by Lutron, a bad manufacturing batch. However, the dimmer had a short market life and was discontinued before we purchased ours. A large inventory of junk was left in retail channels. We unknowingly bought the junk. But HD did refund our money. Now we have at least 25% failure rate and nowhere to go but worse. The first 2 replacements were covered by the wholesale electric supply house our electrician uses. My converting over to Leviton is not covered. My advice: Buy from a retail channel with a good return policy, insist your electrician do the same. Test quickly and thoroughly. Insist he gets them working before you pay. Do not take \"its the LED light\" as an excuse/reason. That's pure and simple BS, pull the switch, touch the wires, viola, the LED light works fine. These are pretty but they are also poor quality.\n13#Great Product! Easy Install!! Wonderful product with great directions for single and three way wiring. This switch delivered for me, I’d definitely recommend it.\n14#Did you know…. These dimmers can be used in a 4 way configuration up to 9 locations !? Yes it tells you right there in the directions that this is possible and how to wire it, but honestly in all my years it never came up and no one asked until just recently. So I googled 4 way dimmer and sure enough it’s switches I’ve long been familiar with but just never knew. Like finding out your best bud is actually Superman lol. Anyways. Works perfect. Customer was thrilled. Now they have a dimmer by the door and one on either side of the bed to control the lights in the bedroom. Very cool. Wish I had known sooner.\n15#very reliable switch. I installed these in my kitchen, and they worked flawlessly every time. Nice smooth dimming of lights and soft touch.\n16#Follow Instructions! Not complicated at all. I have 4 Pendant Lights with 2 switches (one on each side). Taped the wires, as per instructions, connected and used wire nuts as indicated. Works beautifully. No buzzing or issues. Be sure you get Master, and Companion dimmers for similar install. And, be sure you have dimmable bulbs. Mine are LED.\n17#Practical switches that may not feel as premium as their other switches. I recently installed these Lutron dimmer switches, and I'm quite pleased with the results overall. The standout feature for me was the easy-to-follow diagram that supports 4-way circuits and made the installation process a breeze even for a beginner like myself. For reference, I bought the companion dimmer switch along with this in order to have the switch at a 3rd location. That being said, while the dimmer switches themselves function well, they are snappy to turn on the lights and dim. However I couldn't help but notice that they feel a bit cheap and squishy to the touch. Given their importance in daily use, a more substantial and tactile feel would have been preferable. Despite this minor setback, their performance at this price point in adjusting the lighting to create the perfect ambiance for different situations gets the job done. If you're willing to overlook the somewhat flimsy feel in favor of their excellent functionality and ease of installation, these Lutron dimmer switches are a practical addition to any home lighting setup.\n18#Lutron, always reliable. The Maestro dimmer system is great for lighting. The dual pack includes the main control (with lights) and a companion dimmer (no lights). for a 3-way installation. Easy to wire with back push in ports. Side screw terminals are also available. If replacing plain on/off 3 way switches be sure to note the wiring and traveler wires. These are great in many different rooms of your home. Dimming saves energy and also adds more interest to a room. it is an easy DIY project. For intermittent use in a home. I have had these for several years without any problems. Works well with LED lights and older incandescent bulbs. Not meant for tubular fluorescent bulbs. I have never had any issue with the Meastro switches, installing or function. You have to properly identify the traveler wire to get it to work properly, if you don't you will have issues. Also use the breakaway metal tabs if using the dimmer in a box with other switches so it does not touch the other ones.\n19#horrible design, totally impractical. These switches are tough to turn on and off because the switch button is difficult to press in just the right way to get it to toggle the lights. The brightness changes on its own if you accidentally bump anything while you're trying to turn it on and off. Will be returning them or throwing them away but they're not staying in my house. Horrible design\n20#Great dimmers. I’m an electrician and these are not only a good price but also great dimmers.\n21#Good Replacement for Older Dimmers. Replaced an older incandescent Lutron dimmer. Installation was very easy - except for me losing plate screws. Now the LED's turn off when they are supposed to!\n22#Good. I need to return the other one not working but was credited\n23#Control from anywhere! Amazing relatively inexpensive solution to be able to control the dimming function on a series of lights from virtually anywhere. With the purchase of additional secondary switches, you have the ability to dim from 10 locations, if the wiring is in place or if you are doing a new build. This set of switches easily allows you to take a three-way switch and dim it from both switch locations as opposed to only the one like usual.\n24#Way too expensive & not simple or versatile. These are for rich people, normal folks should not purchase. You cannot pair the Maestro with a normal 3-way switch, accepting the simplistic reality of only dimming on one side... you must use these in combination with the \"Companion\" switch if you want to use in a 3-way configuration. Just WAY too expensive.\n25#Great dimmer, chintzy buttons. After trying and failing to install two different wifi three way dimmers I decided to eliminate the \"smart\" aspect and install a three way dimmer. This was one of the few that offered the ability to dim the light from both switches, which is a necessity for me. Installation was easy if you already know how to wire a switch, and it worked as expected. I'd give it five stars if the main button to turn the lights on and off wasn't so chintzy. It feels like thin plastic and there's almost no resistance when you push it, so if you're walking by and hit it you often have to stop and push it again. This is the same on both switches. More often than not, we now slap the button with authority rather than tapping the button, which I'm sure will reduce the lifespan of the switches.\n26#Complicated install, but work great. The installation was a little time consuming and difficult, but just follow the instructions carefully and you will get through it. Or better yet, hire an electrician to install them. After install, they work great. Have been using them for several months now and have had zero problems. Using them with a fixture that has LED dimmable bulbs and the control is smooth and even. Color of switch matches adjacent traditional switches perfectly. Very satisfied.\n27#Great functionality but design could be better. Both switches where easy to install and work great. The default settings work perfectly with my LED recessed lights and I love the way it ramps down when turning off. I also love that you can control the dimmer from either switch. That said, the size and design makes it difficult to fit multiple dimmers/smart-switches side-by-side in a 2 or 3 gang box. Also, I’d prefer a more traditional paddle switch function (up for on, down for off). Instead of a single button for both on/off.\n28#Super Dimmer Switches. Used these in our latest remodel project. They work great and were very easy to install and having a dimmer at any location needed is great!\n29#Finally something SMART. A huge improvement to light control, assurable 3 way control and nice fade out at turn-off. Well worth the investment to control multiple LED bulb brands. Easy to fit in multigang boxes. Really makes the room \"tech-like\". The small control light array isn't intrusive for dark rooms. WORKS.\n30#Worked perfectly. Four stars for \"Easy to install\" because they require more than elementary familiarity with wiring techniques. I recommend not doing this yourself if you have yet to learn how three-way switches work and how to insert a switch into an existing box. Otherwise, this pair of switches is not difficult to install in a three-way circuit. They do a perfect job when hooked up. The instructions on setting the dimming level are impossible to understand.\n31#Love the dimmers. The delayed shut off is a nice feature.\n32#Works with New Recesses LED Lighting. Recently remodeled a stairway and added a few new LED lights and also replaced 2 existing with the new fixtures. The 3-way dimmers work smoothly to dim all 4 fixtures with no flickering as I’ve experienced with some other dimmer brands. I’ve used Lurton dimmers for many years and they just work and work for a long time. I have dimmers from this brand beyond 20 years. Highly recommend.\n33#Works as advertised. Very expensive but does what it is supposed to do.\n34#works great. easy to install, works great\n35#Great deal!! Same as big HD store, saved money for the same thing!!\n36#Disconnect frequently. These are great. However they disconnect from our network frequently\n37#Easy to install, works great with LEDs. I replaced existing 20-year old 3-way switches with this set and installed dimmable LED to boot. East install, comes with faceplates or you can use standard ones. Works great with six Sunco Lighting SCBR4017W27K BR40 bulbs. I have the fan + light version of this in four rooms, this is my first 3-way.\n38#Like the product! Switch works well with LED lights and install was straight forward.\n39#Remedy a led light flicker. A little pricey. Solved the flickering and Esthetically pleasing please\n40#Quality. Just what I need for my new lamp.\n41#Great but sensitive. Great product, installed with \"ease\" The reason I put with ease is because I did not know these were essentially low key tech slammed in a switch. I connected everything up... Threw the power to the room... Tested the switches... And was over the MOON. Since they worked, I started shoving stuff into the wall and the main switch itself POPPED! Lights turned off and the switch smelled like burning electric. Turns out these guys do like being played with, fluctuations in power Will kill them, so i highly reccomend killing power when doing anytning with these... And deffinitly use the power kill tabs to even do something like a light bulb change\n42#Ease of installation! I love the easy installation and the performance. I will definitely purchase these again and much more affordable.\n43#Good pieces. Great for lighting we needed\n44#Works with common Sylvania recessed LEDs from box stores. Instructions were easy to follow for multilocation. If you don't have a voltmeter or are unsure how to find the hot wire, consider have an electrician wire them. They take about 10 minutes per switch. Luetron has a list of compatible LEDs on their site. Not all bulbs work with all switches. I bought these common Sylvania LEDs at either lowes or HD and although they don't list them on Lustron's compatibility list, these switches do control them quite well! No flickering or \"always on dim\" smooth gradients between lighting levels. I am happy.\n45#Some lights randomly turn off. The dimmer itself I really like. It dims our lights really well, better than I expected based upon other light setups I've had in the past. My issue is this: I have 6 LED lights, and one of them (not the same one) will randomly turn off. Its really annoying, especially when we have people over. You can see in the pic that one of the lights is off. Its like this at least 50% of the time now, if not more. Installed it less than 6 months ago, so definitely not happy with purchase. Will have to get a different one I guess\n46#Great product. I really like this product. Takes some getting use to, but once you stop old habits you grow to love it\n47#Lutron equals quality. Good product, easy installation. Dims well LED spotlights.\n48#Kinda odd to work with. Being that they are a two way dimmer - one is the master and the other referred to as the \"slave\" dimmer. Had an electrician put it in and he found it to be very different and kinda hard to install. They work weird as you have to push on, push again, slide up down and push again. Its just a lot of steps. Does it work and dim well? Yes. But he told me I paid too much for it.\n49#More expensive than smart dimmer. I just realized that kasa smart dimmer switch is cheaper than this one. Sad.",
