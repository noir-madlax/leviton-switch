After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the WiFi Connected Smart Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The WiFi Connected Smart Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s.

I wanted to like this but the setup required me to used pigtail wires from previous light, and I tried so many times to get Alexa to connect to it, unsuccessfully. The design was the only thing I ended up liking about this, and it was replaced by another brand after a couple weeks.\n1#Save your money. The app will not find my device and instrcutions are in Chinese. So can't use with Alexa, which means it's not a \"smart\" switch.\n2#Great product. Been using for 8 months with no issues.\n3#Check your home's wiring FIRST! I assumed my home's wiring was from this century; sadly, it is not. This switch requires a neutral wire, of which my home has naught.\n4#Did not connect to router. I'm a big fan of Sonoff but unfortunately I had to return this switch. I had trouble connecting to router so I went with Kasa tp link\n5#No ground wire. Couldn’t wire since it had no place to connect the ground wire. Also wiring confusing as it has input and output for live wire.\n6#Love it works good and is cool looking. Love it all around\n7#Excelente producto, llevo varios años y siguen funcionando perfectamente. Fácil de instalar y de configurar, es muy estético, buenos acabados, se necesita polo a tierra.\n8#IFTTT Requires Subscription. I purchased one of these before replacing a few more wall switches, mainly to test it out. It's one of the few black smart switches out there and looked pretty nice along with some solid reviews. However I purchased this with the intention to automate it along with the rest of my place via IFTTT applets. Much to my chagrin, when I attempted to connect the device to IFTTT, I was greeted with a screen from eWeLink letting me know I needed to pay an annual subscription in order to use anything other than their app. I have quite a few IOT devices and NONE of them require a subscription to connect to IFTTT. Returning as soon as possible.\n9#Don’t waste your miney. Worked for about a week, after that the sensor started to go. Don’t waste your money it looks cool and upgraded but it’s not\n10#Beautiful design Privacy nightmare. Really loved the look of this product it is very sleek and elegant! However, it requires an app on your phone which is a complete privacy invasion of your device. Ideally they would allow for alexa/google integration and then allow you to delete their app after configuration of the device. To name a few, these are the permissions you must enable so that your LIGHTSWITCH can funtion: -full microphone access with recording at any time -full camera access with recording at any time -full bluetooth access -real time geolocation -data stored in China For some I suspect this isnt too big a concern but was too much for me to feel good about. I encourage you before buying to download the eWeLink App and read the privacy policy. If these were corrected I would gladly buy the device again.\n11#It never works... It never work for me. I follow the instructions to install it in mi room but the center blue light never lit. Bought it few weeks ago...\n12#cumple con lo que buscaba. cumple con lo que buscaba, pero no doy 5 estrellas porque cuando activo el interruptor manualmente, hay veces que toca hacer varias veces para que encienda o apague la luz. pero si lo recomiendo, es bueno tenerlo.\n13#Clean and stylish! Easy install and great look, ordered another for additional light control\n14#Bom é lindo. Adoro os meus 7 na minha casa\n15#Funciona perfeitamente. Uso o produto integrado c Alexia. Funciona perfeitamente. Além de ser bonito\n16#Entrega. Valor muito bom, mais o prazo de entrega muito demorado\n17#Entrega antes do prazo e produto em perfeitas condições. Excelente qualidade do material, fácil instalação e configuração e design fantástico",
