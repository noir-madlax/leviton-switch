After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Single Pole Toggle Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Single Pole Toggle Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment. Include all mentioned reasons, or \"?\" if none can be inferred. <USE_REASON> and <USE> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- <PHYSICAL>/<PERF> and <DETAIL> MUST NOT include:\n  * Generic statements without details (e.g., \"good\", \"bad quality\")\n  * Issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., \"fast shipping\", \"delivery time\")\n- If a review mentions any physical aspect, related performance, or use together, extract them as separate entries under \"phy,\" \"perf,\" and \"use,\" with no overlap.\n- Make sure each <DETAIL> is under the most relevant <PHYSICAL> or <PERF> in the context of Single Pole Toggle Switches\n- Preserve negations\n\nKey Instructions:\n- Break down reviews with multiple aspects, performances, or uses into individual entries.\n- Escape special characters with backslash that could cause JSON syntax errors.\n- Include only explicitly mentioned reasons, and use \"?\" where no reason is mentioned.\n\nFinal Checklist:\n- Go through all reviews and ensure that no aspect, performance, use, or reason is omitted, even if only mentioned once.\n- Review all entries to ensure proper separation between aspects, performances, and uses.\n\nPrint the JSON result only.\nInput format:\n<ID>#<review>\n\n[[INPUT]]\n0#Very good quality. Great quality replacing all tge cheap ones from Lowes\n1#Made in Mexico Not USA. Worked as it should, great screw install instead of back push ins. Other that made in Mexico, I have no complaints.\n2#Useful. These are a little cheaply made but work great got me\n3#heavy-duty, tight, positive action. We needed a few heavy-duty switches for use where our behaviorally challenged son uses them. He has broken many paddle-type switches and plates. This design forces him to use a finger to flip the switch rather than slap the wall, hard. they have nice, tight action, and the box is noticeably more stout than the usual contractor special.\n4#Good Shop Switch. Good feeling throw when you flip on and off.\n5#leviton 54521-2w 20 amp single-pole switch . i used it on a 15 amp circuit , the switch looked very sturdy . the switch was very quiet (when operated), worked well for what I was using it for.no problems so far. no problems using 14 awg wire on it.\n6#Did not have back wiring as stated in the description. Back wiring not available on the switch I received.\n7#Perfect. It also works well in areas where 220V is used. It is easy and convenient to install.\n8#Great product super value for it’s price. I use it to replace a magnetic contact switch which prove to be much much more durable plus the operation is a lot more easier and smoother.\n9#Not 'back wired', terminal screws barely long enough for two 12 gauge wires. Wish I had paid more attention - these have terminal screws instead of the back-wiring clamps, and getting two 12-gauge wires properly under the terminal screws was difficult. For the price these should have the back-wiring clamps.\n10#Good quality. Installation was easy and the switches have a nice look for a residential application.\n11#Excellent Product. Easy to install. It arrived in excellent condition\n12#Would buy it again.. Easy to install..\n13#Good product. Good product\n14#Turns stuff on and off. It operates as one would expect and looks of good quality.\n15#Dead on arrival. One of the two I got was broken, took me a while to figure out it wasn't the wiring.",
