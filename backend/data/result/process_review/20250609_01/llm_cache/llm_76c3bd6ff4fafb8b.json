Not a 20 amp light switch! This is not a heavy duty switch. Could potentially cause fires because it is misadvertised! Product part number is actually rated for 15 amps. This is NOT a joke!\n1#Worked & fit perfectly. Worked & fit perfectly.\n2#Great switches. It is a Leviton switch so the quality is there and it functions well\n3#Small Job. Needed two of these to wire a pair of outdoor fans. These are very nice switches and I have covered them with watertight outdoor switch covers that should protect them for the elements. Been in service for one year with out troule\n4#Great Price, Works Perfectly, Easy to Install. Product was easy to install, and now my lights don't flicker any more.\n5#Light switches. Works great easy to install look great\n6#This is not quiet. I specifically want a switch that is quiet and doesn't click. This is not it\n7#As advertised. Top quality. Heavy duty. As advertised. Top quality. Heavy duty. Needed for the kitchen circuits. Replaced all of the outlets in my house along with screw-less cover plates to modernize the look inside. Used all white and took out the old cream color ones.\n8#As listed. works as advertised\n9#Grounding screws aren’t locked in. As soon as you undo a screw the backing fumbles around, garbage design, go with something else and save the headache.\n10#Quality! As advertised\n11#Work Fine. Bought this switch to replace some in my house. Leviton is a good brand and I usually don’t have my issues with their products.\n12#As advertised. On time and works as advertised\n13#NOT back mount. The terminals are NOT back mount. Which is why I bought this expensive outlet. Won't buy any more.\n14#For some reason it doesn't click. More of a soft bump feeling. It says it's \"leviton\" but either it's fake or there are serious quality control issues at leviton suddenly. The switch is junk. It has a gross sort of soft clump sound and feel when you activate the switch. It's totally unlike all the other decora rocker switches I've ever seen. They all have the same consistent click sound and feel and you don't realize how consistent all the rocker switches are in the world until you activate this one and hear the little wet cardboard thud it makes. It does technically work as a switch though, I checked.\n15#Nice product. The look and few great. So far so good.\n16#Very useful and great for safety. This is great because it matches almost all decor switches and the momentary contact ensure that the disposal runs only as long as you hold the switch.\n17#Leviton switch failed to perform!!! One of the product’s screws needed to connect the electrical wire was not screwed into the threading and could not be tightened. Very disappointed that my electrician needed to return with his own switch to complete the work. I ended up not saving money.\n18#Switch is no longer smooth. Bought these before the change. Unfortunately now they emboss their name on the switch which harbors bacteria and viruses. Switches need to be perfectly smooth for cleaning and prevent germs from accumulating. I will not be buying any Leviton products until they fix this. Really bad timing Leviton in making the decision to promote your brand.\n19#Easy peasy. Its a light switch. What can you say about a light switch LOL It works and was super easy to install. Recommend.\n20#This is the true quiet switch. I tried the Leviton 5601 which is promoted as a quiet switch, and yet the click on that model is MUCH too loud for my liking! Take a listen to the video posted for that item by Stuart Schwartz on 6/30/20 to have a listen. But, THIS 5621 is the true quiet switch if that's important to you. It has a very nice solid feel. This model handles 20 amps, vs 15 amps on the 5601, but that is not a problem if your true needs are a 15 amp switch. This just means this switch can handle more amperage than the other model. It will work fine for 15 amp circuits. You are paying more for this extra amperage handling ability (beefier insides). It's up to you whether having a true quiet switch is worth the extra money.\n21#The mechanism leaves a lot to be desired but they work. The switches are okay... they work, they look good... but they just don't FEEL good. Given the cost I would hope for a smoother easier switching mechanism. It's not going to stop me putting them everywhere in my house... I need to get it done! No time for shopping for the perfect switch.\n22#good price. great unit have 5\n23#2W Paddle Switch. The HD switch installed easily and seems to be working properly.\n24#Feels solid. This switch has a solid feel to it and installed without trouble\n25#Great Switch, Quiet Operation. This is an excellent switch. It does its job well and the switch itself is quite silent when turning on or off. Leviton has a good reputation and I have high hopes this switch will live up to it.\n26#good. what I expected\n27#Careful with side screws. In general, this is a nice commercial-grade switch with back and side wiring. As others have noted, don't back out the side screws too far, or they can become disconnected from the internal nut and there is no way to fix this. They should arrive backed out as far as they should go, don't loosen. I did receive one unit where the screw was disengaged from the nut out of the box; had to send it back to Amazon as defective. Otherwise, 5 stars.\n28#Five Stars. Nice product.\n29#Good product. Bought two of these for our bathrooms and had no issues installing. I also like the way (slider) the dimmer works.\n30#Handled the amperage the previous switch couldn't. I had a switch that was getting warm because too many amps were flowing through it. This switch handled the current without getting warm. I then decided to get the source of the high amperage checked and found out it needed to be replaced. Turns out I needed new equipment and not this switch, but I will use it elsewhere in the house because I have some switches that need replacing. This switch operates smoothly and functions perfectly. Some of the switches in my house require an extra little pressure for the click after initially pressing them. Not this one. Just press it on or off and it moves smoothly and works perfectly. I will see how it works over time.\n31#Five Stars. As described.\n32#Works with my in ceiling heater for the shower. Works with my in ceiling heater for the shower. It required a 20 amp switch which this product is.\n33#Good Heavy Duty Switch. Good, heavy-duty switch for a large, in-sink garbage disposal, at a good price.\n34#Nice QUIET switch - very happy! Very nice quiet operation and looks!\n35#Matches smart switch. Simple switch to match smart switch next to it\n36#Great. Great product at a great price\n37#quick delivery. Nice quality.\n38#Excellent Switch! Typical Leviton Quality: Well made and looks great!\n39#Five Stars. Works well and looks good\n40#Works. Needed a 20 amp switch for the garbage disposal but could not find any local that matched the other switches.\n41#A great switch! Perfect as a simple switch! Smooth and easy - decora is a nice upgrade over standard switches. Installation is a snap.\n42#Great product. Great product and price especially for a 20 amp switch.\n43#Le prix. Allumer la lumière au dessus de l'évier j'aime\n44#Solid Construction. This is a well constructed rocker assembly with simple yet positive wire connections to the screw/plates I have had overheating issues with the push pin connectors.",
