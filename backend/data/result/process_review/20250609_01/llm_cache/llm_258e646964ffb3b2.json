Big lag between switching on and lighting up. Although both lights and bulbs are dimmable, the switch creates flicker. Would not buy again.\n1#Viene daÃ±ado. Uno viene daÃ±ado y no mucho me gusto que ya trae los cable conectados\n2#Works great. Easy to hook up and it works great.\n3#50/50. One of the switches worked fine, but the other was broken. After installation, the switch would short and turn off if you brushed it gently. Can't find a way to get in contact with the seller for a replacement.\n4#Lights flicker and turn on with a delay. It Causes the light to flicker and lights turn on with delay.\n5#Junk. Things are nice looking, feel cheap. They work decent but after a few months of use, they are causing the lights and fans to flicker. Each switch is on 1 single ceiling fan. One is flickering so fast it looks like a strobe light, the other flickers every 20-30 seconds. Have checked with other switches and the problem does not continue. Donâ€™t waste your time or money on these unless you donâ€™t mind swapping them out after 6 months.\n6#Disappointed: Significant delay in switching and dimming operation. Unfortunately, there is a significant and annoying delay in switching and dimming operations with these dimmers. Switching on takes nearly a full second for the light to respond. True also with dimming. It also feels like toxic metals are present in this product. Returned for a full refund.\n7#Price is good but didn't last 3 months. Install was easy. But like most people say there was a second or so delay when turning lights on.. installed this switch in October. However by mid January switch will not operate and may come on only a split second. It's only operating one LED light overhead in my kitchen so it's definitely not overloaded. Price was good but seems not made well. I'll install other one and see how long before it dies.\n8#Worked well with our leds. It was a good match for our led under cabinet lighting. Good price.\n9#Donâ€™t last! I have had for not even 3 months one has no issues and the other flickers! Would not recommend!\n10#Works very well for my can lights. Install was very simple with included wire nuts and stripped leads. The instructions were straightforward, and I really liked that there was an adjustment for the brightness slide.\n11#These are great - work with dimmable LED bulbs. I've replace almost all of the light switches in my house with these and they all work great. All with dimmable LED bulbs.\n12#Adjustment switch. Only use for two months then one was broken. Quality no good.\n13#Works, but feels cheap. This product works fine, and easy to install, but feels very cheap---like it won't hold up to normal use. The rocker switch feels weak--like it will break at any second. Also, there is a small, but very noticeable delay when you turn it on until the lights actually come on. Very annoying. Not sure if I'll return on not. Going to live with it for a few weeks and see.\n14#delay and missing screws. The delay when turning on this unit is far too long. Makes one thing it is not working, press again and it does not come on because the switch thinks it is being turned off. The units I received also had only one faceplate screws - not the 2 that are needed\n15#Works great! Easy to install and works great. Good product for the money.\n16#Poor craftsmanship on this item. Bought this product in July, only lasted not even one month before it stopped working. Had to replace today. Not good ðŸ˜¡\n17#Makes the lights flicker. I bought these to replace old dimmer switches because we replaced the bulbs with LED lights. The old dimmer switches made the lights flicker, so we got these replacements because they were specifically described for this situation. The lights still flicker. I ended up replacing the switch with a standard, non-dimmable switch and it works just fine now. Garbage.\n18#2 pack - CLOUDY BAY LED Digital Dimmer Switch for LED Light/CFL/Incandescent, May 22, 2024 - On April 10, 2024, I bought the 2 pack for $19.99. It arrived on time, well packed, and I installed them right away .. Installation was very easy and straight forward. I installed one in a bedroom and one in the guest bathroom.. As some reviews stated, there is a delay on both switches. I did order different light bulbs thinking that maybe I did not have the right bulbs, but no, still same issue, but still, I could live with the delay, no big deal for me. The one in the bedroom still working (for now) delay and all, but over the weekend I discovered that the one in the guest bathroom (that is not used often) is no longer working. I turned the power off, removed the screws and made sure everything was connected ok (it was), but I re-connected the wires and still it did not work. So, I removed the dimmer switch, and installed the old one I previously had. The light is working ok now, but sadly I can't have the dimming capabilities with the old switch. I am guessing I got a defective device that now I can't return because my window to return is over and I do not even have the box it came in. Very upsetting to get $20 down the drain.. I guess it is a hit and miss with these switches, even thou there are many 5 stars, I do not recommend it at all, the old dimmer I have in my dining room still working and that thing is over 25 years old..!\n19#Starting to flicker after 1 week of install. Unstablly flickering the lights from the installation will ditch thesw out.\n20#Delay turning on and work sometimes. During installation, I test it by touching the wires, it didn't come on. Apparently it's delay by nearly 2 sec from clicking the switch until it turn on. Did not come on instantly. Kind of thought it was bad at first. And it work half the time, it work the first few pushes. After that it work maybe once out of 5 times turning off / on. Returned it.\n21#buen precio , recibido a tiempo y en excelente condiciones de empaque. Excelente producto y entragado a tiempo , los recomiendo\n22#Works great. Works great\n23#Inexpensive dimmer. Does the job but had some issues removing the flickering even after playing with the dial. Might upgrade to something more expensive.\n24#too fragile donâ€™t buy. Feels economy and my son snapped the spring in the on off. It just is not good for a switch in my home. My son can be a little tougher on switches but it broke fast. We went through 2 in less than a month.\n25#You get what you pay for. These are garbage. We bought them knowing the reviews said there was a delay, but figured it canâ€™t be that bad. We had them on the wall for 6 months, and yea, theyâ€™re that bad. Itâ€™s a several second delay from the time you flip the switch until the light comes on. They also flicker when the light is on a low dim, not sure if thatâ€™s the switch, or the bulb, but Iâ€™m betting on the switch. Currently at this moment, the husband is putting the regular original switches back on the wall, and these are going in the trash.\n26#Worked for a few months, then started strobing, DOES NOT WORK FOR LEDs. NOT RELIABLE FOR LEDS. This worked well enough for a few months in a very infrequently used guest room. It definitely has the delay and slow ramp up to turning on the lights that all the other reviewers mentioned. It was passable though. This week all of a sudden, the lights started strobing HARD. Really cannot leave them on for more then a few minutes before you start to feel like you're getting dizzy and on an acid trip. Note: Unfortunately, the full effect doesn't come across in the video because of the shutter speed.\n27#Does what itâ€™s supposed to do and looks great. No complaints. Iâ€™m happy with this product\n28#Great price. Looks good and easy to install. My only issue is that there is a delay for the light to come on when you switch it on. Also the dimmer button is super small and sometimes hard to move to the right spot\n29#Flickering light on multiple fixtures. I bought two for two light fixtures and both fixtures are expiring flickering light when dimmed. The intensity keeps changing on its own, very frustrating now I have to change them again The actual switches have a clean sleek look\n30#Value for the money. Iâ€™m building a wine cellar under my stairs. The dimmer works fine. As other reviews state it lags turning on. I have an expensive dimmer that ramps up and fades out - nice but expensive. I like the wheel adjustment to set to your light fixture. I made all the way down very dim not off.\n31#Could be better. Device is slow to respond to controller.\n32#2 second delay. Easy to install. Quality of plastic is a somewhat delicate not as sturdy as I will like. The delay when turning on bothers me ( about 2 seconds). Not sure if I will return product or not.\n33#Delay to Turn On. Using LED bulbs. Not Smart bulbs. I bought 2. Each is on a single circuit. They each have about a 2 second delay before they turn on. Dimming works fine. It is the delay in turning on that is not good. They are in a hallway, so it is tolerable and not worth the effort to unwire, return, and then rewire with a better brand. No, I would not buy these again.\n34#It's Cheaper for a reason. I am not very impressed with these dimmers for a few reasons and a few failures -Issues with how they are suppose to work - These dimmer are digital and have quite a delay when turning on, the dimming is chunky as well. This is normal operation for these dimmers. -Other Issues- I had one dimmer with a loose wire. as you moved the wire around on the dimmer side it would go full bright or barely on, no in between. I also got a nice little shock tightening the screw. The dimmer downstairs has started dimming a few seconds after turning on but brightens to full when slightly dimmed. Long story short I wish I went with something else.\n35#Long delay before light output. Great price for a dimmer switch but these switches cause a long delay before the bulbs turn on. After flipping the switch thereâ€™s about a 2 second delay before any light is turned on. Takes a little getting use to\n36#Has a 2 second delay. You turn on the light switch and the light doesnâ€™t turn on for a full 2 seconds. You might think itâ€™s not working and flip it again because it has such a long delay I connected it to LED spotlight It does dim well\n37#Works great. Great for updating the lights with leds\n38#Not working, cheap and bad. The dimmer is not working properly\n39#All you need is in the box. Works as expected, the good part is that all parts needed to replace an existing switch are in the box. All you need is a small screw driver. Decent quality, clear instructions.\n40#Pleasantly Surprised. I bought these to replace my failed dimmer that was less than a year old based on price and rapid availability. They compacted the switch body which made it far easier to stuff back into the crowded switch box. Also, the dimming function is smoother and less choppy than the failed switch, and the switch itself is engineered so it won't fail in the same manner as the last one. If they last a decent amount of time I'll be even happier...\n41#Good low budget dimmer. Great price on a low budget dimmer. Works well. Lacks a quality look. Satisfied. -AJ\n42#Easy install. Easy install. Way cheaper than any box store.\n43#A great dimmer with one annoying issue. This is an excellent dimmer. I like this type of dimmer design which features a standard size, easy to operate on/off switch in addition a small, narrow dimmer slider - since most of the time I want to turn the light on to a set level. I installed 3 of these in my home and they all work very well. PROS: - I appreciate the short depth (it's less than an inch behind the mounting plate) since my dual-gang switch box has quite a few wires passing thorough it. - Works great on LED-only and LED+incandescent setups. - The small dial for setting the minimum dim level is easily accessible and works well. CONS - The only thing I don't like is that it takes over 1 second to turn the lights on after you hit the switch. I understand that it's better for the bulbs when the voltage level ramps up rather than instantly jumping to 110VAC, but 1+ second is excessive and annoying.",
