Bought an older house that had black and wooden light switches, changed them out and the fit was perfect and easy to do. Easy for a quick upgrade. Seems durable.\n1#Works Great! Easy I stall, works great.\n2#Product is not the same as the image description. These are quality switches for sure. However, the image clearly shows a clean switch toggle face. But what arrived clearly has a \"Levinton\" logo stamped on the bottom left corner. I bought these because they seemed to be clean... Booo. It seems small, but the details mater in some cases.\n3#the screw heads are very soft and strip. The rocker switch is fine. However if your junction boxes are small and you force the wiring back into the box the screws would strip when you tried to screw in the switch. Fortunately I saved the old screws from the prior switch that worked just fine. They need to increase the quality of the screws.\n4#Don't buy they fail after 18 months. I bought 15-20 of these smart switches. After 1 1/2 years, they began to fail with respect of the manual switch. They still work through Alexa. I'm now looking at replacing all of these switches. It's not a great price if they fail after 18 months. However, it appears, the switches I manually press frequently have not failed but the ones I rarely press have all failed.\n5#Open Boxed Product Package Immediately - I RECEIVED USED PRODUCT. Product received was as described except it had been previously opened and (2) of the (10) switches had been previously installed and were damaged. Mounting screws were missing on (2) of the (10). One of the two had a scratch across the face. The other had damage to the ground strap on the mount where the screw makes contact for grounding the box. Unfortunately, I had not opened the box until I was ready to install the switches, only to discover the above and the return window had closed. Not happy at all with Amazon on this purchase. The undamaged product works just fine. Would by the product again, likely not from Amazon. Although they switches are listed as residential grade, they are actually marked Specification Grade and are rated for 120-277Vac.\n6#Excelente. Buena calidad\n7#Packaging sucked all came in crashed box some had scratches. The seller was not smart enough to pack them in box it was in plastic USPS bag. Product was fine but packaging sucked some had scratches. Hope the seller do better job not to ship in plastic bag.\n8#Excelente. Good product\n9#They Work. Nothing much to say, they work.\n10#Not the cheapest, but work. Always reliable products from Leviton. Beware cheaper switches. They are poorly made and just feel cheap. These always work well.\n11#These definitely aren't silent. These are a good medium between cheaper switches and the expensive Lutron switches. They aren't as quiet as the original stick switches, though. Leviton shouldn't advertise them as such, so they lost one star. Luckily, I didn't buy them for this feature.\n12#Not as shown. The switch has Leviton in raised letters on the front of the switch. I don‚Äôt know who thought that was a good idea. Guess I‚Äôm switching to Eaton. Seller should fix their add and their design.\n13#Leviton is it - Been around for years - flips on and off flawlessly. Pro's: -Leviton quality, which is a no brainer -Leviton has been around forever, trust relentless craftsman qualities -Clicks both ways with ease Con's: Zero Hero! Synopsis: Great light switches, been around for years. CAUTION: DO NOT BACKWIRE/BACKSTAB(OLD SCHOOL). Curl the wire and wrap from left to right around the screw post. Screw on tight! This is the old school electrician speaking. Don't be a D-bag! Thanks for reading, switch away! You're lights workey now!\n14#Functional and Decorative, but not \"Quiet\". Leviton is a trusted brand, however these rocker switches are far from being \"Quiet\" as advetised. Needed something to bring the existing toggle switches into the 21st century, however these switches just make a resounding 'clunk' when switching positions. Returned.\n15#Very good product, but thought it would be quieter. Switch is quieter than regular wall switch, but not as quiet as some others I‚Äôve installed. Gave it 4 stars for value because one of the switches had overtightened screw which ruined the item and rendered it useless. All in all I would recommend it at this pricepoint.\n16#Not completely quiet. Definitive click when using. Otherwise, perfect.\n17#Embossed branding ü§¢ and off white, came scuffed. I went for this one because the image looked like an older box, and I was hoping to avoid the new embossed ‚ÄúLEVITON‚Äù branding. You‚Äôll love these switches if you are dead skin cells or perhaps some bacteria, otherwise I don‚Äôt know why anyone would want these. This was my biggest issue. To make matters worse, it was a slightly off white to some of my older Leviton plates. Also several had scuffs that I could maybe wipe off if I wasn‚Äôt returning them. They probably function fine.\n18#EASY INSTALL. GREAT PRICE AND (MADE IN THE USA) SUPRISED NOT IN ADVERTISING REPLACEING MADE IN CHINA JUNK!!!\n19#Good generic light switch. I'm replacing some old light switches and these are good quality at a good price. I've used Leviton for years and always been happy with their products.\n20#Easy to install and works well. Installed in the bathroom as a replacement switch and this works just as well as anything you buy at the hardware store. I will buy again if I need any more switches.\n21#Good only for light duty applications. These are fine for most lighting. Not strong enough for motors or appliances.\n22#Great quality, but they have LEVITON logo on switch. The switch paddle has the LEVITON logo sticking out (not embossed) on the face of the switch paddle. Personally, I think that will cause the switch to collect dirt over time as people touch it to turn lights on/off.\n23#Discolored and beat up. The switches showed up, finally. They were \"white\" but had been in direct sunlight and had yellowed. Since they were late I had to install them but I am pretty upset that they look like garbage next to the others. I would stay away from these guys until they get rid of these discolored switches.\n24#You get what you pay for. Great product .\n25#Works well with D26HD. Asymmetric 3 way switches are tricky if you are unsure of existing wiring to determine where smart versus companion switch must be located. Would love to see some instructions on how to best determine that. Otherwise these switches work and look as expected.\n26#Not product pictured. Not product picture. Waste of time.\n27#Nice light switch update. This leviton light switch is a nice update to my old switch. There is a little click noise and the switch toggle is nice. The company name is on the bottom left of the switch, but that doesn't bother me.\n28#Plastic parts break after a year. We replaced all the switches in the house, about 30. After a year, 2 are inoperative, 5 have broken plastic parts, and 1 was bad out of the box. Also, there is a little gap in the top that drives me a little nutty. Use at your own risk.\n29#Not exactly as pictured. These switches now have the brand name ‚ÄúLeviton‚Äù embossed on them at the bottom corner. Kind of lame.\n30#I received what was asked for. I use this all the time should be fine\n31#Very good. Recommend for everyone\n32#Logo on the switch ruins it. Great switches, but I'm returning and not installing in my home because Leviton insists on molding its logo onto the face of the switch itself. I don't need your logo flashed all over my home. And the way the logo is molded into the plastic, it catches dust and grime and makes the switch dirty. STOP PUTTING YOU LOGO ON IT, PLEASE.\n33#Kinda dirty and scratched. Not sure what to think of this box, clearly it‚Äôs left over from some else‚Äôs project so I guess reduce re use and recycle?! Should have advertised as so.\n34#Parts corroded and old stock from a suspicious source. The switches arrived loose in a cardboard box with no markings. The metal parts of the switches were corroded and the plating was failing. The switches were certainly around a long time and I question if they are in fact Leviton and not a third world knock-off. Price is the same as your local big box store but covid caused me to buy on line. The instruction card was soiled and crumpled certainly not something Leviton would send out.\n35#Leviton logo. Why is the \"Leviton\" logo on the rocker switches?\n36#Embossed logo. These switches now have Leviton logo embossed on them that aren't shown in the pictures nor in the product description. If I had known about them beforehand, I probably would have gotten other ones. Other than that it seems to work fine.\n37#Beware! These must low quality knock offs! Junk! I have used 4 (all in the same spot) and all 4 are defective. Too late to send back now. the switch itself has to be slowly pushed on and off in order to get the light to actually come on. Very disappointed! The name Leviton used to mean quality. I will now be throwing these away as I fear they my cause a fire!\n38#Very Poor Quality - Broken within a year. Looked fine initially. We have had these switches installed for less than a year.. Many have broken.. The plastic cracks and/or the switch pops out of the wall.. Do yourself a favor and buy something else.\n39#Not even a year... I usually review my amazon purchases at least a year later to give a good account on the performance of a purchased product but today's review is being done on a highly rated item that has not lasted for a year after installation. They looked great right after installation. Fast-forward a few months and they are now cracking and falling apart on the wall! I have posted pictures to show not all of them are deteriorating, but a majority of those purchased and installed earlier this year are already falling apart and presenting an electrical hazard to anyone brave enough to use them. I will be replacing them all soon with another product that is durable and not filled with fake reviews to pump up their purchases.\n40#Good. Easy to install, but maybe not quiet enough\n41#Very satisfied. Good quality\n42#Great switch but has Leviton written on face. I love Leviton decora switches. I started switching out all of the old style toggle switches in my house. Very easy to install and very quiet. Not completely quiet but doesn‚Äôt have that loud pop/click that competitor switches have. I ran out of my first 10-pack box and when I got another one the word ‚ÄúLeviton‚Äù was written in raised letters at the bottom of the switch. Searched high and low for switches without the name and thought these were ‚Äúnameless‚Äù but I was wrong. These have the brand name written on the face as well, so I returned them. Don‚Äôt give up, there are ‚Äúclean‚Äù face Leviton switches out there on Amazon.\n43#Better than Lowes cheap crap. Easy install and great quality built\n44#Great. Works great, no complaints\n45#Not a true quiet switch. The Leviton 5621, is MUCH more quiet. (Comparison 5601 vs 5621). I tested out several switches in stores, because the clicking sound when turning most switches on and off was much too loud for my liking. This 5601, in particular was disappointing, since it is promoted as a quiet switch. It's not, at least to my ear! The video posted in the review here by Stuart Schwartz on 6/30/20 really shows this. What if you are like me and know that every time you flip this switch you will regret buying it due to the loud clicking noise? There is a solution, the Leviton 5621. This switch is as close to quiet as you can imagine! It is more expensive since it is made to handle up to 20 amps of power, vs 15 amps with this model. A 20 amp switch will work fine in a 15 amp circuit. You are just paying for a more beefy switch than you need. Not a problem. In addition, the 5621 does NOT have the company name \"Leviton\" in raised letters on the switch. Many recent 5061 reviews mention this undesirable feature. So, while the 5621 is significantly more expensive, at least you have the option if you desire a near quiet switch without the company name in raised letters on the switch.\n46#Why are these called \"Quiet switch\". I don't understand why they bothered to add \"quiet switch\" to the title, these certainly are not. The click it makes is actually kinda annoying and probably wouldn't have even bothered me if quiet wasn't in the title. I had specific expectations of a silent experience turning on and off all the switches in my home but the only thing these things are quieter than is perhaps yelling at Alexa to turn on the light for me.\n47#Leviton logo lettering on switch. It appears as of June 2020, Leviton made a change to the product and added raised \"LEVITON\" lettering on the bottom left corner of the switch face, this is not reflected on the product listing on Amazon. In my experience, dirt and grime will build up around the raised lettering and it's difficult to clean. I bought these specifically for the clean looking surface, I will be returning these and look elsewhere.\n48#not quiet switches as described. These are not quiet switches as its written in the description. If i had known they wouldn't be the quiet switches as described, then I would have saved 25% and purchased them at the big box stores.",
