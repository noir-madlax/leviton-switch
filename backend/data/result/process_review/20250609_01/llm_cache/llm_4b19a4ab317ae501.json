Good fit, quality, functional design. Recommend.\n1#A+. Ok Switch , was missing the top box screw . Other wise they look like a great quality product. Highly recommend.\n2#Basic switch that works well. Bought to replace toggles switches in my house. Works well and have zero regrets.\n3#Easy to install. I replaced all the light switches in my house with these, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier! They‚Äôre reasonably priced, easy to install, and work perfectly. A great upgrade for a modern look without breaking the bank.\n4#Easy to install. These light switches were simple to install and work really well. They‚Äôre much easier to clean and look nicer than the older, traditional switches we used to have. They make a slight click when pressed but nothing that has bothered anyone.\n5#Beautiful Smooth Finish. Easy to install. Quality switch. Bought more after installing my first one. Great replacement switches for my 25+ year old switches that were looking faded\n6#well made switch. this is a well made switch.\n7#Great value quality part. These switches work great! Quality part and easy to install.\n8#Good 3 way switch. Love Leviton products. Good quality switch from Leviton. Attractive too.\n9#Perfect. Was what I expected\n10#Good 3-way switch. Replacing some old switches, and used a number of these on the 3-way circuits.\n11#Works Great, Just Be Sure to Review the Wiring Diagram on the Package. Does exactly what a 3-way switch should do. Just be sure to review the wiring diagram on the inside of the package. The load post was in a different location than I was used to, so it would be easy to wire it incorrectly.\n12#Seller. Leviton is good company and good product. However, seller not so good. This is the last purchase from this seller. See pictures.\n13#programmable. outside lights for security\n14#Leviton rocker light switch. Excellent switch. Function, fit, quality and ease of installation are enough reasons to go with Leviton. Same for their 3 Way dimmer. Both installed in 15 minutes\n15#Leviton makes a great product. This switch from Leviton is easy to install and looks great. Leviton makes some of the best electrical components around.\n16#replacement. they don't last forever, especially in high frequency use (bathrooms)\n17#Grey switches labelled White!! These switches are GREY, not WHITE!!\n18#East to install. Replaced a broken switch. Instructions were easy to follow.\n19#Brand Stamped. I took a chance seeing some images appeared to not have the branding on it. It DOES have the name stamped on.\n20#Turn the lights on. The switches turn the lights on and off. Seem to work great.\n21#Satisfied. Good product\n22#Fit and Form as expected. Easy replacement and looks better than the replaced rocker switch\n23#It works! Yup, it turns lights on and off :-)\n24#Great line of products. Top shelf product\n25#Great product. Changed out all the switches in my house and love them\n26#Only received 1 of 4. Only received 1 of 4\n27#Less cowbell, more decora. Leviton has quickly become my go to for switches and outlets. Their quality, color, durability and performance places them atop the competition. These switches are awesome! Nice satisfying click, larger surface area and great neutral white color. I find the decora style give a nice modern touch. They are also easier to configure into 2 gang and 3 gang applications. The decora wall plate gives option for light switches, outlets, pass through bristles and fan switches. No more counting wall plates and ending up with a pile of extras. You get just one style of wall plate for your whole project! This is a great option, especially for people adding smart switches to their home.\n28#Works as it should. Works as it should.\n29#Save yourself some time and order them here. Needed to replace the light switches in my apartment. The Orange store is accross town and they cost more there. These are the same as the ones sold there, only less money, and I didn't have to drive across town to get them. So far there are no issues, the swithes are quiet, and work well.\n30#Good quality. Fast and good quality\n31#Works. As described\n32#Good product ! It works as it should ! Overnight deliveryüëç and price is great üëå\n33#Interrupteur. Bien, mais pas beaucoup de qualit√©\n34#Antimicrobial? I bought this because every hardware store in my town was sold out. I spent many years at an electrical contracting business and know Leviton is quality and you pay more for it. (But in ten years it will still work) Anyway, this switch is exactly as advertised. But antimicrobial? It is plastic.\n35#Great buy. Easy to install. Price could be lower\n36#Fonctionne bien. Facile d‚Äôinstallation. Il faut s‚Äôy conna√Ætre en √©lectricit√© et avoir un fil a 3 voies d‚Äôinstaller. La seule chose qui ‚Äúm‚Äô√©nerve‚Äù c‚Äôest qu‚Äôil y a une des 2 switchs que lorsque la lumi√®re est allum√©e, la prise principale est a ‚Äúoff‚Äù (par en bas). Je suis certaine que cela s‚Äôarrange facilement, mais je n‚Äôai pas pris le temps de regarder et de faire le changement!\n37#Switch has Leviton Branding on the Face. There is raised lettering on the face of the switch that is not shown in any of the product pictures.\n38#Leviton -- quality item. Its leviton. Assume the quality is there. it is.\n39#Work well and well built. Little on the pricey side but they work really well, I had to replace two older 3 Way switches and after a couple of months with no issues I decided to go ahead and change a few more in the house. These are pretty good quality and built to last from what I can tell so far. Totally worth it.\n40#Different topology. I replaced my old 3-way switches with these Decora style switches. However the three screws to tie down the power wires are in a different layout then the old switch, and my wires were not coded to let me know which wire was the hot, and which was the traveler to the other switch, so I had to guess. It took two tries to get it right. Fortunately, as my electrician brother told me later, there was no danger of blowing myself up... the switches would either work, half work, or not work at all depending on where the wires were attached.\n41#Tr√®s dispendieux sur votre site.
