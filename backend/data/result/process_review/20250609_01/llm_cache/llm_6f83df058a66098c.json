Very easy to install. This is a great value for the money. Looks very attractive in the home with the lights, illuminating that night. It's like little nightlights all over your home. The switch quality and build quality.It is very nice. They fit very well and look very attractive in the home.\n1#Good Idea and Product. I like the product and the idea, but I wish you could order them with the light on the bottom. Although you can turn them upside down to get the light to shine down, the switch is still upside down which is just a minor annoyance.\n2#Everyone needs these! Great switch with bonus night light. No issues, should have purchased these sooner.\n3#LOVE THESE LIGHTED LIGHT SWITCHES. High-quality switches easily install to provide a modicum of light from an LED when off and entering a dark room. Positive click on & off. I bought a bunch of these to put throughout the house!\n4#Light. Love these , have them in multiple locations , just enough light\n5#Maybe or Maybe Not. The switch broke after 2 years.\n6#Nice little light. The lights are very nice but i guess I expected the light to be a little brighter than it is. That being said, I would buy it again if I needed another one.\n7#A must have minor upgrade! These are super cool! They don’t give off so much light you can’t sleep at night but there is no hassle finding the light switch at night. Replaced all our paddle switches with these!\n8#Nice night light, one of two flickers. The switch will light upwards when the light is off. It works very well as a night light but I sort of wish the light was faced downwards. I cannot allow myself to install the switch upside-down. I would give this item 5 stars but one of the switches flashes twice a second so two stars.\n9#Great for dark rooms. These are great good when walking in the dark and you can’t see anything. Plus they keep the room well lit at night.\n10#It's a good but not great product. If the light switch stays on 90% of the time, the LED night light lasts a very long time. If the switch is used frequently, the LED night light lasts only a few months.\n11#Not a good purchase, ended up returning. Ended up returning this, installing it was a nightmare. Needed like 3 wires and ground and if I remember correctly, didn't have instructions.\n12#Works great. Works great\n13#Clicks do matter. These lasted almost 4 years. The switch started to fail recently when I flipped it to the \"On\" position. The spring mechanism failed to hold it in the on position. I have another one that's starting to fail the same way. This switch is in my bath area, it probably gets used a dozen times a day. I expected this switch to last longer. Moving on to a Leviton.\n14#poor quality no night light. Night lights don't light\n15#No Switch Cover Included. While the switches look and work great they didn't include the switch covers as pictured in the product description.\n16#Incompleto. Al revisar el paquete se observa que llega incompleto ya que falta la tapa solo llegaron los interruptores.. y en las fotos de la publicación se ven con la tapa\n17#Does NOT Illuminate Brightly as shown. The pictures shown with the night light 'on' remind me of the technique you use to lighten photos you take with your cell phone. The light does NOT illuminate the space above in a wide angle; at best it is simply a switch locator light. I'm replacing it with the original Leviton paddle switch that has a built in LED as the switch locator (when the switch was off, the fuller upper portion of the switch was lit with the soft glow from LEDs). The switch is also cheaply made, your only choice is to screw in the electrical wires, instead of just pushing them in, and I don't want to take a chance with such a cheaply made product.\n18#WARNING - FIRE DANGER. The vendor we bought this same product from is no longer available. However, this is the same product, just a different quantity. This is a very dangerous product—somebody better listen! I installed these switches, and it never even occurred to me to look for the European approval mark or the Underwriters Listed or Unlisted label. There are no approvals for this device of any kind, which means it has never been tested, or if it was tested, it did not receive any approvals for installation or use in the USA, Canada, or the EU. All four of the switches we received are leaking voltage. This means that even when the switch is off, there will be power at the light or fan. If the switch is used to turn a fan on or off, the fan is always powered on. However, it cannot pull enough current to rotate. Throughout the night, the motor will continuously increase in temperature and may burst into flames in the middle of the night while you're asleep! Ours did not burst into flames, but we could definitely feel the heat radiating from a still fan. I'm not just a home DIY guy; I did my 10,080 hours to become a journeyman electrician, so please keep this message in the context it’s meant to be delivered. The attached picture is of another bedroom with a different fan and light using the same switches. The fan motor has a different switch leg than the light circuit. The picture shows the light are on. Please note that the lights switch is off.\n19#Easy to install. Looks great. Works as advertised\n20#Perfect. Do not think the light on the switch is a night light. It is not. It is a light for you to see when you are trying to locate the switch in the dark. Works perfectly and expected.\n21#Lights going out. After a month of using the switch two of the four light bulbs inside the switch have stopped working, I can't imagine the last two will last much longer.\n22#read 4 stars. this is an wonderful item.. very brite, only downfall is room is not to brite in the day time it will not turn off as it will in a bright sun lite room\n23#Low light use to find switch not a good night light. Not bright, shows light upright not down to the floor. Would not buy again. Better lights out there.\n24#Really nice lit switch but could be better. These are overall really nice switches because of the unique LED’s up top. These actually provide subtle lighting for a small room which looks nice without being distracting if you want total darkness and also provides some visibility in complete darkness. The cons are- the switch itself sounds a little cheap when flipping. Best described it sounds empty inside as compared to a regular home depot rocker switch which feels more “full”. Not a huge deal but something to note. Second one of the two I got the LED’s have a very subtle flicker to them. Not enough for me to have to return it or for it to be noticeable unless you stare at it up close. Fit is perfect for switch panels I bought from different brands, and they are very inexpensive. Would buy again but would also be happy to pay a little more for a “fuller” more robust sounding and feeling switch actuation. Overall would still buy again. It’s great in my bathroom as it provides enough light to see what you’re doing during a mid night bathroom visit without having to turn on the light and blind yourself/wake yourself more with bright lights\n25#1 Failed in closed position would not shut off current to light. Review for: SOZULAMP 2 Pack Illuminated Light Switch, Decora Paddle Rocker Light Switch with LED Night Light, Automatic On/Off Sensor, Single Pole, 15Amp 120/277Volt, White - $17.88 One of the switches failed soon after installation. Had it professionally installed in the day, flipped it on and off several times to test, went to bed overnight, got up 8 hours later, happened to notice that the light this switch was installed on seemed to be, on! It had broken sometime during the night in the on (closed) position - Huh? The switch was in the 'off' position (open) but somehow closed on its own which let the current through & turned the light on. The switch wouldn't shut off the current no matter which position the paddle was in - the power to the light could not be shut off via the switch had to unscrew the bulb which was burning hot so the light had been on for some time. How it all went: First off I got two of these switches had only wanted one but they're sold in pairs. Installed one of them in a dark hallway to add a bit of light and to locate the switch, worked great. Been flipping it off/on in normal operation. Had no planned use for the second switch so figured an extra for a rainy day. The one switch worked well and looked quite modern. A few days later figured that hallway could use a bit more light and decided to have the second of the pair installed. Both worked just fine then & was really impressed with the look and the amount of light in the once dark hallway. Then - the above occurred. Failed overnight in the permanently 'on' position. One is still working and one crapped out hours after install. I would regard this is a serious design issue and am glad it only operated a single light and not a more hefty such as a fan. Was only a 19watt bulb and not a 100w, 200w or greater. Throughout my lifetime I have never had any switch fail in any position off or on. Pros: Modern look & sleek design White switch color went well with decor & cover plate Tiny lights help to locate switch Indifferent: Did not find UL mark Too sensitive slight dimness can activate night light No way to shut off nightlight like some others Cons: Clicking sound is a bit louder than some others At least one was not as solidly built as initially thought - so far Can only partially recommend\n26#easy installation. very original design, worked perfect\n27#Great lighting. It’s much better than the Snappower offerings. Just be aware that the switch actuation is noisy. Probably not a good choice for a child’s bedroom. Mine was used in a garage so no problem.\n28#Exactly what I wanted. This product gives you enough light To wear if you go in the dark, you can find the light switch and the glow is enough to wear. You don’t have to turn the light on. I used it in my closet and my laundry room.\n29#works as advertised. great product\n30#Failed early. Worked great at first, but quickly needed wiggling to get power to the internal lights, then failed altogether by the 6-month mark. Great idea but needs to be built more robustly -- this wasn't abused.\n31#If you want light to be directed at the floor, you have to wire in with off being up! The product pictures show that you can mount the switch so that the light is pointing upwards or downwards. Just be aware that if you want to use this as a nightlight, the switch will turn off when the top is pressed. That's counter to standard operations.\n32#Fine for finding lightswitch but Not a nightlight! Think the page info is a bit misleading, These are nice, well built but only function as a guide for the light switch itself and not an actual nightlight.\n33#Upgrade. Perfect night light my hallway\n34#Perfect night light. Easy to install. The perfect amount of light at night.\n35#Works good. Works good nightlight not bright but good light\n36#The light is not very bright. The product is ok , but the light is not as bright as you may think\n37#Flickers. The lights randomly flicker on both switches… I have verified the wiring is making good connection, I will be removing them in fear of a safety hazard by the flickering causing some kind of short.\n38#Lasted less than a year. Purchased the 2pk in Feb 2023, it's now April 2024. They both worked great at first, I had a professional electrician install them. One of them stopped working in September '23 so it only lasted a few months but the other is still working properly.\n39#Had a defective switch. This switch is what I wanted but one of the two switches would not toggle properly. I never did install and returned it. You get what you pay for.\n40#Purchased two years ago. Purchased a two pack for our guest bathroom 12/2020. Replaced the first switch with the second in the pack 3 months ago. The second switch has stopped working as well. Something in the switch wears out and has difficulty connecting when you turn the light on. Cool at first, but overall junk.\n41#Works. Added these to our bathroom, not extremely bright but it’s something.\n42#Perfect bathroom light. Great for those of us that have to get up several times a night to pee but don’t want to turn the lights all the way on.\n43#See the Light. Great switch. Great switch with motion and night sensor to find switch. It’s an easy install and works great.\n44#Lighted wall switch. This product is great. It emits enough light to help navigate darkened areas in your home.\n45#Perfect for Bath, too bright for Bedroom. I bought these 2 singles switches, a 2-gang box and an oversize wall plate on Amazon for a small bathroom that needed a night light to be flat against the wall and the light emitting downward. Installed the 1st switch upside down as a night light only but not turning on any other lights. So, I had to add a very small 120vac instrument pilot lamp inside the box, behind the switch, so the LEDs would have a resistive path to the neutral to illuminate. The pictures show the assembly with a fan timer next to this switch. The overhead light is switched on another wall and not ideal for where I needed the night light at the commode. When the overhead light is on or it's daylight, the sensor turns off the night light... perfect. The 2nd switch was installed in a bedroom and the nightlight is too bright for sleeping. These LEDs are turned upward to operate like a normal push top =on, push bottom =off like a normal rocker switch should be. They light up the ceiling and broadcasts everywhere. I got a small artist brush and very carefully painted black over the 4 of the 5 Led's. It's perfect now and can find the switch in the dark easily.\n46#That everything works. My light did not come on auto and no way to get hold of the seller.\n47#Nice switch. Two hots and ground no Neutral hook up. Why I gave it 4 star\n48#Had to Install upside down. So down is off in the USA, and that forces these to light UP-ward, because otherwise the LED lighted toggle-bottom is hidden. I needed light down, plus who wants light to shine up into your dark-adapted eyes???! I dont, so in my install, up is off so the lever bottom can illuminate downward. Made in China, they may not pay attention to down is off, but to be honest, a Decora switch is sort of ok this way, where a standard toggle would not be. It gives very little light BUT, in our bathroom at night, we can navigate just fine and avoid turning on a bright overhead and waking everyone. I also put one in my garage, also upside down, so it lights your path, and doesnt blind you.",
