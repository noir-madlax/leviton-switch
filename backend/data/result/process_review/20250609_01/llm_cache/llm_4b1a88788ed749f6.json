It’s common practice to J hook the wire ends, it doesn’t fit under the screw or between the wing and the screw head unless you mangle the wire. Not efficient for installers\n1#Great product and price! I’m replacing all the switches on our main floor and need to buy a lot of switches and covers. I’m very happy with the quality of this product and the price is saving me a lot of money. Highly recommend!\n2#Work but cheap feeling and sounding. I have used the name brand decora switches before and needed a bunch of three way and four way switches, which are very expensive if you buy name brand. Decided to try these in one way, three way and four way switches. First, the plastic edges tend to be sharper, with no radius to them, so they feel cheaper in a way, less smooth. The sound they make turning off and on is a sharp plastic click, unlike the more expensive ones. I am probably the only one in my family that notices but the name brand ones do feel and sound better.\n3#poor quality. I received only seven items, and they appear used.\n4#Well made, easy to install. These are great. I am slowly upgrading all the switches in our fifty-year-old home, so I'm using a lot of these and they're performing perfectly.\n5#DEFECTIVE - whole box is trash. DEFECTIVE! I bought these and installed many of them. They didn’t work so I assumed maybe I had some wires switched accidentally. That also did not fix the issue. After MANY hours of messing with these switches over a long period of time I finally called my electrical engineer friend. He also redid the installation and had the same issues. He finally checked the switches themselves, using a meter, and discovered that the switches were actually defective. Now it’s too late to return them and I wasted endless hours as well.\n6#They Look Great. Been buying these the last couple of years as I work my way around changing the switches in my house. Easy to install & never had a problem. Great price (especially for the 10 pack).\n7#Doesn't last long. I've replaced light switches every month this year. 2 of them being the same damn switches! And I come from a carpenter background. These are trash!! Home Depot here I come!\n8#Good quality. I want to upgrade my old light switches around the house. I bought 1 box of 10 pieces and all are working fine. Size fit to my plate and color matches to the 1 way switches. My only comment is it quite loud when in use. Other than that, it is a good buy.\n9#Great switch. Operation feels robust\n10#Perfect fit. Perfect fit\n11#Good value for the money. They look well-made in a good value for the money\n12#Look Great but break. Easy to install and work well but will break under the Wrong person’s thumb…\n13#Switches that work. Installed or rather replaced old switches with these. Very easy to install and they all work.\n14#So far, a 100% defective rate... These will be going back as soon as I get replacements and pull the ones I've installed back out. They have a 4.7 rating as I write this, so perhaps I just got a bad batch, but bad they are. I've installed 3 of these so far with a 100% defective rate. Each works only intermittently. I had originally stopped after the 1st one was acting up straight out of the box. For that one, over 2-3 days, it went from sometimes working, to mostly working, to ok, I think it works now, to still refusing to switch on sometimes. The 2nd two have been more definitively in the \"switch it on and see if it works...\". If it doesn't, you can flip it 100 times and it still won't. Then, minutes or hours later it may decide it is finally ready to turn on after all. In the attached video taken by my wife, I believe she is flipping the switch, it is flashing on for a moment and then going out, and then she is cycling the switch again and getting the same result. All lights on that switch circuit are in sync, so it isn't just the one light shown. I have wired perhaps 300-500 switches/sockets/etc in my day and never seen this kind of behavior. In general, switches are sort of a \"they work or they don't\" thing. If they don't work they stay not working. If they are flakey, they are flakey in a consistent way (usually from a marginal contact). I didn't actually need a full box and just went for it as I do have some other non-LED compatible electronic 3-way dimmers I could swap and the box price was less than 4 switches. Given the rating, I've considered an exchange, but probably will just go grab a few from the hardware store. If I exchange and a new box of these works, I'll update this review.\n15#3 Way Decor Switches. Nice to save money over big box prices. Changed all my switches & plugs to modernize home\n16#Great switches. Good quality\n17#got these to match my Google voice controlled switches. easy way to update to the 21st century\n18#Broken. A few switches arrived broken. Would have returned them had I not already installed the majority.\n19#Excellent for switching out older switches. Was selling out house. Had some ugly older almond colored ones. The price of these is cheaper then the big Hardware chains. Easy to install, and work.\n20#Good switch. Replacing all switches that I don't want automated with this switch. Good switch and easy to install. Almost got rid of all the ancient toggle switches. More than half the old switches fell apart as I pulled them out of the wall, was definitely time for an upgrade/replacement.\n21#HORRIBLE - I never thought light switches could be this poorly made. I know my kids aren't the easiest on light switches. Because after 10+ years of use, a few of our house's original rocker switches broke and I needed to replace them. I tried these Enerlites as replacements and every single one (10+) broke within 3 months of use. Their design is horribly flawed. They work when you test them but the pivot for the rocker is a tiny piece of weak plastic that fails with even relatively gentle but regular use. I've rarely been so utterly dissatisfied with a product. I have resorted to using ugly but durable traditional toggle switches simply because this product has shaken my faith that I can find a semi-reliable rocker style switch again. AVOID!\n22#Very affordable. Easy to install (I’m also an electrician) installed about a month ago and zero issues\n23#Amazing. I love these switches because they were fairly easy to install and the best part is that it works for single pole or 3-way! Highly recommend\n24#Quality light switch. This is a good quality rocker light switch, and is fairly easy to install. I really like that is can be installed as either regular light switch or 3-way, your choice. I would purchase again.\n25#Cracked. Poor Quality. Many didnt work - really dissapointing. What I thought was a great deal, cost me a ton of time troubleshooting all the switches installed. Replaced same as old - and switch didnt work - thought had the travelers / common crossed - but ended up being contacts not consistent and ended removing until found problem - this one was completely cracked. Not good for electrical work - same yourself time and get leviton switches.\n26#excellent service. fast service and easy to install.\n27#Good switch. Good price & a quality switch\n28#Fail consistently within 6 months. I purchased a number of these switches and have had to replace all where regular use is needed with Leviton decora. These are made very poorly and the paddle pops out within a few months. In the picture is the second set of switches I installed from this purchase of 10 single pole - these were just as poor. Avoid and just get name brand.\n29#As described. Easy to install\n30#WORKS GREAT. Works Great.\n31#Good replacements. I am going through my house and replacing all my old 25 year old toggle switches with these panel switches. The wiring is easy. Once you do want to get the hang of it, you know how it’s wired so you don’t have to worry about not having instructions and each one of them.\n32#All around good product. Easy to install. Works with LED lights. Look nice.\n33#Good value. One thing to keep an eye is install it as flat parallel to the wall as possible to have the edges perfect on the faceplate.\n34#I did not like these. They aren't bad. They look fine and so far seem to work on 300 watt outdoor flood light applications. My beef is they are a bit hard to wire. There seems to be a bevel on the back of the screw or something that makes it difficult to keep the wire on the screw unless you do a complete wrap around. Might be better with 14 gage but my house is wired with 12. Will use them, just won't buy more.\n35#All 10 broke within 15 months. I manage a couple Airbnbs and do most of the maintenance myself. Guests beat the crud out of a lot of items, light switches included. That said , the 3 fixtures where I used these are replacements deteriorated much much faster than the other switches with more name brand products. These are cheap because, well you get what you pay for. If you are extremely gentle with turning things on and off, you might get a year or two out of these switches. Either way, spend a few more bucks and get a bigger name brand.\n36#Everything is amazing except for one thing. The switches are not as durable as I’d like them to be. Between 1-2 years I’ve replaced half of 10pack. The frame brakes in the middle causing the switch to no longer hold its place. Great price and lovely finish. Just doesn’t last.\n37#Attractive but disappointing. These are genuinely aesthetically attractive switches, and I love that they offer so many different looks. Unfortunately, they’re not of great quality. I bought 40 switches in total and I’ve installed 28 so far. One switch completely fell apart as I tried to install it. Five switches had at least one stab lock that failed. I normally use Leviton switches and I’ve never had a switch fall apart, and only one stab lack has failed (I’ve probably installed 500 of those). I really wanted these to be great - I don’t like the raised lettering on the Levitons, and I don’t like that Eaton switches come loose when you remove the terminal screws… but these are not the way to go.\n38#Very cheap. While installing the first 5 switches, 1 of the rockers didn't work it just flapped back and forth up/down with no resistance or the click that happens when switching it, and 2 others the plastic on the back where you push the wire in shattered when pressing a small flat blade in to release the wire.\n39#Nice looking. Love the new look from the flip switches and installed with the screwless covers.\n40#Quality issues. Two of them broke while installing. Defective items in the box\n41#Address update eases to the rooms after 19!years. East of installation\n42#Works for me. I installed these throughout my house! They are good quality and I have had no problem with them!\n43#Push0-in doesn't work in one of the holes. I purchased a box of 10 switches. Consistently, one of the holes in every switch can't be pushed in. So I have to use the side wiring which take more time to install.\n44#All scratched up! Unusable, useless! They came all in one pile and all got scratched up. They are useless. I can’t use these at any house! I’m so disappointed!!!\n45#Normalito. Ahi tirando\n46#Funciona muy bien. Funciona muy bien",
