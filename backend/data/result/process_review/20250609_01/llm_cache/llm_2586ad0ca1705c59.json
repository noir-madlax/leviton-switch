Have had two switches fail in the last month. Quality just not there\n1#Defective - up was off and down was on. switches were reversed - up was off and down was on, although the dimmer worked normally (up bright, down dim). When replaced by a different dimmer that new dimmer worked fine so something was wrong with these dimmers.\n2#Easy to install, work great. These are quality dimmer switches that are easy to install.\n3#They don't last. We moved into an apartment and all of these switches have been faulty and finicky, and then one finally broke for good (middle one in the picture). They are this brand and model. Same thing with the single Lumen switch by the door. I'd look elsewhere if you want hardware that lasts. Especially at this high price point.\n4#Super cheap plasticky sound and feel. I'm not even going to install this switch. Immediately out of the box I noticed that it has a very cheap, hollow plasticky click when pressed. There's also a faint metallic sound like a little piece of metal inside is vibrating. There's also something off about the feel of pressing it, like it takes more force than a regular switch to get moving, and then snaps in too quickly.\n5#This is white? LOVE Lutron, but they missed the mark on this “white” color. Ugh, not sure what happened here, but the switch on the right in the included picture is NOT white. For reference, the regular switch on the left is made by Legrand. And, in the same room, I already have some Lutron dimmers that are absolutely white. Bummer is that I’m finally getting to installing these (ordered a pack of three, and they’re all this gray color), well past Amazon’s return window, so I’m hoping a call to Lutron will lead to these being replaced with actual white dimmers. Now, as for dimming function, these are fantastic. The little adjustment lever on the body of the dimmer to help you achieve a true minimum-dim is fantastic, especially with cheaper LED bulbs that quite often will only dim to 10%.\n6#Excellent service and product. Items arrived when specified and are exactly as advertised. High quality product.\n7#Not all switch works. Be careful if you purchase multiple packs! I purchased the 3 pack, was very excited with these new dimmer switches. However, when I try to install them today, I found one of them doesn’t work while the other two worked fine. Talked to Amazon customer service but only full return for refund can be done… quite frustating for me. Be careful if you are buying multiple packs and make sure you test them all before installing any!!\n8#Beware — Received used switches. I was initially concerned when I saw the condition of the box (see photo) and heard something rattling around when I tilted the box a bit. My concern turned to disappointment when I opened the box to find all three dimmer switches had obviously been installed at some point and then returned. As you can see in the photos, the overall condition of the box containing the three boxed switches would make most people suspect that the item had been opened and used before. If you look carefully at the photos of the switches, you can see electrical tape on some of the wires, some of the wires have been cut short, the wires are curled at the ends from being wrapped around a screw or fastened in a wire nut, and something had been soldered on the metal flange on the lower side of each switch. In addition, there were only 2 mounting screws laying loose in the box. These are going back and I’ll look for a different source for the switches.\n9#Good product. Basic Lutron switch. If you have several switches to replace, this is a good choice. Highly recommended.\n10#Works great. I can see the quality of the item.. fits perfectly\n11#It handles 12 recessed LED lights no problem. I used it to control 12 recessed LED lights. Easy installation. Good dimming range.\n12#Sent a used, defective dimmer. Out of the three dimmer, one was clearly used and defective. It seems like they just repackaged a return without checking to see if it worked. We will be returning them. Very disappointing.\n13#One switch came with a quality issue. One switch was loose but still worked.\n14#Fast delivery & value. I was familiar with the Lutron Diva dimmer & needed a few more in my existing home. I did not need instructions, wire nuts or a switch plate so the \"bulk\" packaging reduced the price 20%. Great value & Prime delivery was next day.\n15#Game changer! Love these switches!!! Game changer and saves electricity. Comes with 3. No plate included.\n16#No wire nuts included. Why send a product that requires me to connect wires with wire nuts but not include any wire nuts? None in any of the included packages. The switches themselves are fine, but I had to make a special trip to the hardware store for what was missing.\n17#Great Electrical Parts. I use these in my remodels and repairs all the time. Amazon has great prices on them and they ship fast, so no running around wasting time at the building supply.\n18#Worked fine for LED flood bulb set at first, then started flickering. Worked fine for LED flood bulb ceiling set at first, then started flickering when set to <50% brightness.\n19#2 of 3 dimmers arrived BROKEN and TERRIBLE customer service. This product was installed with the correct bulbs by professional electricians. Of the three-pack, one of the dimmers worked properly. One didn't work at all. The last one turned on and the dimmer worked for the first 24 hours, and then stopped dimming (the light remained stuck on the highest setting). If one of the three was problematic, I'd assume it was a fluke, but two of the three not working is a problem. These are not cheap dimmers, and because we were past Amazon's return window (remodel of course taking longer than expected before they were installed) we had to contact the manufacturer, who kept telling me \"because we're not there to verify the installation,\" they could not help me with a replacement product. I do not recommend working with this company.\n20#missing installation hardware. i bought the one pack lutron diva, and that came with installation hardware. then i bought this three pack but it didn’t come with the installation hardware—i had to stop and go looking... (the switches work fine) nickel and diming …\n21#Dimmer works well. These dimmers work well with my led br30 light bulbs. In the past i had dimmers that when they are turn off, there's a glow to the light bulbs. It could never turn the light full off.\n22#Arrived damaged. One of the switches works while the other doesn’t.\n23#Great replacement dimmers. Good quality dimmers at a fair price.\n24#As described. Lutron makes a good product\n25#Extremely easy to install and setup; works perfectly. My girlfriend decided to replace her switches with dimmers and purchased this brand. I installed them for her and was so impressed with the easy of installation and how dependable they are that I bought three for myself when I purchased my new home. First off, the company not only provides you with written instructions, but they have a link to their website which will put you through a quick Q&A to determine your exact setup before showing you video installation instructions. That made it super-easy for this DIY'er to figure out how to install them correctly. The installation is a breeze and after taking about 10 minutes the first time I installed one (partly due to limited room for cables in the electrical box) every other one that I have installed have been done in a about 2 to 3 minutes. Additionally, the dimmers have a control slider that goes behind the cover (not included) which lets you adjust the lowest brightness settings in case you are using LED lights since if there is not enough power, they won't light up at all. This has proven extremely valuable for me as I have one dimmer in a kitchen with three pot lights, one dimmer in a living room with a central chandelier, and the other in a music studio with a fancy LED lighting setup. In all three situations, these worked brilliantly. If you are looking for easy to install, dependable, and with multiple customization options, these are the perfect dimmer switches for you.\n26#lights are starting to flicker. lights are starting to flicker\n27#Works. Product did not include the cap to twist wires together. Luckily we had several on hand.\n28#Light Bulb needs to be Dimmable. They works but the lights bulb has to be dimmable or won’t work at all.\n29#These don't come with any wire twist caps, and single-wire caps are hard to find. Unlike the single-pack box of the same dimmer switch, the 3-pack doesn't include any twist caps. This is fine if you are installing with all 4 wires, because normal twist caps will work. But if you are doing a 3-wire installation and need to cap off the unused 4th wire, you'll have a hard time finding a small enough twist cap to tighten onto a single wire. That's annoying. But everything else about these switches is absolutely perfect!\n30#Great dimmer no buzzing. Great dimmer and didn’t buzz with the parmida recessed lights used.\n31#Good dimmer. Easy to install, worked well\n32#Good dimmers! Easy to install and use/operate dimmers. Beware of economical LED lamps (e.g. from Costco) claiming being dimmable. They are technically dimmable, but making humming noise with any dimmer.\n33#Simple, reliable. Between homes, business used around 20 in the last 15 years for bathroom exhaust. Very functional for bathroom towel warmers to prevent the moldy smell especially during the summer. Gives you options for shorter/ longer heating based on time of year. The warm towels are a nice touch during winter when you set it just before the shower.\n34#Great product! Very easy to install and works great on my light fixtures. So glad I got this three pack to update the lighting in my home.\n35#Not as Advertised ... Received, 3 Dimmers ONE DIFFERENT Style Two others used No wire nuts or screws to install 🤔\n36#FANTASTIC. The Diva series is a great reliable product. Definitely one of the top three dimmers on the market for the value we probably install 50 to 60 of these a week as a small electrical contractor.\n37#Very easy install, adjustable lowest dimness. These switches work great. I especially appreciated the directions which make installation very easy, even for lights with a common wire (more than one switch that controls the light). One suggestion I have for buyers is to check and adjust the adjustment dial (carefully!) before putting the cover plate back on. This will adjust your dimmest point so that it gets dim enough but not so dim that the lights turn off or buzz.\n38#Great Dimmers. I've used the Lutron dimmers for years. I have several throughout my current home as well. It allows precise control of the light brightness. Great product!\n39#Best of the Best. I have put in at least 15 dimmers now. I wish I would have found these originally. Not only has Lutron been reliable, the simple brightness adjustment on the side puts these over the top! Instructions could be a little more detailed for 3way wiring, but did not take me long to figure out.\n40#good deal but sell only let you buy one item. good deal but could only buy one item at the time of check out\n41#Worked with my LED bulbs as expected. I bought these dimmers to replace the ones I had when my new warm white LED bulbs didn't work with them. These were recommended for the bulbs I had bought and they work as expected.\n42#Best price so far. I buy this product for my business and have not found a better deal.\n43#These are a NO for this product. Read below for the correct ones. Okay, so we love these LED's and will retrofit the entire house, garage, and shed in them. I also recommended them to all our friends to get these materials here. Here is what works: The 6\" ultra thin recessed lights 5000K DAYLIGHT Dimmable with junction box is perfect. Home wiring was 12-2 to connect them in the living room low attic ceiling. YES!!!!!!!!!!!! USE THIS!!! Lutron DVWCL-153PH-2-WH Diva 150-Watt Single Pole/3-Way LED/CFL Dimmer with Wallplate (2 Pack), White ******* Max range dimmer with the ON/OFF adjust diming range setting (NEED THIS!!!) Has the wall plate too. YES 1- Leviton 6674-P0W SureSlide Universal 150-Watt LED and CFL/600-Watt Incandescent Dimmer, White ******Works good but no ON/OFF to set dimmer to max low and high settings so the lowest dim is still too bright for watching a movie at night. No wall plate. 2- Lutron S-600P-WH 600-Watt Skylark Single-Pole Dimmer, White Works well but no ON/OFF max dimmer ajustor and it looks clunky. No wall plate. NO!!!! Lutron Diva LED+ Dimmer for Dimmable LED, Halogen and Incandescent Bulbs | Single-Pole or 3-Way | DVCL-153P-WH-3 | White (3 Pack) You will get a straight turned on light and NO dim. The one in the outlet sparked many times just by turning it on. No wallplates and wire nuts are way too small. NO NO NO\n44#Wife happy. Looks good. Works well.\n45#Good buy with quanity. Great for recessed lights\n46#Missing Wire Nuts. When I bought these exact same dimmers at the Orange Box store, the had all the wire nuts included. These ones did not, hence, you'll need to provide the necessary wire nuts (4 required) for each switch.\n47#Install directions seem to be lacking. Install directions seem to be lacking the color code and the wires/switch are not labeled either. Every one of my other switches (besides 2 ways) is labeled. Not a huge deal if you know that red is normally line and black normally load but I almost hooked the neutral up to the traveler because it was not labeled and most of my other switches require the nuetral. Once installed, it works well and the adjustment lever is nice so that the lights don't cut out when dimmed.\n48#Lights flickered. These were the dimmers that were recommended for the high-hats we had installed. Once the dimmers were installed the lights would flicker on the higher settings. I purchased new dimmers Lutron dimmers at Home Depot and they worked perfectly.",
