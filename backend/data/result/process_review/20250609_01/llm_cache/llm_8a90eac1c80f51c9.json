The switch has performed well on an LED light fixture.\n1#Two-second delay for the Halo LED lights to come on. No delay with regular rocker switch. The headline says it all. After installation, the dimmer works fine. It was on the list of approved dimmers for the Halo sloped ceiling LED lights installed. However, it takes two seconds for the ceiling lights to come on. After that, the dimmer is instant to brighten or dim. But why the delay when there is none using the lights on a regular one-way Rocker switch?\n2#Still buzzes. I got this 450 watt led dimmer because the other dimmer I had (rated to 300 watts for LEDs) was buzzing and getting hot when all twenty of the 15 watt led downlights were on (I tested them individually and they actually use 13.52 watts at 119 volts and 3000k when running). I assumed that getting a 450 watt capable dimmer would solve the problem. Nope. It still buzzes, but isn't running as hot, though it is warm.\n3#Multiple color options and low-voltage compatible (no hum). Matches several colors with swappable parts in the box. Compatibility with compact fluorescent and LED bulbs a necessity\n4#Not as expected. While the choice of faceplates is great and the amount of wattage these units will take is one thing I appreciated, the quality of the unit was questionable. One of these switches was not new. One of the switches had been used and repackaged. The wires on this unit were twisted and the lengths of the leads were different. I don’t appreciate being shipped a used unit when I paid for a new one. When I installed them they both worked properly but I was also disappointed to hear a buzz (hummm) from the units when switched on. Not super loud but noticeable to me (and my wife says I don’t hear well :)\n5#Handles heavy loads. I noticed my previous dimmer was getting very hot. It runs a chandelier with about 30 halogen lights. I replaced it with another thinking that the old one was just worn out, but it didn’t fix the problem. Purchased this one, installed it, and everything worked fine.\n6#Highest Quality/Works Great! Highest Quality/Works Great!\n7#Universal Dimmer Switch. After a few emails and a conversation with a wonderful technical person (Vito) at Leviton, I bought and installed this switch. If you are not able to confirm compatibility of the less expensive dimmer switch, 6674 series, then this universal switch may actually work for you. It is about three times more expensive, but it works.\n8#Works .. sorta. Programing is challenging.... Hesitates when turning on\n9#disposable after 60 days. I purchased this to handle the large number of LED lights in my kitchen. The old switch was there for ten years or more. This one lasted a month or so, then suddenly stopped working. I removed it, cut back the wires, and rewired again, so it is on and off. Don't buy.\n10#Meh, not impressed. Replacing. After a couple months of use, half the time I turn it on, the lights immediately flash full-brightness for a split second, then enter an infinite cycle of ramping up to brightness and suddenly cutting out. When it is in this state, adjusting the brightness slider only serves to change the frequency of the flashes, and a simple off-and-on-again always resumes the flashy state (cutting power at the breaker seems to reset it). It is correctly in LED mode, with dimmable LED bulbs, and the minimum dimness has been tuned. For $60, I expected something a little more refined.\n11#Quality LED Dimmer. I have this installed on a 4-way circuit with 15 TorchStar 12 watt lights. Because of the current surge required by LED lights at startup, I wanted to get one with a lot of excess capacity. This one handles 450 LED watts. It works perfectly, with no hum/buzzing, no flickering, and generates almost no heat. The dimmer slide works very well and provides smooth dimming. Having just installed it yesterday, I am leaving the lights on most of the time as a test and playing with the dimmer slide. Works perfectly so far. If it gives me trouble, I will update this review.\n12#Excellent LED dimmer. I used this to dim 30 ea 12W LEDs in a large living room. Works great. Lights don't flicker, smooth operation. Mild warmth from the switch as you expect for a dimmer. When in the wall and a cover on, there is no buzz from the dimmer. There is a slight hesitation when turned on - I presume this has to do with getting the power set to bring the LEDs on at the desired level. It is noticeable but not annoying. On the plus side, this dimmer does not cause a \"flash\" when it turns on like some LED dimmers do. Note that there is a small \"locator\" LEd on the switch. You have to pry the cover of the switch off to set it up. The default is \"off\". Me not reading the directions, I spent about 15 minutes wondering if that was broken.. then durrrrrr I read the directions and all is well. This switch is part of a 3-way circuit. The other switch is a simple on/off 3-way switch. You cannot use two of these dimmers on the same circuit.\n13#Great. Just what I needed. No noise, easy instal, well made, function well.\n14#The Lutron DVLV-600P-WH is a better choice for MLV fixture with LED lamps. I did a side-by-side comparison of the Leviton DSM10-1LZ vs. the Lutron DVLV-600P-WH as a replacement for an old Leviton MLV dimmer controlling twelve Elco 1499 50W MLV fixtures installed about 20 years ago. I replaced the old 12V 50W MR16 bulbs with Feit BPEXN/930CA bulbs. The Leviton DSM10-1LZ worked fine but the lowest dim level was much brighter than the Lutron DVLV-600P-WH. For that reason, I prefer the Lutron model. FYI, here are the wattage readings I measured before and after for twelve MR16 bulbs. I did not measure with the Leviton dimmer installed. Before with halogen MR16s: Full brightness: 660 Watts; Lowest brightness: 112 Watts After with Feit BPEXN/930CA LEDs: Full brightness: 121 Watts; Lowest brightness: 15 Watts I'm sure I could get a further wattage reduction if I bypassed the 12 magnetic transformers on each fixture and installed a single electronic low voltage transformer at the beginning of the lamp \"daisy-chain\", but given the expense and hassle of doing that, I can live with what I have now as we don't run this light string very often.\n15#nice. These leviton switches are consistently high quality and they work well in my experience. This switch has not been an exception. it works well and it has a high quality feel to it. It inspires confidence installing this into my home.\n16#Good Dimmer. A bit on the expensive side, but comes with 3 color plates in the box (although for white, this generally is the default color anyways)., the dimmer works well for our can lights with LED bulbs, and does not have any noise from either the bulbs or the dimmer which is quite nice.\n17#Five Stars. worked well with multi bulb led fixtures.\n18#the dimmer works great. we have 24 100 watt equivalent led dimmable ... the dimmer works great. we have 24 100 watt equivalent led dimmable bulbs attached. the thing I like most is that had enough wattage support for the amount of lights we had. the 24 led lights totaled 324 watts.\n19#No Buzzing - Works Great. Installed this in my newly finished basement to control the lights in my workout space. This powers 14x 8-watt LED bulbs. No buzzing, and smooth dimming through the whole range of luminosity. I like that it comes with multiple face plates to match your decor, though I have no idea what to do with the extras. This is a high-quality dimmer that works well. I may purchase a few more to install in other locations in my home.\n20#Easy to install, easy to use. This is an excellent dimmer--easy to install, easy to use. I am far away from \"handy,\" but even I was able to swap out an existing switch for this one. The instructions are easy follow, and soon enough our chandelier was dimmable. The multiple cover plates is a nice bonus, even though we only used one of them. Excellent all around.\n21#Easy to dim to just the right amount of light... We are currently using this switch in our kitchen to turn on/dim the lighting fixture over the kitchen table. It is perfect. Switch on and off or have the option to dim the lights further if needed with a slider on the right hand side so you don't have to repeatedly hit the switch to dim the light and hope you didn't hit it too many times. I find this to be easy to use and easy to get just the right amount of light. Overall, we are very happy with this switch and if the need arose again would look to purchase this item.\n22#Great dimmer for LED, and even CFL and incandescent. I installed this in a 3-way circuit that has 3 ceiling can lights. I have LED Oppo brand flood bulbs in the fixtures. This dimmer handles them beautifully, dimming all the way down to a very dim light (maybe 5-10%?) with no flicker. I like the positive \"click\" of the Decora switch when you turn it on and off. And the the dimmer slide stays put at the setting you want unless you intentionally change it - meaning it does not change by accident when you use the switch to turn the lights on/off. The rest of my light switches are Decora, so this matches them nicely, with three different color faceplate options. One thing I had to figure out when wiring up the 3-way circuit was that there was 1 red and 2 black wires coming into the old switch. But this dimmer has 2 reds and 1 black. The black wire is supposed to connect to the \"line\" or \"load\" wire that always has power. I didn't know which of the two black wires in the wall that would be, so I connected the wrong one the first time (the one that went to the other switch rather than to the power panel). The lights worked OK from the dimmer, but the second wall switch did not turn the lights on. Once I swapped the two black wires, it worked perfectly. If you have a multimeter, you can test the wires before you connect them and find that one that's always 'hot', regardless of whether the second switch is on or off. That one goes to the black wire on this dimmer.\n23#electrician needed. I could not get this to work.\n24#DIMMER! The LED lights are a glorious thing. They don't heat up the house, they pull less power, and I got a stack of them free from the power company in a kickback program. Except that the fixtures had a pre-existing dimmer from the 90s, and the LEDs were always acting....strangely. So, I installed the Leviton Dimmer as a replacement. Now, a quick note: I didn't think about the fact that the switchplate cover would need to be replaced. But that's my own \"duh\" moment. Grab yourself a basic switchplate cover for a thick switch. Install was easy, as it only needed one position and I was replacing an existing switch. Kill the breaker, make the swap, go the hardware store for a new cover when you realize the old one won't fit. After that, it operates well. The dimmer provides a good amount of control. I would have like a darker brown option on the switches, but I'm changing the décor colors anyway. Easy enough for the do-it-yourselfer, even one who watches 3 Youtube videos about switch wiring before he tackles it.\n25#Cool Device! This does it all. If you need a full function dim control in a modern package, look no further. Note: you will need a new faceplate for this switch/dimmer, to fit it's form factor. This is a pretty sweet device for any modern home.\n26#But I got it right the first time and now my bedroom is super cool. On and off switch with a solid ... Works perfectly. Has 2 red wires and a black. That threw me because the wires in the wall were white and black. But I got it right the first time and now my bedroom is super cool. On and off switch with a solid rocker that raises and lowers the light. Its great.\n27#Works well. This is a great dimmer for areas that have lots of wattage to control, like my chandelier has. The unit comes with different switch colors, but no cover plate or wire nuts. I replaced this and another switch at the same time. The other came with the both of those, but no different color for switches. Make sure your kind of light is included. The other switch I replaced was for LED & CFL. My light was actually some kind of electric low voltage and the transformer blew a few days after installing the switch (which seemed to be working perfectly until it blew). This seems to cover the low voltage light that I will replace with an LED. It was as easy to install as any other switch. The toggle feels a little \"soft\" when using it - no solid clicking when turning the light on and off. When it is off there is a tiny green light on at the bottom of the switch. It is not very noticeable but would be enough to guide someone to the switch in a very dark setting. I see that it can be turned off, but it is so tiny it is not intrusive and I like it on.\n28#Does the job well. This switch is quiet, offers a continuously variable level of light, and doesn't produce any buzz. It has the look of any Decora switch, but with a small green light at the bottom when turned off, and a smooth slider lever on the side. This switch will work as a standard two way or as a three way switch. Since the dimmer level is mechanical, it means that in a three way installation, the other switch should be a non-dimmer type. If you want to be able to dim or brighten from either switch, you will need a different type of switch that doesn't use a sliding lever. The switch comes set for LED/MLV/Incandescent, which is how I used it. It also has a setting for CFL that I haven't tested. If you are using it that way, make sure to use CFLs that are labeled as dimmable. You may wish to read other reviews to find out how well they work with CFLs. There's also a procedure to set the minimum light level but I found that the range from low to high worked well for me right out of the box. If you find that the light flickers at the low end of the range and you are using dimmable lights, then you can set the minimum level a bit higher. Also, you should make sure that the full dim position doesn't turn it off completely, especially if you are using it as a three way switch. There are other types of dimmer switches that give you more flexibility on three way circuits, but if you are replacing a standard light switch, this should fit the need well. Since you may be replacing a standard switch with a dimmer switch, chances are that switch has wires pushed into holes or twisted around screws. If so, you will need to get wire nuts since they are not included.\n29#This is a pretty expensive non-smart home dimmer. Installation was a breeze. I had just bought a new dimmer for my pantry and installed an LED recessed light and was bummed to find out it didn't work with LED. This one does perfectly. I didn't even have to adjust the trim for brightness. It was only a couple wires and I kept the white faceplate - so about 10 minutes until we got a fully functioning light switch. The only thing I wonder about is the price value. This is a pretty expensive non-smart home dimmer. And adding smart home to a dimmer only raises the price online about $10 or so. So why not build that in? In all, though, I'm very happy with this product.\n30#reliable dimmer. Been using Leviton products for 25 years... rock solid products.... used this dimmer to control a chandaleer... very straight forward, worked on start up...nothing fancy, just a nice dimmer that is reliable! I have had some of these type dimmers in 20+ years, with no failures to date... cant say that about many manufacturers... great tech support when u call in...\n31#Easy setup and install. Really easy setup, as I just match the colors from the switch to the ones in the wall. Switching out the front cover is really simple as well, but I kept the white on. The indicator light is great for any room that needs a little guiding light to where it is, when entering a dark room. the dimmer is simple and precise. Leviton makes a good solid switch with many options.\n32#Good Analog Dimmer. There are so many variants of the basic dimmer that it can be confusing, but I think this is a safe bet for most people looking for a basic traditional design that works with LEDs. By \"traditional,\" I mean analog, with no need for a neutral or ground wire. The downside is that the switch doesn't have the pleasant dim in and out animation typical to digital dimmers, or the coordinated dimming in 3-way applications. I used it with an LED light, and it works well with no flicker. Keep in mind that the transformer in the light may cause flicker at low voltages with any dimmer. Installation is easier than normal, with the wires already installed. That means you don't need to mess with screws or push in connections. A ground is present, but not required for functionality. Build quality is good for the price, though the face plates are slightly flimsy. Overall, a good classic dimmer for modern lighting.\n33#easy installation, love my mood lighting! I installed this in a 3-pole environment and it works great. I appreciate that Leviton includes multiple colors for the toggle switch so I was able to exactly match what was in my house. One thing to remember is that if you install this in a multi-pole environment (multiple switches for the same light), the dimmer setting that the slider is set to will always control the brightness of your light, no matter which switch you use to turn things on or off. So if you previously dimmed the light and then turn it on from another room, it will still be dim and you'll have to go back to the other room and move the slider if you want to change it. I think that is a good thing but I can imagine it would cause problems for some uses.\n34#Terirble design. All of my clients are complaining the Leviton printed into the face of the switch collects dirt and frequently needs cleaning\n35#One is still working fine the other one quit working the first day. i bought 2 of these one six days ago .One is still working fine the other one quit working the first day !\n36#Works well with LED under Counter lighting. Switch while a bit expensive works well with LED under counter lights. Only caution is the switch is quite wide and if using in a multiple switch box be sure there is enough lateral space for it.\n37#Great solution with one drawback. I bought this to use with the \"SleekLighting GU10 LED, 8 Watt, Dimmable ,550 lm, Light Bulb Spotlight, Recessed, Track Lighting. Ac 120v UL Listed (Pack of 4)\" (https://www.amazon.com/SleekLighting-Dimmable-Spotlight-Recessed-Lighting/dp/B0156X9416). Note that these bulbs are not on their approved list (pretty short list). This was to replace a Maestro dimmer that was already in place for the halogen bulbs (that dimmer flickers with LEDs). Single pole installation was as easy as any other dimmer. Connect a couple of wires and it's good to go. Once installed, I noted that the minimum intensity was a bit too bright for my taste. So, using the instructions, I set the minimum as low as it would go. Although the minimum was now very acceptable, turning on the lights causes a \"flash\" of light. It appears that the switch is starting at what the normal minimum is and then lowering it rather than starting at the set minimum. I could actually see the lights dim after that initial switch to on. Had that not occurred, I'd have given it 5 stars (especially considering the bulbs were not \"approved\"). Note that I don't know if this would occur with \"approved\" bulbs. In the end, I ended up going with the Lutron DVCL-253P-WH (even though its minimum appears a touch higher that the Leviton) because of that flash. I'm still keeping the Leviton to use where the minimum threshold isn't as important.\n38#Five Stars. Works well!\n39#It works well and is easy to install but it's flimsy. It works well and is easy to install but it's flimsy. The plastic toggle and slider is thin. If it's used gently, it should be okay.\n40#Wonderful dimmer. These dimmers are very smooth. Starting at full dimming, there is a 3~4 second startup delay; with no dimming startup is very quick. I like the locator LED. The low-end range adjustment is good.\n41#Two Stars. Was missing replacement covers(with two different colors)\n42#Good dimmer with 3-color option. Have only used it so far for the bank of Six Retrofit LED 4\" can lights in my Kitchen. Gave it 4-stars because it has more audible buzzing than a Lutron DVCL-153P Diva Dimmer, its buzzes too/also,.... but about 50% less. Will now use it for an incandescent 18-lite edison style (40w x 18=720watt) entry light.\n43#High capacity and LED compatible. I have a chandelier that draws over 200 watts even when fitted with LED bulbs (54 of them!). Finding an LED compatible dimmer with this kind of capacity is challenging. This one does the trick and is working flawlessly. Dimming is smooth and linear.\n44#Five Stars. works great and looks nice. easy to install.\n45#Five Stars. works perfectly!\n46#Five Stars. As described\n47#Five Stars. works great and look nicer than what I could get at home depot.\n48#Nice to have multiple choices of colors. Works well and it's nice to be able to choose different colors",
