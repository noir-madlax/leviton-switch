Good quality, clean look, easy to install, easy to wipe and keep clean. Switch movement is smooth and clicks into place nicely.\n1#Defective! Defective and poorly made!\n2#Good switches. I installed several of these switches and they all work as they supposed to. They do click when you turn them on.\n3#Not the right color white. Not white like they should be. They done match covers or other switches.\n4#Advise. The product is really good but please make sure that you get the matching plates or buy something that comes with the cover plate. I bought mine from Home Depot and I can see the slight difference. Overall definitely happy with this purchase because they make the house look newer.\n5#Good functionality, not the white you are looking for. This is some sort of bone color. If these are to stand alone on a wall they will be OK, but for instance... I mixed them with other vendor which was snow white and the color difference is huge till a point that I get some other brand. Functionality is good though.\n6#No Plates. I don't typically write reviews but this is something that I feel people should be made aware of before purchasing. Although the Product Description section states \"Decor wallplate included, gloss finish\" the plates are NOT included.\n7#Brittle plastic that breaks over time. Do not buy. After a couple of years of using these they are popping out of the wall. They seem to break in the same spot as I have pictured.\n8#Bad batch, seller made good. Poor quality control, four of the ten donâ€™t work. The rocker function is broken and on one switch of the working six, the plate cover holes are not tapt. Ugh! 2/6/2025 - seller provided refund for items that did not work, updated review as seller provided prompt remedy.\n9#Modern look. Easy to install, look great.\n10#Switches work perfect. Just what I needed. Easy install great fit and have worked flawlessly since installed. Also a great price.\n11#great replacement. cheaper than buying from home depot or lowes. standard size. normal usage. fast shipping for amazon as well.\n12#Quality wall switch that works great. No complaints, no flaws, good quality.\n13#Not snow white. This is very obvious comparing with the switch cover I've purchased separately, this is not pure white or snow white, its off-white! looks weird.\n14#Not a bright white switch color - does not match other brands. After I got these I put them aside while I gathered other switches and sockets I wanted to replace. After the return date, I lined these up in a 3-gang switch plate and only then realized the switch is more of a light cream color so doesn't match switches I've got from 2 other manufacturers (smart switches). Too late to return so I'll probably give these to Goodwill. Bestten has two versions of white: items marked USWP4 (like this one) which they call white but is actually off-white, and USWP6 that they call Snow White. Most other brands mean the 'sniw white' bright white when they say white. Make sure you match. I found out too late and can't use these. I've submitted a description update request to ask them to mark these as off-white.\n15#Good quality at a good price. Works as advertised. Very good light switches at a great price!\n16#No more. I had purchased this product before and was satisfied with the quality, but unfortunately, my recent purchase has been a huge disappointment. Out of the 10-pack, two switches had serious issues where the internal mechanism was broken. This caused the switch to pop out dangerously when pressed, which is a major safety hazard, especially if children are around. I expected consistent quality, but this second batch has clearly suffered from poor quality control. I can't recommend this product anymore given the potential risks involved.\n17#Works but the clicks are LOUD. It does what it's supposed to do but the clicks are very loud, louder than the old 40 year knob switches. If I had to do it again (which I will, eventually), I'd find something a quieter action.\n18#Cheap a$$ switchesâ€¦. Idk, I shouldâ€™ve ponied up and got like a Lite-on or better quality switch. These clearly show they were made in China. Do they work and are UL listed sure but hold this in your hand with a different name brand switch and you will feel the difference.\n19#Good value. Good quality and better value compared to Home Depot\n20#Cheap. Switch cracked shortly after install.\n21#Good Product. Great value for the money. Works well and easy to install, if you are familiar with installing switches\n22#Si. It's looking good not using yet\n23#Excellent Quality.. Excellent Quality & Value.. Quick Delivery!\n24#Quality not good. Very noisy when toggling switch. Easily breakable.\n25#Very poor quality. Purchased two packs of these light switches. They look great, however the quality is terrible. Had 6 out of the 20 that I bought with the back black plastic broken and the switch falling a part. Was under a time crunch to finish a project and ended up going to Home Depot and buying the light switches i needed. Maybe it was just bad luck but donâ€™t let the price fool you and influence your decision to purchase something that you will possibly put in your home. Home Depot is not that much more money for a better quality item.\n26#Good fit. Easy installation\n27#Very happy. Well made. Lights come on and go off. So yeah I am happy\n28#Bad Quality. I installed 10 of these light switches 5 months ago and 2 of them fell apart last week.\n29#Best to pass on these. Flimsy and color off. Other better quality ones at same or lower price. Go buy the Leviton. Cheaper anyway, at least the old school one. These are cheaply made and feel it. The rocker \"rocks\" in the frame before engaging. The color is not the same white as others. A bit off and more yellow. OK if you are replacing all switches, but you really cannot use these next to another brand. Just look odd. Also, the quick release is troublesome if you need to take the wire out. These are not worth the added work and flimsy build quality. I bought a box of 10. Arrived today and going back today.\n30#Love it. Package arrive just in time,the quality ðŸ‘Œ..size is very good. Will be definitely purchasing more.\n31#2 came defective. I gave it a 3 star due to the fact that 2 of them were defective out of the box, I didn't want to return the whole set for just 2 that were bad. other then that great product great price.\n32#A good, high quality product. I am a contractor. I have purchased products from this company many times. Their pricing is unbeatable. They always include cover plates, which is a bonus. Well packaged, quickly delivered. Their products are made for ease of accurate and safe installation. In my experience, the products are reliable as well.\n33#Switches Breaking. Disappointed that two switches that I have installed in the past month have broken off the wall. Quality is very low. Amazons Choice should not be your choice.\n34#Be aware - not true white. These switches work fine, although they definitely feel a little cheap. My biggest issue is that although they're listed as gloss white, they are definitely more of a off-white/cream color and this becomes painfully obvious against the wall plate as well as the four-way switches that I have mixed in placed right next to the single-pole switches. Be aware if you have three- or four-way switches right next to these. Would have loved to know this before I bought and my husband installed 30 of these.\n35#Some have issues. So far I have one from the pack that you have to push hard on the top to get it to work. Poor quality I would say.\n36#Decora style single single pole switches. I purchased these in the past seems to be a pretty decent product for the money and a good value\n37#Nice Quality. Best bang for your buck, these switches are just as good as the expensive ones, and they feel like they are made from high quality materials, would deff buy again.\n38#Different design and manufacture switches in the dame order. Watch your order. Some of the rocker light switched had designed bend lines from fabrication and some didn't. It is noticeable when putting multiple switch in the same area.\n39#Great product. Works great\n40#Good value, works great. Well priced, easy to install, they look great.\n41#Mix of different switches that donâ€™t match! Mixed bag of switches that donâ€™t even match, half are missing the mounting screws. Would NOT RECOMMEND.\n42#Worked Perfectly. Great finishing touch to our remodel\n43#Nice inexpensive switches. The switches have a decent feel to them. They come individually wrapped which is good to prevent scratches. Installed like any other light switch.\n44#Great price ! Good product! Saving money! Good product at low price!\n45#These are great. Easy to install, works well. Canâ€™t beat the price\n46#Easy. Nice and easy to install",
