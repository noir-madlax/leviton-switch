REQUIRES GROUND WIRE. The whole point is it is old wiring. Sounds like work around treating the ground wire as neutral. All I know for sure is it is unresponsive in my situation and all the instructions I can find say GROUND WIRE IS REQUIRED.\n1#Must Have if you are installing this in a box w/o a neutral wire. This dimmer is a \"must use\" when you want a smart dimmer switch but you don't have a neutral wire in the box. You will need another outlet somewhere \"close\" for the dongle that actually bridges whatever protocol these switches use to wiFi. Works pretty good, although I have had to \"reset\" the dongle after a couple of months of use (couldn't control from my Amazon Echo's anymore without doing this).\n2#Works with my Antiquated Wiring. The dimmer came very quickly. I set it up and it didn’t work. So I called customer support. I to,d them how I installed it and he said simply, “you did it backwards.” Duh! I changed the wires and it works great. Setting up the schedule was very simple and it’s so nice to have a dimmer that works with my antiquated wiring. I have now bought three more of them.\n3#Great dimmer switch, a solid value. I purchased this dimmer switch kit because my home is older and does not have a neutral wire at the switch. The bridge easly connected to my wifi network. Unfortunately since the switch was purchased as used good it would not connect to the bridge. After contacting customer service I was able to reset the switch to factory default and get it to connect. I am controlling nine 85w equivalent LED flood lamps with this switch with no problem at all. No flickering and I can go from 1% up to 100% brightness. Just remember to update the firmware in the bridge and the switch using the Leniton app for best performance. The quality of the switch is very good. I have it paired with the remote companion so I can control the lights from the top or the stairs without going into the basement.\n4#Works like it says it does. My home was built in 1970, and this product allowed me to put my new ceiling lights on a dimmer since the house wasn't run with a natural wire.\n5#Works WITH Wifi bridge. There's a couple of other no neutral dimmers that work without a bridge but they're ugly , somewhat expensive, and for some reason fail too often. Leviton (Like a couple of other companies) a) looks decent and 2) seems always to be high quality\n6#DO NOT BUY LEVITON. All Leviton smart switches are piece of crap!!!! They are extremely hard to connect and configure, don’t work well with HomeKit and its connection is not reliable. This switch doesn’t connect with the bridge, and when I try to use it via Apple Home App it takes forever to respond. Don’t buy this!\n7#I trust Leviton. Love having my home wired with quality Leviton products. I feel safe and the conveniences of remote control and scheduling is fantastic.\n8#Didn’t work out the box. Had to get a replacement because the first one didn’t work right out the box but replacement works great.\n9#Dimmer completely unreliable. I waited too long to install this so unfortunately I can’t return it. I have over 50 remote control devices. This is by far the worst. It installs pretty easily, although is a little too deep for a standard electrical box. The in/off seems to work on the app. Switch works fine as a switch. But dimming on the app is sooooo bad that I would say it actually doesn’t work. Range of dimming although it shows 0 - 100% is closer to 10-25%. For my purposes a complete waste of money.\n10#Exactly what was needed. I was able to install it with no issue and it works without a neutral wire, which was my main reason to buy this. Setting this up through the bridge was straight forward and it works well.\n11#C'est merveilleux !!! Ça fonctionne à merveille et nous avons une maison de 1957.\n12#Easy to set up! No problem setting this thing up. It response slightly slower than other Leviton switches which don’t need a rely. (I have multiple switches from Leviton) My apartment was not wired with neutral wire. So, this switch is my only choice. If you use HomeKit, you don’t even need to sign up a user account with Leviton.\n13#Very hard to setup new account on mobile. When a company doing embedded stuff like smart devices just chooses not to make it easy to setup, I say don't use them. Like seriously, you couldn't make it so I can login with my google account? What made you think your app was ready for prime time exactly? What's worse? Their inputs aren't even auto-completable by google's password manager.\n14#Perfect for what I wanted. Works perfectly on my lamp post. A variety of schedules available to set up\n15#Great Value. Simple to install and work great.",
