Dimmer worked fine, switch side stuck closed out of the box. Not good.\n1#Item is exactly as described. Item is exactly as described.\n2#Works perfectly. Easy to install. Love the dimming features. I’ve started replacing all my switches with this style\n3#Recommend. Seems pricy but easy install, looks nice and works great. We have it for a bedroom fan light combination and works great. Kids 7 and older have no issues using it.\n4#Great. Works perfectly.\n5#Negative stars. Wired this up and it didn't work. Asked for a replacement and it was delayed. Unimpressed across the board.\n6#Great product with even better customer service! I live in a house built in the ‘40s with only some minor upgrades. I have a ceiling fan and three light fixtures controlled by a dual single gang switch. I had three LEDs in the fixtures for over 10 years. They were 60w equivalent and I usually found the light to be too dim, but I didn’t want constant glaringly bright light. This switch seemed like the perfect solution. It looked like an easy project, so I devoted time on Sunday to knock it out. I got everything hooked up per the instructions and nothing would work. The LEDs just blinked and the ceiling fan wouldn’t turn off. I researched online and only got more confused until I decided to take a chance and see if Lutron support was open on Sunday. They were! I explained my whole installation process and what was happening. I mentioned that I had old bulbs still in place because I wanted to get the switch working before I broke out the ladder to replace the bulbs. The agent told me that the bulbs were probably the culprit. (It didn’t make sense to me that the ceiling fan switch wouldn’t work either), but I changed the bulbs and the problem was solved! Even though I think about switches as being two separate circuits, there are internal electronics in these modern switches that are effected by each other. I’ve got a great new switch and I learned something new!!\n7#Works perfectly! Amazing! Expensive compared to other switches, but the only way I’ve found to dim my vanity light and control my fan in the same switch. Had an electrician install since I had one doing work already and he said it was super easy.\n8#Works perfectly. Amazing product. Just what I need it!!\n9#Do not buy. Quit working after 2 months. Junk. For a switch at this price that’s unacceptable.\n10#Great product easy to install. Works perfect with the GE LED lightbulbs. I had the other brand Leviton and my lights just always flicker on bright so I just took out that other new one I had put in and put in this one and it works like a charm. Wife is happy.\n11#Small and effective. Typical excellent Lutron design and build. Very compact. Works well.\n12#Problem Solver. Not inexpensive but solves problems. The upper switch is the dimmer and the lower is an on/off switch which I will link to smart switches to allow dusk to dawn control of outdoor lighting, and this is in a bank of three switches rather than opening the wall for a fourth switch.\n13#Great switch for dual pole solution. Popped this switch in to control my coach lights (on/off) and the secondary dimmer switch for my exterior entry light. Perfect solution and quality.\n14#Love it. Easy installation, functionality, and it looks great.\n15#I don't recommend this. It failed after 32 days. Worked fine but then failed while on. Put back the old mechanical switch and that works. I'll probably stay with the old fashion but reliable version. Once I find the Lutron website I'm going to post a similar review.\n16#exactly as shown and fast ship. it is clearly written, but the fan switch side has 3 specific speeds, which does not work for a second light. Had to send it back, and bought the correct one from the same manufacturer\n17#Yes more expensive, but worth it. I bought two different switches for this project. A Cheaper one and this one. Once I opened the box for each, it was clear that this one was superior. However, keep in mind that only one of the switches has a dimmer. That worked for me but Amazon has cheaper \"double dimmer\" switches available as well.\n18#Good Product. Everything was good!\n19#Good quality. Did a kitchen remodel. This worked perfectly for my island lights and breakfast table. Keeps the same light setting when shut off. Love the dual dimmer function\n20#Used trash for $10 more than a new one at home depot. Didn't even come with a box. Clearly used. It worked and I needed to install immediately so I didn't return it.\n21#Nice Product. Good Quality\n22#Did not work and was unable to return it. The switch, once installed did not work. 30 day return was before it was installed. Product deflective!!! Buyer beware.\n23#Pretty great. The top button is a dimmer. You can set the dim level and 1 press turns the light on to that setting. A double tap turn the light all the way on. A tap when it is on dims it down to off. The bottom button controls a second light and is not a dimmer. It works great and corrected my error of only installing one box in the vanity room of the bathroom.\n24#did not work. Hooked it up and the non-dimmable switch was automatically on, which is for the garbage disposal. Tried switching wires but same result.\n25#Flickering Lights. The LED lights randomly flicker after installation. Other dimmers work on the same circuit with the same bulbs so I've isolated it to the dimmer. Trimming did not fix the issue.\n26#Excellent. Works perfectly and Dims as should. Install was fairly simple if you’re an electrician.\n27#Wish it worked. Order 2 of these and both were bad out of the box.\n28#Gets the job done. Dims my fixture perfectly.\n29#Kinda “colicky”. The only reason this is getting four stars is because when you turn it on you can hear a loud noticeable click from inside it. Just personal preference is all. Switch works as it should\n30#Excellent for cases where a lighting fixture and ceiling fan are in the same single box. Excellent for cases where a lighting fixture and ceiling fan are in the same single box. The Fan needs only an on/off switch, while the lighting fixture is served by a smart dimmer that HAS MEMORY for light output.\n31#Lutron Maestro LED+ Dual Dimmer and Switch | 75-Watt LED Bulbs/2.5A Fans, Single-Pole. Love this dual dimmer switch. After adding wall lighting to new vanity plus exhaust fan with bath remodel, we were able to control all without having to expand the existing switch box. The dimmer switch is awesome.\n32#Excellent. This is a very well made and designed switch. Does exactly what it is supposed to do , one dimmer circuit and one standard switch , recommended\n33#The only device on the market like this. This is the only device on the market with a LED dimmer on top and a separate single pole switch on the bottom on a single yoke, way overpriced for what it is, but it does solve a problem. This device is extremely deep and wide with the heat sinks so beware when you’re installing. Do you need extra deep the box or it won’t work.\n34#Works as advertised but it's pricy. This was easy to install and it works well. I separated my porch lights so that the recessed lights in the ceiling of the porch is connected to the dimmer and the switch is connected to the door/wall light. The cost was definitely a bit of a shock but there aren't many dimmer/switch products available with this configuration. Cost was the only reason I deducted a star from the overall rating of this product. Make sure you visit the Lutron support site to get detailed installation and programming instructions. The printed instructions that come in the package doesn't provide all the information and may be needed.",
