After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the Three Way Multi-Location Control Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The Three Way Multi-Location Control Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment.

Switch was defective. The 2 silver screws (Travelers) are shorted together in one position. This condition should never be possible in a 3 way switch. Tested out of circuit with a multimeter.\n2#Well made & should last. This is a well made 3 way switch. It does what it was designed to do.\n3#Awesome product. Works very well. recommend buying this if your light switch stops working.\n4#Good fit and worked as expected. I actually only needed a 2 way switch but this one worked just fine. I had smart bulbs attached to a switch which had a dimmer. This caused them to flicker. Once the light switch was changed to one without a dimmer, the flickering went away!\n5#Worked perfectly! Needed a new light switch for my laundry room but didnâ€™t have time to run to Loweâ€™s so I ordered this one on Amazon and it was perfect! I have replaced a lot of light switches in our home and this one was just as high of a quality as ones that Iâ€™ve purchased from hardware stores. Would definitely purchase again!\n6#Very tactile feel. Love these. Very good springy pop in either the up or down position. I only used one of these and went with a different brand to do the rest of my house and wish I didnâ€™t, the up on those is decent but the down feels like a sponge.\n7#Good quality. The ones in my house i didnt know were so cheap. These are well made and feel well made.\n8#I HAVE NOT USED SWITCHS LONG EOUGH FOR DURABILITY, BUT SO FOT THEY ARE WORKING FINE. OVER ALL IS WELL.\n9#Easy to install. Works great easy to install. Like white better than cream.\n10#works great. perfect replacement for my failed 3-way switch. great price, works perfect.\n11#Dimmer replaced. 3-way required and works as advertised.\n12#Good quality switches. Quality switches. Packaged well\n13#Perfect two way switch. Perfect two way switch\n14#Replaced 38 year old switches! I use these on my 1985 Hatteras yacht. They work perfect and what a difference they made between the new switches and the old clunky sound making switches! I am so glad I bought them on Amazon and didnâ€™t bother going to a local hardware store! They were a great deal and have been working like a champion!\n15#Works perfect. Installed it right away as I needed it quick and works perfecting as expected.\n16#As described. As expected\n17#Good Quality Outlet. Good quality. Plugs stay in outlet. No sloppy fit.\n18#Good quality. As described\n19#Top quality. Installation ease.\n20#good product. product was as described, no complaints, and fast shipping\n21#Replaced malfunctioning switch. It is just a 3-way light switch, needed to replace an older one - works as expected.\n22#Very good deal. Great deal and works perfectly.\n23#Cheaply built. These switches have terrible connections. Hard to install to spec. Recommend that you do not buy!\n24#Light switch. I am pleased with this purchase.\n25#Gets the job done for cheap! Installed one of these switchâ€™s to replace an old bone colored switch in my living room. If you have a basic understanding of electrical wiring it shouldnâ€™t take hardly any time at all to install this switch.\n26#Have pressure lock feature for convenience. The pressure lock feature made the connection of wiring a breeze, soft contact. This is a 3-way switch, not 2-way .\n27#Simple replacement. It was a simple ten-minute job to replace the old switch and regain the convenience of the three-way circuit. Instructions were clear and complete.\n28#Perfect fit. Perfect fit\n29#Good quality, great price. Bought two of these to change out a couple old outlets that were no longer working. Priced at almost half of what the local stores wanted. They were actually in stock, and the right color. Installed with no issues and work right. Itâ€™s been a week and the house hasnâ€™t burned down yet, so thatâ€™s a win in my book. ðŸ˜ƒ\n30#3 way switches. Worked fine\n31#Caution with electricity. Now problem to replace if you use common sense. Need to shut off power to switch before starting.\n32#Quality product. Durable material\n33#This is a single pole switch not 3 way. This is a single pole switch not 3 way. Has the wrong barcode on it.\n34#Careful: Provided wiring instructions not entirely accurate. Pay close attention to your existing wiring before swap.\n35#I used this with a three way switch. I was getting a three way switch from Amazon and needed this switch to use with it. Both switches are working well.\n36#Works great. Exactly what it says it is .\n37#As advertised. Easy to install\n38#Works well. delivery was on time and easy to install and works well.\n39#Outlet. Works well.\n40#Worked exactly as described. Easy to install. Just what I was looking for.\n41#Purchased 2, both arrived with damage. Both of the switches I purchased arrived with significant marring of the switch itself.\n42#It works. Would buy again.\n43#Didnâ€™t work. Did not work\n44#It suits well. I put it in place of the broken switch. It works well.\n45#Does the job. Installed fast, turns on. No need to for a switch twice the price. Either the light'll go on or it won't.\n46#Just what I needed. Looks great, easy install, fast shipping. Thank you\n47#Good wa quality. Good quality",
