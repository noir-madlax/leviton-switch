Unfortunately mine stopped working 6 months later. Was a great product until then. Was using for150ft of LED string lights.\n1#Great exterior and interior dimmer. It works perfectly!\n2#Not good. The remote stopped working 32 days after receiving so I'm outside of the return window. :/\n3#Works great with remote! Works great with my light sets on the back porch.\n4#Works great. I use this to control the ON/OFF and dimming function for an indoor lamp with 3 LED bulbs, works like I expected.\n5#Bulbs will blow even led which mine are. After only using a handful of times I've noticed alot of blown bulbs I'm assuming it could be from the up and down of the dimmer.unfortunatly only worthy of 3 stars\n6#Died very quickly. Was nice while it worked. Died right after the return period ended.\n7#it works! this was a nice surprise. I was looking for an on/off switch, but the dimmer makes it better- using a 200 watt, that's a lot of pull on power. the dimmer allows you to keep it low so it doesn't turn off as often.. So far so goo!\n8#I don‚Äôt suggest this product. Literally burnt out after I plugged it in\n9#Doesn't work well. beware, does not work well\n10#Perfect! Perfect for my LED patio string lights\n11#Unit needs to be powered on with the remote. It does what it is advertised to do. My only concern is that I want it to come on (at the desired brightness) when the light sensor it's plugged in to switches on. This unit defaults to OFF when power is applied.\n12#As advertised. Having put up a string of patio lights in our gazebo we found the lights very bright. This dimmer is great. It allows you to lower and or raise the brightness with the remote. It even turns the lights on and off.\n13#Works as advertised. Works as described, right out of the box. Just plugged it in and the remote operated as expected.\n14#Great but... It does not dim enough\n15#Great solution! Great solution- great value - looks and works as described!\n16#as indicated. as indicated\n17#Seems good quality should last specially since it was designed for outside but using indoors. I purchased this to be able to turn my table lamp on and off and dim next to my bed. Works great all I did was put some double-sided tape on it and attach it to the back headboard will be purchasing one for the other side of the bed.\n18#Great product. Works beautiful üëåone year and still working the remote control works great\n19#Works great. I use this to dim and brighten my Edison string lights due to them not coming with that feature. I've used it for a while now and it works great. Comes with a remote. It's been outdoors in rain, snow, 100 degree weather and still functions as new.\n20#Unexpectedly perfect. Learned that other lights I had were also dimmable, that were on the same power strip. An unexpected perk!\n21#Easy to use and works great! I had a different model that sometimes worked sometimes it didn‚Äôt. This one works like a champ! üëçüèº\n22#Easy solution for outlets without a switch. How did I not know this was a thing?! I've had my bistro lights plugged into an outlet that has no switch. I rarely used them because plugging them in and out in the dark was obnoxious. This remedied that. The remote works great and what's better is now I can modify the brightness of the lights. It's great!\n23#Works great. Excellent product\n24#Only 1 plug in, but a splitter worked great. I have been looking for a dimmer for some lamps in our living room. This was exactly what I was looking for.\n25#Works fine. Prompt delivery\n26#Nice to have a dimmer with the remote. Works great, Thanks\n27#Use with dimmable LED lights. Works at a long range like it says. Used it to control patio string lights.\n28#Great addition to a floor lamp. Works well for a lamp that was otherwise not able to be dimmed. Now with this wireless dimmer, the lamp is much more usable.\n29#does not flicker when dimmed. Works very well. Dims without flicker the LEDS we got at Amazon.\n30#It worked on 225 feet of large string lights! For this money you cannot beat this. I put out 225 feet of edison party light strings in my backyard. It gave me 4 levels of brightness which I appreciated when you want light ambiance that doesn't look like the sun is on at night in your backyard shangrila.\n31#Good Buy. I like the 90 degree plug. Lots of power levels. Remembers last level. 400 watt capacity is higher than many others in that price range. Would buy another if needed.\n32#Does not work. Terrible. Did not work out of the box. =(\n33#Exactly what I was looking for to control extremely bright LED lights! Great outdoor switch with the ability to dim lights! I have a set of LED lights that were way too bright and this switch allowed me to dim those lights and control them remotely with the remote control. The remote is still working after a year of use. Highly recommended for those looking to control lights inside or outside the house.\n34#I like it! Works great, longevity to be determined.\n35#solved my problem! So I own a wedding venue and every time we host a sweet 16, the decorator always brings in those huge number 16 with the marque light bulbs in them. They are always so bright and it kind of kills the vibe on the dancefloor. I bought this dimmer so I can plug in the numbers and be able to control the intensity from anywhere in my venue. It is a great product!\n36#great outdoor dimmer. dimmer works great! really like that it has a remote to turn off/on. really nice product\n37#Doesn't work with modern LED lamps. It doesn't support 0v-10v LED dimming control. Considering that is the industry standard, this unit is obsolete. Don't bother, it won't dim your LED lamps.\n38#Works perfectly. We have regular string lights (non-dimming, LED, from a warehouse store), and they were often too bright. We purchased this dimmer with the hope that it would work‚Äîand it does!! We can dim them perfectly, with no flashing or strobe effect, just nice, adjustable levels of light. Very happy!\n39#Works as advertised. Unit was easy to set up. We use it to adjust the brightness of the small white lights on our Christmas tree. The larger colored lights are adjusted separately using the LumenPlay app. (Tree came prelit with both sets of lights.)\n40#Another fantastic aspect of the TREATLIFE dimmer is its memory function. We recently acquired the TREATLIFE Outdoor Dimmer Plug, which comes equipped with a 100FT wireless remote and boasts an impressive IP44 weather resistance rating. This product has proven to be an excellent solution for controlling our outdoor hanging string lights, especially since these lights are situated under a covered porch. The weather resistance is particularly beneficial, ensuring that the dimmer plug can withstand the elements while still providing reliable functionality. One of the standout features of this dimmer is its wireless remote, which offers an impressive range of up to 100 feet. This means we can comfortably control our lights from inside the house without having to step outside, which is especially convenient during colder months or inclement weather. The remote's user-friendly design allows us to effortlessly switch the lights on and off, as well as adjust the brightness to create the perfect ambiance for any occasion. Another fantastic aspect of the TREATLIFE dimmer is its memory function, which remembers the last dimmer setting we used. This feature adds a level of convenience we didn't realize we needed. Whether it‚Äôs setting the lights to a cozy glow for a romantic dinner or brightening them up for a lively gathering, we can quickly return to our preferred setting without having to fumble around with adjustments each time we want to use the lights.\n41#works great. works great\n42#Works great. These are great for my patio lights. Work so well that 2 friends purchased them.\n43#Garbage. Stopped working after a few weeks. Only used a few times\n44#Works great! Before this device, I bought 2 at Home Depot and Lowe's but they didn't work correctly! But this one works great 5+\n45#Pairing Treatlife outdoor 1 plug wp dimmer. Purchased last year and after trying to pair witk.Orbi mesh system for about 2 hours it finally connected to 2.4 /5 mbps system. Lasted about 2 months then quit working could not reconnect I gave up and Purchased a Kasa wp outdoor receptacle dimmer which connected just fine. I will not take a chance buying another after 2 hrs of trying to reconnect this year for controlling Christmas lights and finally gave up and bought.2 Kasa outdoor dimmer plugs which connected to Orbi just fine.If you have an Orbi mesh system I don't recommend buying a Treatlife unit since obviously there is problems with connectivity to this system. (I also have 8 cameras and many other smart plugs connect to our system of different brands...gosund and kasa with no problems) Stan M.\n46#Works with LED Xmas bulbs! We purchased an expensive pre-lit LED artificial Christmas tree and were disappointed with how bright the LED lights were. This little device works brilliantly- just plug into the wall, plug tree into the dimmer, and you're off to the races- 10 levels of dimming and a remote control for just over $20. Well worth it.\n47#Great quality. I wanted to dim the brightness of the lights on my Christmas tree and this thing is perfect for that. After the holiday I plan to use it for my outdoor patio lighting to set the mood for mellow evenings on the deck.\n48#Works great. However, it you use a timer along with the dimmer switch. The lights will not come back on. You must manually turn on the dimmer switch to activate the light.\n49#Excellent Dimmer! The dimmer works as advertised and is excellent for adjusting the brightness of your Christmas tree lights!",
