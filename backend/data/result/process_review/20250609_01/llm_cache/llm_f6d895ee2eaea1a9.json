It takes a while for me to install it but it worth the effort. I installed it in my main bedroom, so I can turn off the light without get off my bed. It has timer function and I set up a timer for my fan.\n1#One was defective and took me 3 days of my life and a trip to lowes to figure out. I bought this to automate my outdoor lights—seemed simple enough to install. Luckily, I got the 2-pack, or I would’ve thought I was just doing something wrong. I installed both switches, but one of them wouldn’t work at all. I rewired it 4–5 times, consulted ChatGPT, and even went to Lowe’s to get a voltage tester, thinking maybe it was an issue with the wiring or the electrical box (even though the lights worked fine before). After several more rewiring attempts and reinstalling the old switch, I gave up and called Amazon. They gave me a refund and sent a replacement. The new switch arrived the next day, took 10 minutes to install, and worked immediately—so yeah, turns out I was sold a dead switch. Thanks for that.\n2#E. Esa porquerías no sirven\n3#Doesn’t Connect – Total Waste of Time. I've never been able to get this Kasa Smart Switch 2-Gang HS200-2 to work, no matter what I try. I've spent hours troubleshooting and it simply refuses to connect to my Wi-Fi. I tried: A 2.4GHz-only network (even disabled 5GHz), Older routers, Multiple resets and power cycles. Each time, the switch broadcasts its default Wi-Fi, and the app claims \"connection successful\"—but it's not. I have to manually connect to the switch’s Wi-Fi, enter my own Wi-Fi credentials, and then it just spins for 10–15 minutes before saying “pairing failed.” and keeps blinking orange and green. I've restarted everything (including the switch and router), reinstalled the app, and even tried different phones—same result. It just won’t connect. This has been a huge waste of time and money. I normally like TP-Link products, but this one is a complete disappointment. Avoid it unless you enjoy endless setup loops and frustration.\n4#Don't buy this crap. They send you old product that they know is faulty. Don't buy this crap. They send you old product that they know is faulty.\n5#Easy to Connect. I have installed three of these so far in the house and it works great. Once you get the first Kasa product installed the rest follow suit. The initial one was a little difficult to install but that's just an issue on my part. I have 12 total Kasa smart switches in my house and all work great. Installing two more torrow and hope to install 4 more soon in addition to the Kasa thermostat. Good value for the money as you can see. The Kasa app is easy to use as well and I have had no problems getting the switches to work in the app. If you get an Echo product to go with the switches it makes it even better. Being able to remotely turn off those pesky lights your children left on while trying to run out the door is amazingly convenient. I have had no connectivity issues unlike other reviews. I have a good router and plenty of WiFi coverage in the home so it makes me wonder if the issues with the other reviewers were that they didn't have good coverage in their homes. The dimming feature worked flawless as it was able to dim lights i didn't even know could be dimmed in our home.\n6#A Must buy! My regular go-to smart lighting switch. Affordable and installs easily. Other brands like GE dies when a rainstorm comes... I've had to change out so many. This one, keeps on working!\n7#Extremely complex installation. I won’t buy it again. It’s better to just buy smart light bulbs.\n8#Easy to install and use. This is great in our house to time our outdoor lights above our garage. I have switch for the garage indoor lights that is not on a timer and then the second switch for the lights outside the house and timed them to go on each night. I am not an electrician but know a little bit and it took me about an hour to install however my current plugs were quite disorganized. I am sure it is much quicker to install but regardless anyone can do it with a little time. Seems to hold up well, I’ve had them for almost a year now with no issues.\n9#These are amazing. These are amazing, makes life so much easier, if I leave a light on I can turn it off with a push of a button or from the app.\n10#4 stars. This switch was categorized as a frequently returned item. I gave it a try and found it worked well. The installation was easy. It is compatible with both Google Home and Amazon Alexa. I wish it had a smaller form factor.\n11#Can be intimidating if there's a ton of wires in a small junction box on your first experience. Update 04/12/25: I was able to get this figured out; this was user-error (Dunning-Kruger). I shouldn't have chosen a two-gang junction box with such a huge bundle of wires in it to get my feet wet with trying to wire in smart-switches. I was trying to wire in the black hot wire into the bundle of black hot wires, but this was wrong. The correct configuration was to just wire in the two black wires coming from the smart switches into the existing two hot wires (and one to the existing ground wire, of course), then unscrew the wire nut from the massive existing bundle of neutral (white) wires, then wire the two (white) neutral wires from my two smart switches into that bundle. Viola, everything worked flawlessly, although I had barely enough to room to jam all that into the junction box. OLD: I checked the description of this product carefully since I have experience with successfully wiring two smart thermostats to three separate air conditioners. I also work for a smart / IoT device company (that involves wiring) in a troubleshooting department, so I felt very comfortable taking on this task myself, although I have only done rudimentary 120v projects. I took off the light switch cover and examined the wiring before making my purchase. Mine had one neutral, one black (hot / line), and one ground, plus one huge bundle of 6 - 8 black (hot / line) wires and one huge bundle of 6 - 8 neutral wires. I photographed the existing wiring to make sure I could return to the existing wiring (just in case). I didn't see anything wrong because the description only mentions requiring a neutral wire, but would later discover it requires two black (hot / line) wires. The existing two switches each had one black, one white, and one neutral connected. They did not have two blacks connected as expected. The wires were connected to a giant mess of wires featuring two huge wire nuts of 6 - 8 white and 6 - 8 black wires each (respectively). First I just attempted to connect the switches as close as possible to the old switches, but this did not work. Flipping the breaker caused the switched outlet connected to a lamp to just flicker and the ceiling fan not to respond. The two smart switches just flashed orange and were unresponsive. Finally, I found the hot wire in the bundle of black wires using a voltage tester, isolated it from the rest, then bundled it into a wire nut with the secondary black wire coming off each switch. Same result. I tried a few more variations, but nothing would work. I'm flying blind on how this junction box / room was wired. I understand the way this junction box was wired is not TPLink's fault, but what is their fault is installation was billed as \"a breeze\" and the requirement of the black wires are happily glossed over. I could have saved 6+ hours of troubleshooting if they had put in the real requirements (two hot/line, one neutral). It seems like TPLink is okay with making some customers miserable wasting their time rather than put in the description how difficult it is for many customers (which you can do an internet search on, which you'll find my issue is not uncommon).\n12#Terrible product and even worse app to manage the terrible product. One switch does not work and the one that does work is like rocket science trying to set a schedule. This is the worst app I have ever used for anything. I am throwing both of these away and replacing with the ones at Home Depot which are called Hubspace and are so much better in every way and cheaper.\n13#Life Changing. Super easy to install. Connected to Alexa seamlessly and I use the voice controls every day.\n14#If you have a problem with this product, save yourself time and headaches return to Amazon. This is the worst company for product support I have ever encountered. I had a defective product it took over 10 days for them to authorize a return, then they wanted me to pay for shipping.\n15#Great. Exactly what I expected and great price too. Easy to install. I only used one of the switches on my existing double switch.\n16#Best of the best. These switches are amazing; out of all I looked at, I can't express myself enough on how easy these are to install, set up, and use.\n17#Hard to connect. Wow I am glad I got the two set on sale. The first one I installed would not work. The 2nd one would not connect to the wifi I tried 10 or 15 times. Then I went out for a couple of hours came home and it connected on the first try. We will see if it works tonight.\n18#Broken out of the box. Broken out of the box\n19#Get the job done. Love this so unique\n20#Easy to Install, Easy to Set Up! I bought these as a replacement for the first set of smart switches I bought for my kitchen / dinning room area. These ones work so much better than the ones I had originally bought. The physical buttons work great and setting them up to the wireless was very simple. The app is very straight forward and easy to use, integration with Alexa was also super easy. If you are trying to decide which one of the hundreds of smart switches out there, you can feel safe choosing these.\n21#Bad experience. Wouldn't connect to the app. I spent a week troubleshooting this device, rebooting the Wi-Fi router, splitting Wi-Fi bands, etc. When I contacted customer service, they emailed me an unhelpful AI generated essay of possible solutions I could have found on Google. I followed up and asked for actual assistance, and Kasa has been silent since.\n22#Saving Money Using Automation. Never will I ever have to pull in my driveway and see that my three houselights had been on all day. Switch feels premium, app controls are simple to setup. The instructions packet is detailed and is useful when installing.\n23#Box seal well n easy to set up. This device is not easy to install, it might need a wallplate spacer. After installation it is very easy to set up with wi-fi. Once it is ready to remove, the device funtion perfectly. Very recommend\n24#Defective switch. One of the 2 switches had an electrical short within the switch. You could hear it when the box was jostled or the wires going into the box were wiggled. Not acceptable for electrical devices such as this.\n25#Install tips - I've had over a dozen for 3 years, no issues. I've installed 14 of these in my home since 2021 and never had a severe failure but before I installed any of them I put in a whole house surge protector. The other things you might want to have are Wago wire nut alternatives which make installation very easy when you have a lot of wires or you are putting in more than 2 switches in a box. I also recommend outlet spacers. The 5-way splicers from Wago are ideal when putting in 4 of these. Wire all grounds neutrals and 1 of the blacks from each switch together outside of the box. You connect the ground, neutral and supply once, then each light/fan and you are done in the box.\n26#Super Easy set up. Love these, easy to hook up (full disclosure I am an idiot and even I was able to do it) and works well with my Alexa\n27#Love Kasa products!! I love Kasa product and I was so excited for these! We were able to connect them ourselves using the directions Kasa provides but this will require connecting wiring. No need to hire an electrician though, if you do some research and follow kasa’s step by step instructions, you should be able to get it!\n28#Didn’t work. Didn’t work\n29#Super Easy - Very Convenient. These are great. I am replacing all of the old switches with these. They are super easy to setup. I have three of them up and running without issue.\n30#It works grate. Easy setup and works amazing.\n31#They work great, easy setup. Live these, gonna put them all through the house.\n32#Switches. Easy to install and set up.\n33#Works Great after Difficult Connection. If you are running a Mesh WIFI network, with just 2.4 & 5ghz, this switch will not connect, even when you turn off the 5ghz. If the mesh network has 6ghz capability, turn off everything except the 6ghz and then it will connect. After connection, you can turn the 2.4 & 5ghz back on and won't have a problem. If you don't have 6ghz capability, I'd go with a different manufacturer. Otherwise this switch has worked great!\n34#Great product. Have many of them . Work great\n35#I will never go back to normal light switches. These things have made my life so much easier. Forget to turn off the lights? Ask home assistant. Need to turn on the lights and don't want to get up? Easy! Need to automate them to turn on and off at specific times? You betcha. They were easy to install, the switches feel nice to press, they are easy to connect to your network and connect to Google Home, they look premium and the plate is high quality as well. If you are thinking about it just get them. My only downside is that I need to keep buying and installing more every time I remember a light switch that isn't smart.\n36#Works great. Easy to setup.\n37#Does not work! This product does not work as smart switch! This item only works manually. KASA also has terrible Customer service is terrible, when sending a text message, reporting this problem they responded with a text they will look into this problem. to this date, Jan. 3, 6 months later I still have not heard back from them: either by text or phone call. BUYER BEWARE!! p.s. I had this installed by a professional.\n38#Makes the junction box tight. The switches work and weren’t too bad to get running. I did run into an issue when I tightened the mounting screws. It must have flexed the switch and caused the indicator light to turn off of green . I loosened the screw and it seems to work fine.\n39#The switches integrate easily and work consistently with Alexa. I’ve been using smart home devices for years and these were easy to set up and have never given me any issues. They install like regular switches so that was not a problem. However, my home was built in the 1970’s and I had to swap out the old 2 gang electrical box for a $5 new one because the switches were too recessed and the cover plate wouldn’t snap on. Changing out the box was easy and I think it’s just an issue with 2 gang boxes being smaller in older homes. I have several Kasa plugs and those have been easy to set up and problem free, so I think that it’s a good brand for an Alexa household.\n40#Great Wi-Fi Light Switch. Love these products and this new addition to my others does not disappoint. I had some difficulty hooking up to my home network but a call to Customer Service fixed the issue!! Great quality for the price.\n41#Happy. Look good did what I wanted\n42#Excelente y sencillo. Fácil de instalar y configurar, es una excelente inversión\n43#Horrible Experience. One of the switches worked but the other would not connect to our Alexa. My husband does maintenance for his profession so he is very familiar with connecting electrical items. He called the company and spent several hours on the phone with them twice trying to get it connected. They finally agreed that their item must be faulty and said they would replace one of the switches. Then they sent us an email saying that we had to register for their warranty to get a replacement. Then they proceeded to tell us that we had to pay the shipping for the replacement item. No acceptable! We are returning through Amazon and will never purchase from this company agagin!\n44#Stopped working a few minutes after installation. Renz was a help getting the switch set up with my phone. Unfortunately, within minutes of hanging up, the connection was lost and I have been unable to get it to reconnect.\n45#Easy installation. I bought the product for outdoor building. It was easy to install and connect to my network.\n46#Easy to install and connect. The instructions are clear and switches were easy to connect to the app but make sure you install them one at a time or you will never know which one you are working with.\n47#Best I have used in 8 years. After my experiences with the KASA app and the TP-link switches… I am 100% sold…\n48#Great smart switch solution. I originally purchased three individual kasa switches and utilized them in another room in my house. The setup is extremely simple and I found the integration with Alexa was very smooth and they are my go to switches. This set has a specialty cover plate that ensures the two switches sit in perfect alignment and are flush giving a great finished product over using a conventional cover plate and having slight alignment issues with individual switches. While I don’t have an issue these switches are not a conventional on or off type switch but function as push type switches. When off the switch has an illuminated symbol showing it is ready to be operated, when on the symbol is off. I will be purchasing additional Kasa switches as I expand my smart home.",
