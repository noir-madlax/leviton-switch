El kit de interruptor inteligente Lutron Caseta es una excelente opción para quienes buscan una solución de iluminación inteligente confiable y fácil de usar.\n1#Great!!! The first alternative to a 3 way switch that actually works.\n2#Quality hardware, great purchase. These are great. I purchased an expensive chandelier for my family room and the electrician wanted almost 1k to wire it. Instead I purchased the plug in Lutron Castia smart plug and wired it in my attic back in 2005 I use a Pico remote in my family room to turn it on and off. It still works perfectly and saved me a lot for install costs. I have all of the primary lights on these switches now so I can turn them on and off automatically.\n3#Good. Good product\n4#Reply to SDS. Reply to SDS I have almost 20 of these switches. One gave me the breaker problem similar to what you’re reporting. It was solved by acquiring a different breaker module. Sometimes I understand they are not always compatible. I have not had any trouble at all since switching this module. I hope this helps\n5#I did not get the Pico remote. I did not get the Pico remote with this pack. Very unhappy.\n6#Great product, once you figure out how to install it! I love Lutron products and how well they integrate with Alexa. Now can turn on/off all of my lights in house via Alexa while sitting in my easy chair, or light up my house over the internet while I'm away. Great system. BUT, don't be fooled with their propaganda that light switches are \"easy to install\". Even if you're knowledgeably about \"neutral wires\", etc, the instructions will NOT really help you if you've got anything other than a plain vanilla install. The instructions for the wall switch are really for the Pico remote. And in my case, I had 5 wires coming into my old swtch, but the instructions only are relevant for 4 wires. And don't expect their YouTube videos to help much either. They are redundant and not relevant. But after spending 3 hours, I was able to install the new dimmer switch and add it and two Pico remotes to my existing Lutron Caseta system. And I love it!!!!\n7#Requires additional device to control with phone app. The description on Amazon says: \"For Alexa, Apple Homekit, Google Home (Hub Required)\" I had no intention of using any of these. I just wanted to use the app on my phone. So I didn't think a hub was required. The directions say otherwise. This should be made clear on this page. I think way more people will want to use the app than the other devices so it should absolutely be inuded in options the need a hub in the description.\n8#Have to buy a separate device to use these products with alexa or Google. Crazy how you have to get the app and but an additional hub just to use it with alexa. I would have bought a different brand if I knew\n9#Picture and description not accurate. This product is not capable with Alexa or google home or apple. Least not the one I received. The box I received was a small box not the one pictured for this product. That was the main reason for getting this product\n10#Simple 3 way. Needed a 3 way where getting travelers too would have meant tearing up the King stud wall. Just simply wired in the switch like a normal single pole and programmed the iconic 1 minute and bam. 3 way. I’ve been using these throughout the house for three years now and they work everywhere.\n11#Cheaply made compared to other Caseta switches. The switch is fully functional, but the buttons are cheaply made and is much notice compared to the other Caseta dimmers. I guess they have to cut costs for the lower price.\n12#Opened box. It came with an open box. Everything there except for instructions. Good thing we have internet.\n13#LOVE this product. I used it for a light switch that was in an inconvenient area in my dining room. I had trouble installing it because my light switch wires were not in the correct way. I called customer support and they were AMAZING. They walked us through how to fix it, and we were able to get it working immediately. LOVE their customer support and because of this, I highly recommend them!!!\n14#Very good choice. Very good choice\n15#Expensive but worth it. Easy to install and the caseta system is rock solid for me. Only downside is the price . Flicker free led dimming.\n16#Doesn’t work. So disappointed. My husband tried to install and it would trip the breaker every time. Not sure what’s wrong, but super disappointed. We planned on using this so we could switch a door swing and have the remote on the other side of the door, because I’ve been told by multiple electricians there isn’t enough room to put a box on the other side of the door. Mostly bummed because I spaced returning it before we went out of town. So now I’m out money with a switch that doesn’t work.\n17#Addicting... I am finishing up a remodel and have been OCDing on switches, sensors, timers and remotes. The wireless remotes work well. You can also link multiple switches to one remote. I have a remote that does the LEDs in the ceiling and another one that does the ceiling and lights over the mirror. it allows you to adjust individually or together. Easy to install and program. The middle button can be set to the dim level of liking.\n18#Saved a major amount of work. I would have had to open up a textured sheetrock wall to get a switch in for a 3 way circuit due to the construction. I removed a 2 gang cover plate and installed a new 3 gang plate with the new remote and the same 2 gang box. It took a total of 15 minutes to install the remote and the dimmer. It saved me a tremendous amount of time, plus my texturing skills are lacking. Nobody else knows it isn't hardwired. A+ product.\n19#Super easy to install. I received switches this morning. It was incredibly easy to install, and took less than 15 minutes. Programing the remote less than 1 minute. The wired switch installed in the barn, and the remote in the house. Was wondering if the 2 switches would be too far from one another?? No problem..all good. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!\n20#Treats. Nice looking. Easy to use. Good product.\n21#Love Lutron Cassetta. I am in my second old house. Lutron Cassetta works great. The light dimmer switches do not need a neutral wire. The fan control does. We had an electrician install a new ceiling fan and had the neutral wire run at the time so was able to do the fan and light separately. Works great and looks great. Different colors so I wouldn’t have to look too closely.\n22#Excellent solution for 3-way lighting without rewiring the room. I had been concerned that I could not have three-way lighting in my master bedroom, but this is the perfect solution!\n23#New to Lutron (but have 24 years of automated light switches) - Learned Some Important Things.. Just recently switch to Lutron product line, and my fan switch install went flawless. I installed this switch on my outdoor lights and learned a lot along the way. Hopefully this will help someone else. - When I installed the switch, I have neutral wires in my gangboxes (house built in 2000), and was shocked that this switch didn't have a neutral connection. You don't need it for this switch, which is great for those that don't have the wire, but it was a first for me as my Zwave switches always needed it - Switch was installed correctly, but had no lights on the switch itself, and while I noticed my outdoor porch lights were showing a dimly lit bulb, hitting the on or off on the switch did nothing. I was convinced initially it was wiring, but lo and behold, the true issue was the bulbs that I installed. I had purchased some cheap no-name brand LED bulbs and they were not dimmable (I think). Upon changing the bulb, the switch showed operational lights, and everything worked fine. In my two fixtures, I initially only changed one, and that was all it took to get it working. I confirmed the same issue when I installed another switch for my 3 deck post lights. Changing a bulb to a dimmable bulb (while I wait for matching replacements) was all I needed to do to get it to work! - Pico remotes are amazing, and can be used for many different things. Love that I don't need hardwired Z-wave accessory switches anymore, and these make it so less crowded in a multi-gangbox! Highly recommend those looking to make the switch from Zwave, WiFi and other lower quality switches. I will say my Zwave installation was flawless in operation, but ultimately got sick of the low quality and frequent failures. Anyone considering a \"WiFi\" switch should not do so, but I'm not going to gain much in functionality over my Zwave switches, the reliability and Picos are the big pluses.\n24#I have over 50 of them - First Time One Broke. Well I guess I was due to get one bad one. I have over 50 in my home and I love these things but this was my first bad one. Installed it for some wall lights and it never worked DOA. Electrician could not finish the job and did not have time to go to Home Depot 30 miles away to get one near me while they were on the job. So he had an older model on the truck and he installed it. So I paid for this twice... OUCH. One out of 50 ain't bad.\n25#Dimmer. Product worked out great.\n26#Now I have two switches in my kitchen. Now I have to switches in my kitchen. They work very good.\n27#Excellent. I love the technology! Battery only needs changed approximately every 2 years.\n28#Pico battery dead in arrival. Pico remote had a dead battery on arrival\n29#What happened to Lutron? I bought several of these things just a few years ago, and they've increased the price of this kit by $30. As well as taken out the wall plate for the pico, that used to be included. Heck, there was once a time not long ago that you could get a kit with the hub included for less than this. Insane.\n30#Casita pico switches. I’ve installed hundreds of these good product value is at the same as the big box stores. I tend to buy them off of Amazon. It’s just easier because I simply don’t need them till I use them.\n31#Best Dimmers on the market! I installed and used so many of them in multiple houses and every time i am in owe! They work and look great!\n32#Good dimmers. Really happy with these dimmers . They are not all created equal but we love these and will get more to replace bad dimmers soon. Electrician said they are good quality .\n33#Expensive but cheaper than an electrican! I have used these on remodels for customers but first in my own home. Our dining room light should have been wired with a 3-way switch, I even had the wall opened at one point on one side, but where the switch was on the other side, I would have had to tear that wall open too, in order to feed 14 3-wire to it. With this dimmer and Pico dimmer problem solved in 20 minutes if replacing a one gang switch with the dimmer and mounting the remote on a wall by itself. My set up took longer because I changed out 3 toggle switches for all deco switches. So had to install all deco wall plates; one a 2 gang the other a 4gang (Pico) remote. Pricing was good as well Box stores sell this kit in store for the same price, but it does not include the wall bracket. They charge an addition 8 for it. Shipping incredibly fast, ordered it in the box store late afternoon was at my door by 10:54 am. the next day. I COULD NOT find in the included instruction sheets how to pair it. But simple Press and hold off button on wired switch till lights blink, release. Press and hold off button on remote till lights blink 3 times on wired unit, release done. You can add a hub so you can have voice activation I don't need that just glad we now have switches on both sides of the dining room.\n34#So convenient without rewiring! Love it! Easily replace any existing dimmer switch and instead of rewiring for 3 way just use the remote! Perfect for elderly or anyone who doesn't want to get up from bed to turn off the room lights!\n35#Good for months then blinks nonstop and NO RETURNS. Purchased in May. Worked until January, zero issues. Remote worked great. Then all the lights start to blink. No pattern, just on / off / on / off sporadically every second. Nothing else in the office changed. Had to remove and put original switch back in place. Went to return, there’s no return option. DO NOT BUY.\n36#Enlightened. Love the caseta line works every time and the optional hub and app are very easy to use. I’m an electrician for 40 years and I recommend this brand over all others and yes I have them installed in my home\n37#I bought these for multiple rooms. I used to use the Maestro switches (with remote), but they didn’t work once I changed to LED bulbs. I don’t always have neutrals available (power runs to the light and then to the switch instead of vice versa), so I can’t use the smart switches. I put one in my husband’s office; he likes to be able to dim the lights remotely. I have another in the bedroom (with two remotes). This allows us to turn off (or on) the bedroom light from bed without having things rewired to install four-way switches. I have a third in the laundry room; the room is inconveniently designed because it’s under the stairs, and my storage shelf covered the light switch— so, I installed a Caseta switch and put a remote on an uncovered wall area. This is a much cheaper solution than having someone custom-build a cabinet for my under-stair storage wall, and, so far, it’s been great. There are probably other places I could put this, but, if I don’t need a remote, I prefer the slider on the Diva dimmer switch.\n38#Excellent lighting control system and affordable. Excellent product period.\n39#Amazing Solution. This thing is an amazing solution to 3-way switching problems when you don’t have the wires available to complete a conventional circuit. I had power in my shed but was unable to switch the outside lights off from the house. The shed is approx 30 yards from the house and the wireless connection is flawless between the shed and house.\n40#Works Great. I had to find a a way to use overhead reading lights controlled by a dimmer switch overhead which was going to be covered by new upholstered wall panel. Rather than relocating the switch and rewiring it. I replaced the switch with this remote controlled switch. It works perfectly even while covered up. Like the customizable favorite setting button also! It's fast and responsive.\n41#Amazing great switch. No WiFi needed no running a second wire.\n42#Works very well. I use it in Home Theatre. The light switch is on the outside of the room and I got tired of getting up and adjusting the old dimmer switch. This remote works through the wall and I can set it to go to the proper level for watching movies by hitting one button. Easy to operate. Old dimmer would not work properly with LED lights that I switched to from CFL. They would buzz and flutter. This works great. I do wish the remote was about 3 times the size. It is tiny\n43#Worthless if more than 30 feet from smart hub. I planned to add a light to my out door garage. It is more than 30 feet from my smart hub pro. The hub pro will not pick the new wall switch up. The Pico remote will work but not a single smart feature is available. The Pico remote while registered with the Lutron App cannot be used in a smart mode through the App. This system is a high-tech rip off. THIRTY FEET is the MAX distance to talk to the switch. It is definitely a product from yester year. I have the wireless extender also. After a extended search I found a link to using the first plug-in dimmer as a range extender. This solved the problem.\n44#Perfect Product For My Needs. Perfect Product For My Needs\n45#This made life so much easier! These are the best! You can control your lights from a different part of the house without having to run wires!! Our electrician told us about these and I'm obsessed. We bought two and put them on our side of the house to control lights on an addition that we just added. It was the perfect solution! They are easy to install, just like a light switch, and I actually get excited to push the buttons, they just have a good feel to them. You can program your dimmer setting as well, which is a really nice feature. I highly recommend these instead of running wires! Super easy!",
