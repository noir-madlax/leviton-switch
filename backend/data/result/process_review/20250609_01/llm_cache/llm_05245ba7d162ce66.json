Not available at Home Depot in black color I needed.\n1#Not easy to install but works ok. A bit of a pain to install but works as it should.\n2#Perfect. Absolutely what I needed\n3#Quality Switch. Quality product that works as it should.\n4#works as should. i like the black look and it does the job\n5#Love color. Beautiful match\n6#Works. Just wanted to swap out our light switch from white to black, this did the trick!\n7#Quality made. Looks great and is made well.\n8#Cheap and easy. I used this in my bathroom remodel bc I bought black switch plate covers and wanted the switch to match. It was easy to replace and I did it myself. The black looks so much better with the rest of the room plus dirt and finger smudges don't show as much.\n9#Love these black switches!! Redesigning our half bath and wanted an elegant black out effect with our new black switch cover. These worked great!\n10#STUNNING ACCENT. I ordered black switch and outlet & covers for an off-the-wall project and these are going to be stunning when I get the wall done. I am impressed! Very excited to complete the project; hope I can add to this review once the room is done & add photos.\n11#Great. Matched my pac man light switches thanks s\n12#It works great. It's amazing! Flip up to turn on and down to turn off! lol I bought to replace an old old failed light switch. Works great.\n13#Good Buy. Made restroom stand out more\n14#Great price. Just what I needed\n15#Worked great. Looks good. Did what it was supposed to do and looks good.\n16#Not good! I ordered 3 of these and they are so crooked. My husband was able to use 2 of them but the third one was crooked beyond repair. Asked for a replacement and I have to return the one switch. It’s not worth my time or gas to drive to the shipping place for a $3 replacement :(\n17#It's a lightswitch. Does what it's meant to do and it has a very satisfying click when flipped.\n18#Good covers would be nice. Works as expected, didn't come with covers.\n19#Light switch. Works as advertised. Easy to wire.\n20#Easy to install. Not much to say it's literally plug and play.\n21#It’s black if you need that. I needed black switches for a kitchen with a black backsplash. Couldn’t find them locally so ordered these. Quality switches so no complaints. Of course white ones at local stores are much cheaper so I paid for the color.\n22#Easy installation. Easy to install and looks good with the black gold plate cover I purchased from Amazon.\n23#Good price and easy to install. Standard switch and easy to install.\n24#it may control the inside sunshine. I have been flicking this thing for days, it doesn't turn me on or off, but it does make the room go light, dark, light, dark....\n25#Solid, clicky light switches. These are basic, solidly built light switches. I bought these in black to use in a garage. These switches have a nice hefty click to them when turned on and off. If you want quiet switches for use in your house, these aren't the switches for you. These seem to be more a commercial style switch. Excellent for the value, highly recommended.",
