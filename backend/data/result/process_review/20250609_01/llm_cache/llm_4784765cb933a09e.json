Works great and exactly what I expected\n1#Good Product. This switch was very easy to install. It appears to be made of quality material and the spring function for the two rocker switches are very good. They have a solid and quiet feel when pushed. A good product that I would purchase again.\n2#Worked perfect. They did exactly what they were supposed to do\n3#No problems. Good fit. Holding up well in sunroom.\n4#Works like it should. Good quality and works Great. Easy install\n5#Duel switch. I liked this item, I used it for a ceiling fan and light, good quality.\n6#Light switch. Type of switch exactly what I was looking for. It arrived the day after ordering. Problem with removing one of the screws. It had been forced into the wrong hole and took a great deal of trouble to removed.\n7#Good quality. Good quality, and nice positive snap when it turns on and off\n8#Quality piece worked perfectly. Delivery and no hassle at big box store is key for me. Price is fair. It installed and worked as expected. Thanks i will be back\n9#AIDA rocker switch. Switch fit in nicely and matched light switch cover. Easy to install.\n10#Love it! Great product for the price. A bit tough getting the screws to tighten but a little elbow grease and it was worth it.\n11#Wish it would have worked perfectly. We have been trying to figure out what's going on for over 8 hours. Electrician had to come. Turns out one of the switches didn't work. I thought it was my wires and it was the switch. Wish it would have worked. Would have looked so nice. ðŸ˜”\n12#Works fine. Very nice product\n13#Solid Double Paddle Rocker. This is a nice double paddle rocker with switch plate. It's well constructed and saves space where you need two switches. It's as easy to install as any switch and switch plate and a good price for a decorator double switch.\n14#works perfectly. great for laundry room lights. love the push switch vs the old fashion flip switch!\n15#Easy Install, Works Great! Excellent upgrade for the old-style switches. Very easy to install, looks great in the garage.\n16#It works. It works, but the wire clamps could be designed better as solid core wires can be tricky to be well held.\n17#Works! Works as needed. I set it up for the top switch flips the light, bottom switch flips the fan.\n18#Okay. Clicked weird and wrong color.\n19#It works great! This fit in a gang box that already had both a three wire (12/3) and two wire (12/2 aluminum) inside the box. I added a 14/2 AWG copper wire to connect to the new ceiling light. I added a ceiling light in the living room and used the ceiling fan switch in the dining area to install this switch to control both. Waaaaaaay better than cutting into the drywall to install a whole separate gang box for one switch. Especially if there is telephone line and kitchen outlet gang boxes in the same wall space. It fit and it works!\n20#Nice Double Switch. This seems like a good device (even though it's made in China). I've had some bad experiences with inexpensive Chinese-made wiring devices, but this double switch is well made. It feels good and it operates well. I like that there are 2 separate Common terminals and a commoning bar. If you want to use this as 2 separate switches with 2 separate hot feeds, you only have to snap off the commoning bar (I've seen double switches which don't have this feature). Nice double switch, and it even includes the cover plate!\n21#New switches. Love my new switches.\n22#Solid feeling, no issues on installation. Seems similar to Lutron, which I usually use. Good construction which no issues after install. Solid feeling switch, so thumbs up. Will report back if there's premature failure...\n23#Stiff paddles. The switch was fairly easy to install, appears to be well made and looks nice (bright white). After installing, both switches work independently and as expected. My only con is that both paddles are stiff and require more pressure to turn off. Not a big issue for me, but may be for a child or someone with limited strength.\n24#it works. lights go on and off\n25#Yes this in my kitchen for the sink light and disposal. This switch was exactly what I needed. I am getting another to separate my ceiling fan and light. Now I just wish they had one to turn my daughters brain on and mouth off.\n26#Two switches, one gang. Fits the bill! If you want to wire two switches to the same gang without adding anything, here you go. I have one of these that's actually three in my bathroom and while it was a pain to wire (fitting all the wires into the same opening) it looks clean and works great",
