Failed within a year. Just broke.\n1#Turn your closet to the next step. Works well in our closet that never had a switch. Only had a pull chain. Glad this product is available.\n2#Awesome and easy. Very easy to install. Does look off to the rear of the switches\n3#Dimmer barely dimmed. Bulbs flickered on low but hardly any dimming. This dimmer would barely dim. I am using standard incandescent 40 watt light bulbs. When I would adjust the dimmer to medium or low, it would flicker terribly. I made sure I followed all the directions properly. I even took it out and reinstalled it just to make sure. No matter what I tried, the dimmer would barely dim, and it would flicker badly.\n4#Works Great and high quality. I have them all over my house. They have a very high quality feel then the ones from Lows and Hdpot.\n5#Great dimmer switch. Easy install. Works perfectly.\n6#Kind cheap. The switch is ok but it feels very low quality. Also it flickers even you turn it all the way up so it's not optimal.\n7#Do not buy! This switch has red and one black wire does not conform to residential wiring, after review and best guess switch exploded. Find something made in USA.\n8#Flickering and buzzing. Installed and had my lights flickering without even adjusting dimmer. The sensitivity switch didn't fix anything. Extremely loud buzzing noise. Bought a dimmer switch from hardware store and my setup worked perfectly. Returned.\n9#Works perfect for me! I’ve had this light switch installed for the last couples weeks and I am very happy with this purchase, especially due to its affordability. I have a very bright LED light in my room, no blinds/curtains and live in a foresty area, so at night when it’s pitch black outside my light feels extremely bright. I wanted to be able to turn it down and found this light switch. My dad installed it in minutes and have had 0 issues. The light comes right on, dims perfectly, and is a nice simple design.\n10#Good, but.... I bought this to replace a dimmer that had a smaller dimmer slide switch that was vertical. We have another one like this with a horizontal slide and it is easier to use. This switch seems nice, has a good price for $13 and lots of good reviews. It has a wheel adjustment on the inside to help adjust the lowest dimmer setting, similar to the previously installed one. I adjusted it per the instructions and it worked upon install, but now there is a second or two delay from clicking the switch on to when the light actually turns on.(video) I'll go back and try to adjust again, so it turns on with the lowest dimmer, but I may need to increase the brightness for this switch to work. It is a fine adjustment to try and have the lowest dimmer setting and where the switch turns the light on. Not sure if it is my adjustment or the switch. Update: It did not at first, but has started to cause flickering in the lights. This did not happen with the prior dimmer switch. Due to the flickering combined with the inability to set a low dimming starting point, I would likely not purchase this again.\n11#Didn’t work. This didn’t work on our light switch. The instructions were also hard to follow and the diagrams were super small. Disappointing\n12#Flickering and Buzzing. I only needed a regular dimmer (not smart) for my hallway light. Unfortunately, this dimmer switch was not good at all. There was a constant buzzing/humming sound coming from it. No matter how much I adjusted the dial, the lights would flicker every now and then. Even if I find a sweet spot, a few minutes later, it will flicker again. Would not recommend.\n13#Cheaply Made and Not Reliable. It just broke through regular use. Physically it's coming apart. It also no longer switches. Worked fine until one day it didn't. It's about 4 years old. This is the kind of product that should never need replacing. This one does.\n14#Easy install and works great. Great product. Highly recommend\n15#Great for the value and yes it works for led. It does dim the led lights and the big toggle is to turn on and off the whole light. Could be dial down or up works for single or three way switches super easy to install but always have a professional do the installation but yes it’s do able .\n16#Dimmer feature does not work. A dimmer switch that does not dim the lights is worthless. This one DOES NOT.\n17#It works. Easy slide and quite\n18#Easy install, exactly what I needed! Perfect brightness control. Good dining options. No noise from the switch. Perfect size and matches white color. Very responsive, no lag. Great value!\n19#It works! Everybody’s happy! I installed it to replace the rotary type of dimmer switch. The rotary type seems quite lousy. I bought four and I had to return three. This type of dimmer switch seems to be more reliable. No more fiddling around with the rotary switch. I hate pushing that switch to turn the light off and on. This one works just like a regular light switch except you can change the amount of light. I’m happy.\n20#Easy to install! This was a breeze to install, had all the pieces needed, and looks great!\n21#Great LED Dimmer. Product Installation Instructions are very easy to understand, the extra thumbwheel dial under the cover to adjust the amount of dimness is something not every dimmer has. LED lights dimmed down considerable without flicker or random turning off. Great product!\n22#Fairly nice switch. I'm giving 4 stars right now because while it's a nice looking switch, the directions aren't very clear & husband is struggling to figure out how to hook it up because it's a 3 way switch. So it arrived on time. Looks like a decent switch but until he gets it hooked up, I'm unable to verify at this time how well it works & how durable it is. I will update once we are actually using it.\n23#Light switch. When installed it failed did not work.\n24#Very poor quality. Great price, but for a reason; after less than a year and very limited use, the on off switch does not work anymore. I guess going for price you get what you pay for. Typically I would not leave a review but this one is a replacement for the same one that failed the same way! I gave up and ordered a Lutron for 3 times as much but I know it won’t fail in 9 months!\n25#Life changer. My boyfriend hated having to turn on/off each individual lamp in our dining room, so I got this bad boy and hooked them up. Now it’s just the flip of a wall switch. Game changer.\n26#I wasn’t expected so good. As I say I was not expecting to be soo good. It wasn’t so hard to install but we are not professional. Brightness is good everything is good for us\n27#Not long lasting. Didn't last a year though breaking, install was easy but it didn't last and now doesn't work.\n28#Construction quality poor. I bought 1 and after few months gap developed that looked bad and possibly dangerous. I bought another that turned up faulty and I returned it. Replaced original with 1 from another brand. This brand seems low quality.\n29#Not durable. Failed relatively quickly. The pivot of the rocker broke on one side causing the switch to ARC internally. Will have to look for a better brand somewhere.\n30#Awesome deal. Great deal for this switch. I love how you can change the brightness of the light by sliding your finger up and down the switch. Very well made and easy to install. Works great.\n31#Easy to install but dimming issues. It took a little bit to match up wires from an existing 3 way standard on off switch to this switch when we recently has a set of 8 can-less 6\" LED ceiling lights installed. But, it was more than reasonable. My only issue has to do with the dimming; mind you the manual *did* describe the little knob for adjusting brightness which did help. However, i still AK experiencing the brightness go from low to high and they slightly less than high brightness. Weird. Tuning the knob did help reduce this, but it did not go away. FYI. Not sure if the LEDs are the problem or because there is another switch which is a standard on/off (and not matching switch)....but yeah. Video is the best I could get it.\n32#Nice switch. This is a very switch.\n33#Twitches when dim. Works ok. But When it’s set to dim , the light flickers. Probably cheaply made.\n34#Works fine. Not much to say as its easy to install and works smoothly and as intended.\n35#Worked well at first, then buzzing noise happened. The buzzing noise occurred after about a month, first it was every now and then, now the noise is there every time. Update: Amazon charged a restocking fee to return this item, which I don’t understand why I was charged for the item that had issue after only a month!\n36#Broken when I opened it. I was looking forward to being able to dim my LED kitchen light that is super bright. I installed the new switch and when I tried to toggle the switch it fell apart. I tried to fix it and made it worse.\n37#Neat look. This dimmer switch has a neat look. I think it was easy to install. My handyman did it in less than 5 mins.\n38#Exactly what I needed, great switch. Exact replacement for what was in the house. Worked well super easy to install\n39#Works and a great alternative if you can go to the store. Wasn't to sure on purchasing this outside the hardware store, but needed it in a pinch and it works and wasn't hard to install Dimmer switch, keep in mind, depends on the bulb. Had some LEDs installed that were dimmable, but it wasn't working properly so we switched the lights out and it works perfectly\n40#Fantastic. Feels solid Great product\n41#Cloudy Bay Dimmer. I am changing my review after searching for the flickering issue. It appears that the led light bulbs also affect the dimmer. I changed the light bulbs and the dimmer works.\n42#Works as designed. Works as intended. Easy install\n43#Ground wire needed. Easy to install and program\n44#Junk, installed four and they all failed within two years. As the title sez, garbage. Replaced them with Leviton.\n45#Great!! Very easy to install\n46#Works great. Works great. Love the dimmer",
