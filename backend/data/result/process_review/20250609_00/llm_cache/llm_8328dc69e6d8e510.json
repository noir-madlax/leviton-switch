I've been buying these for my reptiles' heat lamps for years. Accurate, easy to use, and perfectly priced. I can never have too many of these.\n1#Well, it works for LEDs. I have a reading lamp with a compact fluorescent bulb that sometimes is too bright. This device seemed the obvious solution. Except that it did not dim the bulb. But the lamp now dims perfectly - after I changed the bulb to an LED. I am also concerned about how long it will last. Plugging the lamp into it was very difficult, as if there was some sort of internal misalignment. So I think it will have to spend its life serving only that lamp, as I fear that unplugging it and moving it may cause it to malfunction.\n2#Lutron! How could you ruin a good product? Lutron ruined this device at some point! We have two from many years ago (one finally wore out) that have a red indicator that glows softly at night so you can see the blasted thing on the nightstand. They have REMOVED THE INDICATOR! Not only that, there is just an overall decrease in quality. The detent used to have a smooth feel to it. Now, it's much harder to slide on and off through the detent. Appears to be another case of reducing the cost to manufacture for more profit and charging the same and the customer gets a worse product. I don't know why I'm, even giving it 2 stars. Very sad. I'm returning it and will buy some Chinese brand that has the indicator.\n3#Very Practical Easy to use. Good Product\n4#Works great! Perfect length. I love that the dimmer switch is at the very end of the cord. The cord is quite long. It made a big difference for my sconces. I can now easily reach the on and off/dimmer.\n5#Does not work. Only goes from bright to Off, no dimming at all\n6#Don't Bother. Junk. Used it on LED lamp. It reduced briightness by half, dim slider was erratic, light flicker made the lamp unusable. I tossed the thing in the trash. A waste of $20.00\n7#Easy to set up and use. I bought for all bedroom lamps. So easy to turn off before drifting asleep\n8#Don't waste your money. Got this today 11/5/24 around 8:30pm and plugged it into my 5ft Christmas tree immediately. Well it didn't dim the lights at all. A waste!\n9#Disappointed that it didn't last. I ordered one of these on Nov 28, 2020. I use it to control some under counter led lighting. Worked great till now. Still turns on and off but Rudolf can no longer hit full power. In fact on full, we're maybe at half brightness. I really don't care about the dimmer feature so I'm replacing it with a similar product that just turns things on and off. Very disappointed that it didn't hold up and now I have to spend more money and time making things work again because this product is unreliable.\n10#Perfect. Really great product works on so many things.\n11#Really Cheap Feeling. It works, but feels really cheap. The motion of the control feels like its grinding.\n12#Love it - Perfect for nighttime TV viewing. I like low lights to watch TV at night - this works great!\n13#Great light switch. These are great light switches. I have them in my elderly mother‘s room and buy her chair in the living room. I do not have to worry that she’s going to fall over trying to turn the light off.\n14#Flicker free with LED. Got this to add to a small table lamp my wife uses next to her chair for those winter mornings when she wakes early. The 60W equivalent LED is too bright in those situations, so the Lutron dimmer is perfect to set it to a comfortable level. The lamp has a line switch on it, so my wife leaves the dimmer slide set at her desired brightness and just turns off the line switch. That way the brightness is always the same. The only downside is you have the lamp cord (the clear on in the photo) running TO the outlet, and the dimmer switch cord returning FROM the outlet (one of the black cords in the photo) to where you want to have the slider sitting--which is typically right beside the lamp. Therefore, two cords. But when it's dark, who cares? The MOST IMPORTANT THING: The dimmable LED light bulb does not flicker at any position of the slider.\n15#Causes lights to flicker. When my lights are plugged into this dimmer, the lights begin to flicker, even when the dimmer is at maximum. The product is unusable because of the flickering.\n16#Most of them work very well. Does what it claims. Compact, nicely designed and made. Easy to deploy and use. Two of three work perfectly. The third one works well most of the time.\n17#Lamp dimmer. This device works well\n18#Works well. Bought this to use to dim the wattage on my bearded dragons basking bulb. It works great.\n19#Smooth Dimmer for LED. This dimmer works great for corded lamps using dimmable LED bulbs such as Philips Warm Glow. The dimming function is smooth, with no flickering at any setting from full dim to full bright. The dimmer control sits nicely on your lamp table and features non-slip rubber strips on the bottom to help prevent the control from sliding off your table.\n20#works fine, robust build. Works fine. the one i had lasted was the white version of this, and lasted 5 years. it's a plug-in thing, and all you have to do is plug it into an electrical wall socket type thing and then plug your lamp into the Lutron's socket. this dims fine and i use it on an incandescent GE 'reveal' 75w. bulb, and i normally only have it at half-power, via the slider, and it keeps the bulb under-powered and the bulbs typically have lasted a year.\n21#Would buy again. Kinda spendy but works like it should and if it lasts it will be well worth the money.\n22#Annoying buzzing sound, and terrible flickering. It makes an electric buzzing sound and the nearly seizure inducing flickering make it so annoying when it's turned up to full power. Also there is not much difference from when it's on the lowest setting to when it's on the highest. It's basically a piece of junk.\n23#Works great. Does exactly what it is supposed to do!\n24#Well built. Love these. Wife had one for years on her bedside table and I finally decided I needed one too. Found the exact same model (this one). Solidly built. Positive click when you turn the dimmer fully off. We've experienced no flicking or buzzing and just using normal LED bulbs.\n25#Did not work for us. Wanted this to dim our fake Christmas tree lights. They’re LED and it didn’t really work for us. If it was really low it was ok but once you moved it at all, they flickered. The unit also got quite hot. Sent back.\n26#Doesn't dim led Christmas lights. I bought this because the lights on my Christmas tree are too bright. Didn't know if it would work or not so I took a chance. Works on other lights, so it does what they say. Like I said I took a chance.\n27#Worked perfectly to dim LED Christmas Lights. I bought this on the outside chance it would dim the LED lights on my Christmas tree. They were just too bright believe it or not. I plugged all the lights together and then into this dimmer. Perfect. I can set the brightness anywhere I want.\n28#At the highest setting LED lights are dimmed. LED Christmas lights are dimmed at the highest setting. When I did dim them at some settings the lights flickered.\n29#Don't waste your money. This thing completely failed after only a few months of use. Poor design in that you had to move the slider up to the maximum bright position to turn on the lamp which I do not like. I replaced this with the Leviton TBL03 which lets you turn on the lamp at the lowest dim level without having to go to full brightness first.\n30#Good quality, good price. Good quality, good price\n31#Perfect to balance all lights in a room. I collect antique lamps and some tend to be brighter than others. This dimmer switch is perfect to balance out the lamps in a room. I will probably end up with a houseful of these.\n32#awesome works perfect. turned my non dimmable lamp into a dimmable lamp!\n33#Cheap junk. Didn't dim at all!! Crappy design!! It was either full on or completely off!! No dim in between at all!!\n34#Perfect! Works perfectly!\n35#Outdoor dimmer. Love the product it’s great for dimming string lights too give a different ambiance\n36#Flickers. Very uneven brightness control. Flickers intensely at highest brightness.\n37#very good. Lutron switches are in my opinion are the best light switches and dimmers.\n38#Functional but not durable. Dimmer worked well while it worked. The dimmer switch began making electrical popping sounds and died.\n39#Prone to use error. It was working great but then I needed to move it. Apparently I had the plug reversed but it was still able to make contact and pop! The thing stopped working. My fault for getting the polarity wrong but it seems like an easy trap to fall into.\n40#Works great/Cozy lighting! These dimmers work great! I’ve had this one for probably over a year now and love it. I finally bought one for my husband’s lamp too because when I’m trying to fall asleep before him, it’s so bright. Now that he can put it on the dimmer setting, I have no issues going to bed earlier. It makes the room really cozy when you want darker lighting. Also, I don’t have to reach as far because the switch hangs over my bed which is amazing!\n41#Works great for heat lamp. Needed a dimming switch for a heat lamp and a heat mat and this worked well and I plan to keep using it.\n42#I like how easy this product is to set up and use. I wish the cord was a little longer, and I've seen others with a little tiny light up button to make it easy to see/find, I wish it had that because when you enter that room where your using it, you have to first turn on a light to find the end of the cord control turn it on then go turn off the light you turned on when you entered the room,, I wish it had a timer woukd make it easier?, but the product definatley fits the description and I think it's a great product for the price?\n43#Works great with LEDs. I bought several of these to be able to adjust the brightness of several table lamps. It just works.\n44#Was always very hot when being used. I did not feel comfortable using this product. It worked on our Christmas tree but I was incredibly hot and I did not feel safe using it.\n45#Works great with dimmable LED bulbs. Added this to my standard swing-arm desk lamp containing a dimmable led bulb. Lets me dial in just the right amount of brightness for the need. Very smooth operation. Can also turn the lamp completely off if needed, though I usually use the lamp switch for that. Works great.\n46#Still flickers led bulbs. Avoid if you want to control an led bulb and have it not flicker. This flickers. Really disappointing\n47#Good. Used this to dim a corner lamp with (3) 2.5 watt bulbs. Worked well, got the lights brightness down to a level we were looking for",
