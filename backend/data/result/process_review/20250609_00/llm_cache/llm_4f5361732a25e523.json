Wired it by the way the old switch was wired. The switch works but the light is on all the time. The old unit the light was only on when the switch was on. Looked at the generic diagrams that came with the switch and not were of this variety. The closest was a toggle switch with a light and our wiring matches that diagram. So I just wrote ON and OFF on the wall with a magic marker so folks would know.\n1#Followed directions and it works like it should. Make sure you follow the wiring directions for this switch to illuminate when its turned on, otherwise it can be illuminated all the time. I replaced a similar but older switch with this one and it works great. I know it the light is on in my attic without having to pull down the stairs and it's also a good reminder if I left that light on.\n2#Served My Purpose Well. We have a walk-in closet with an interior ceiling light fixture and an external switch. It was very easy to accidentally leave the light on and the closet door closed and you wouldn‚Äôt know it until after dark when you could faintly see a light leak around the door frame. I replaced the existing light switch with this one and now if the light is on inside a red indicator light is visible outside of the closet. It was an easy swap-out but the new switch required a common wire connection that the original switch did not have. The instructions did not make this clear, so I called the manufacturer and they advised me. Fortunately I had a capped-off common wired in the back of my outlet box that I was able to activate and use. I had to remove the switch and reinstall it but it now works perfectly well. Now whenever the internal light is on, the external red indicator light lets me know. This change did require a new plastic switch plate that I bought at Lowe‚Äôs for less than a dollar.\n3#Handy switch. Switch is great for making sure lights are turned off. The indicator light is a little hard to see in the daylight.\n4#Works as expected! I expect it to live for several lives of forward home owners.\n5#Nice switch. I was looking for a switch that had a light indicator on it. The light is in the garage and would get left on all the time as we couldn't see it once we were in the house. This was perfect.\n6#Just what I needed. Wanted a disconnect with light for my charger when hooked to the grid. This is the ticket.\n7#Leviton Switch. It wa easy to replace my old switch with the new. I did have to connect the neutral which hadn‚Äôt been used on the old switch.\n8#we know when the attic light is on with red light on. we avoid leaving attic lights on with this as glows red when switched on.\n9#good product. Good product now I can see if attic has light on.\n10#Dim pilot light. Quality product but pilot light is really dim. I believe they use a neon light. LEDs would be better.\n11#Switch. Worked out great üëç\n12#OK, but Leviton marketing needs help. I have purchased this switch on two occasions, one online and one from Home Depot. While both perform as advertised they are different as follows. In both cases the instructions included are sub-standard. They can be figured out, but it takes a little time. I've purchased other Leviton products and the wiring diagrams seem to have been done by a draftsman with little or no knowledge of wiring principles or conventions. The switches received function the same but appear to be from different vintages. On one version the signal light is a narrow slit, so dim it is not noticeable from a distance. The one from Home Depot has a brighter, more visible light. The switches have changed but the instruction have not kept up. They perform their intended purpose but were given only three stars because of nebulous instructions. A very minor item is that the switch operates left and right rather than the more conventional up and down. Till you train yourself you find yourself try to operate the switch in the wrong direction.\n13#BUENA CALIDAD. BUENA CLIDAD, PRACTICO.",
