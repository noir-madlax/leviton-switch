    "prompt": "Extract comprehensive customer insights from reviews about WiFi Connected Smart Switches.\nThe output format is JSON in English:\n{\n\"phy\": {\n\"<PHYSICAL>\": {\n\"<PID>@<DETAIL>\": {\n\"<SENT>\": [ID, …]\n}\n}\n},\n\"perf\": {\n\"<PERF>\": {\n\"<perf_id>@<DETAIL>\": {\n\"<SENT>\": {<PERF_REASON>: [ID, …]}\n}\n}\n},\n\"use\": {\n\"<USE>\": {\n\"<SENT>\": {<USE_REASON>: [ID, …]}\n}\n}\n}\n\nDefinitions:\n- <PID>: Unique ID for physical aspect (\"phy\"), starting from A. After Z, continue with AA, AB, and so on.\n- <PHYSICAL>: Components or inherent physical properties of the WiFi Connected Smart Switches without external interaction (e.g. dimensions, appearance, material type...)\n- <DETAIL>: A self-contained detail summarized from the reviews.\n- <SENT>: Sentiment polarity of the current <DETAIL> (- for negative, + for positive).\n- ID: All review IDs mentioning the <DETAIL>\n- <perf_id>: Unique ID for performance or functions (\"perf\"), starting from a. After z, continue with aa, ab, and so on.\n- <PERF>: The WiFi Connected Smart Switches' performance (e.g. flexibility, durability, ...) or behaviors under various conditions (e.g. temperature, force, chemicals...) without reference to any specific use case\n- <PERF_REASON>: <PID> of the <PHYSICAL> explicitly mentioned as the cause of the <PERF>. Include all mentioned <PID>s. If no reason is mentioned, use \"?\". <PERF_REASON> and <PERF> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together (i.e. the same review ID are included at both locations)\n- <USE>: The specific application, applicable object, method, tool, or environment for the product.\n- <USE_REASON>: <perf_id> or <PID> causing the <USE>'s sentiment. Include all mentioned reasons, or \"?\" if none can be inferred. <USE_REASON> and <USE> should have the same sentiment polarity in the review where they are mentioned together.\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- <PHYSICAL>/<PERF> and <DETAIL> MUST NOT include:\n  * Generic statements without details (e.g., \"good\", \"bad quality\")\n  * Issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., \"fast shipping\", \"delivery time\")\n- If a review mentions any physical aspect, related performance, or use together, extract them as separate entries under \"phy,\" \"perf,\" and \"use,\" with no overlap.\n- Make sure each <DETAIL> is under the most relevant <PHYSICAL> or <PERF> in the context of WiFi Connected Smart Switches\n- Preserve negations\n\nKey Instructions:\n- Break down reviews with multiple aspects, performances, or uses into individual entries.\n- Escape special characters with backslash that could cause JSON syntax errors.\n- Include only explicitly mentioned reasons, and use \"?\" where no reason is mentioned.\n\nFinal Checklist:\n- Go through all reviews and ensure that no aspect, performance, use, or reason is omitted, even if only mentioned once.\n- Review all entries to ensure proper separation between aspects, performances, and uses.\n\nPrint the JSON result only.\nInput format:\n<ID>#<review>\n\n[[INPUT]]\n0#Good product will purchase again. Work great easy to use.\n1#No cumplió mis expectativas. Todo bien, pero se suponía serían 4 switches por separado, y lo son, pero la tapa de afuera vienen todos juntos, cómo se supone que voy a poner la tapa junta\n2#FALLA EN EL PRODUCTO. Los interruptores a pesar de conectarse con polo a tierra y con las instrucciones del manual, no lograron algunos conectarse al sistema wifi y otros no prendian ni apagaban el foco.\n3#Smart Device. Inexpensive and simple way to start building a smart home. Wiring is straight forward and at the end you can link and control and automate your lights switches via the Google Home and/or Alexa, which connect to the Android app \"Smart Life\"\n4#Good product & excellent service ! Great product & easy to install. Fast shipment. Good value for money. Excellent response time on questions with quick resolutions.\n5#No compres. Esto es una basura, todo el día dice que no tiene conexión a internet ya me tiene cansado tengo 3 Wifi en la casa de 5 y de 2.4 y ninguno funciona correctamente no gasten su dinero\n6#Nice switch and ez app. These are nice switches, I bought and installed 8 of them. The app was simple and I've integrated them with alexa. 3rd party alexa compatible devices are actually better than Amazon Alexa devices for household members. I'm amazed Amazon alexa devices can only be set up on one userers Alexa app, how short sighted is that! When 3rd party Alexa compatible devices with their own app can be easily integrated into unlimited number of alexa users. So using these 3rd party alexa compatible switches both me and my wife can access these switches through our own alexa apps. It drives me nuts that my wife can't control our Amazon thermostats from her phone for either of our homes because they are setup on my Alexa app. Had I known this first I would have bought 3rd party thermostats, and probably will replace them for this reason.\n7#Interruptor inteligente,me parece excelente que los enviaran con la tapa individual. Son muy prácticos, son fáciles de conectar a smart life, pero la tapa no debería ser para los 4,tomas deberían ser independiente para cada toma, en estos pack\n8#Great Product. The ynf light switch is an awesome addition to my smart home devices. Works with Alexa, appreciate the fact it works with the app Smart Life, so I didn't have to download any more apps for my smart home. Easy to pair and name as you wish\n9#Excellent single pole. It pairs up fast, and it works. However, the included connectors need to be improved to the quality of the device. It is better not to include the inferior connectors!\n10#Works well, easy to install. It was easy to install, I did 3 in about an hour. I'm not an electrician, so I was probably pretty slow. Directions were easy to follow. I had the smart home app from other devices, so it was easy to connect them to wifi. They automatically connected to the Alexa. Now I just have to figure out where I am going to put the fourth one.",
