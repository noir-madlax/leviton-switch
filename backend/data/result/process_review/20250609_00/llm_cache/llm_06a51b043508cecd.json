Don't recommend. They won't last more than 6months and will need to be replaced and don't even match the white plates. I buy alot of stuff on Amazon but this is not worth the money you will save.\n1#don't buy this brand switch with out wall plate from the same brand. color not a match with different brand white wall plates. looks like off white color.\n2#The product. I love this for my daughter room very cute\n3#Less than half Dep and Lows price with same day delivery. And I didn't have to drive to the store. Cool\n4#1 bad out of 3 installed so far. So far 1 bad switch out of 3 installed. Will update as we go\n5#I liked this product. These light switches work very well.\n6#Good for switching from toggle to paddle switch. Switches are fine, especially for switching out old toggle switches. But those holes on the back don't work for hooking them up. You have to do it the old fashion wash.\n7#Color. These are more of an off white and do not match the white switch plates\n8#Not gloss white. I had electrician install these and after the installation I noticed it was ivorish color. It says gloss white, but it is more like gloss ivory. Not recommend, people who tries to match colors with your gloss white plate.\n9#Polycarbonate cracks on 30% within 2 years. I bought 30 of these to replace all the light switches in our new house to paddle switches. In the last 6 months, cracks are starting to develop in the paddles. So far we have replaced 10 of them. Made in China low quality polycarbonate.\n10#It’s not white! Make sure you are ok with this off-white color before buying\n11#2 out of first 3 switches defective. First switch doesn't stay when switched. The other switch stays 9 out of 10 times. Junk.\n12#Low quality. Cheap plastic. Low price. Low quality. Cheap plastic.\n13#Awesome Product. I like this product as it is lightweight and well built. It does not take too much space in the electrical box making it easier to manage the wires. Highly recommend it\n14#Basic but utilitarian. These are not fancy...I mean they're just switches...but they are built well and priced right\n15#Quality problem. Few switches has a big gap at the top of the switch. You can't see it unless you push the button of the switch.\n16#Excellent. I work remodeling houses and I always use these. They are very good and they are at a very good price.\n17#lood good. Easy install and a good price.\n18#Great Product for Low Price. Thought I only needed 15, I ended up ordering this 20 pack as it was less expensive than ordering a 10 pack then 5 individuals. Though these were not the Leviton brand-name ones, they look identical and have a very satisfying click. Very easy to install, high quality.\n19#Works great. We flip houses and use these a lot great quality and price\n20#As described. As described\n21#Buenísimo. Buenísimo en calidad y precio\n22#Rápido. Con calidad\n23#Works well! Brought these to replace some switch. Works well so far will purchase again.\n24#Color is wrong. Does not match with plates. The color of the light switch does not match the color of the plate they’re both supposed to be gloss white and the color is obviously not the same and stands out very aggressively. I had to redo the entire job and buy things from Home Depot where I should’ve bought them to begin with I never would’ve had to deal with this cheap Chinese stuff\n25#switches break. Tab breaks off switch cover goes flying across the room hits dog, dog flies across room causing Giant ruckus! It only hit the Daisy the first time one of them broke. 5 have broken so far, don't think the other 15 will last the rest of the year. 1 star because they work and look nice.\n26#Aweful ground. The switch is fairly unremarkable. But the ground terminal is rather hard to work with than others. I bought 4 boxes to try them out. I think I'll return 3.\n27#Best Price. Doing a remodel and found this package deal, wasn't impressed with the quality but don't have children or many people at the house so I expect them to hold up, time will tell. Just wish they were sturdier but can't beat the price on these.\n28#Just feew weeks and light is not working anymore. We installed it and a one week the light doesn’t work any longer. Asked Amazon to have it replaced since it has 1 year warranty. The seller agreed to replaced 3 since out 20 that we bought. But until now the seller ignored to replaced them.\n29#Great quality. Found quality in these, easy to use and looks very good. I will buy some more in a few months.\n30#Red flags. This thing Burned-out right after I installed. Almost injured my family. Stay away from this cheap products",
