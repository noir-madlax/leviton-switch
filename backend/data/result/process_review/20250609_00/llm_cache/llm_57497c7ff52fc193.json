Was setting up hue lights for client's kitchen, I have like 30+ hue lights at home so I have a bridge. The clients don't really care about the bridge they just wanted good lights so I was trying to pair the lights with the remote only. I got this v2 one because it specifically said it will work. At first try I couldn't get it to work because I was using the app to pair it. On the instruction it actually has the section showing how to pair without bridge and you just pair it by placing the remote close to the lightstrip or bulb and hold the button it will pair and work. Love it.\n1#Nice switch/control addition to Philips Hue. Easy to connect to Philips Hue app. And since it’s a stick on plate, it’s also a convenient and easy install for wherever/however you need.\n2#Easy connectivity and customizability. It's a light switch. It switches lights. A+ Easy to connect and customize, with near-infinite variations if for some reason you need to switch frequently between 1000 Lumens and 5 Lumens.\n3#Amazing Product but will need Philips Bridge. Amazing product. Highly recommend. You will need to have a Philips bridge in order to pair the device with multiple bulbs. But works great and dims perfectly.\n4#Works great. Great remote when using hue.\n5#Good Job. The switch came fast and worked.\n6#Doesn’t work. Impossible to get this to sync with my hue bridge\n7#Opened box. Item sold as new by VanMark Deals, but was delivered in a torn opened box. The \"new package design\" sticker is suspicious as well. The item does work as expected.\n8#These work great. These work awesome for bedrooms especially\n9#Works Fine. The Philips Hue dimmer switch works fine.\n10#So this is supposed to do what? I bought this thinking it was supposed to help resolve flickering issues with my overhead ceiling fan lights, but it has done little to resolve that. Maybe I just don't understand how it is supposed to work, but I'm not seeing the benefit.\n11#Philips Hue. Love the dimmer switch, have multiple dimmer switches through the house. It’s nice being able to cycle through scenes and customize lights and be able to just toggle through them without having to open app .\n12#Love these. Whenever I have guests over, they're always impressed by these switches. Plus if guests are staying over, it lets them have control over the light switch even if they don't have the Hue app installed.\n13#Replacement controller. It exceeded my expectations.\n14#The best smart remote to use with Philips hue lights. I’ve already bought 2 earlier versions of this device. It seems well-made, the battery lasts a very long time (upwards of a year), and I love that you can create automations to turn lights on and off in different parts of my house with the click of a button. It is very easy to set up, both in the HUE app as well as HomeKit.\n15#I've got the remote, but where are the bulbs. I've got the remote, but where are the bulbs\n16#Always works. I have tried other switches and buttons for my smart home but these work the best and the batteries last a very long time.\n17#Easy to use. Great product that’s easy to use with our other Phillips products\n18#Hardware okay, seller aweful. Hardware okay, seller aweful\n19#Easy to set up, convenient. Was very easy to set up and install. The wall mount has the option to screw it into the wall but I opted to just use the 3M adhesive that comes on the back of the wall mount. I put it on the wall just above the actual light switches. The remote sticks to the mount via magnets. The magnets are the perfect strength, they hold the remote firmly in place but yet it is easy to pop the remote off the wall to keep on a nightstand etc. Setup in the app was easy and you can really customize what you want each button to do. My only complaint is that when I first walk into the room I have to hit the buttons a few times before they work. I’m guessing this is because the remote is in some kind of standby mode when not in use? I’m hooked up to a bridge on 1 gig high speed business internet at the house so I don’t think it’s a connectivity issue on my end. Despite this minor flaw I’m very happy I purchased this remote so I don’t have to fumble around with my phone every time I walk into a room. Will probably get hue bulbs + one of these switches in every room eventually\n20#Works well with the SONOFF Zigbee Dongle. This works like a breeze with the SONOFF Zigbee Dongle if you want to use it in HomeAssistant or just rolling your own server code.\n21#Well made and convenient. I have a standing lamp by my bed so I use the switch to turn it off when I am lying down. This little device is so slim and I never have operational problems with it. It dims nicely and there are different light tones you can select. Have had it for years.\n22#Works like a dream. I have had the old one and the new is fantastic, works perfectly. Hooks up to Amazon in no time. Great value for the money, would recommend!\n23#Needs usability improvements. I wanted to like this dimmer, but after having it a few weeks - I don't, and will be going back to a regular switch. The problem is; you have to look at it and aim for the button at the top - in a dark room... My wife and I keep knocking it off the wall, because we're used to just having a simple switch... I mostly just want to turn on or off the light; rarely do I need to dim it, or change \"scenes\", and when I do - it can be done in the app. A better design, would be a large ON/OFF toggle with a very small dim slider or knob off to the side. Basically, this design puts features before usability. I won't buy any more until they address this.\n24#Hace su trabajo. Sin problema, hace lo que se supone debe hacer.\n25#No instructions the QR takes you to web that does not tell you how to setup the switc h. Phillip Hue is doesn't care about customers. No instructions provided.\n26#Not as good as V1. I really hate that they changed the on position of the buttons between V1 and V2, so that you have a few in your house, you have to know if you hit the top or the bottom button to turn it on. Also the magnet holding it to the housing is not as good as it was in V1. At least once a week I knock it off the wall. Buy the V1...cheaper and better\n27#Original was better. I don't like the new design. The original buttons was better. But it works fine\n28#Works great. Nice to have a switch in the wall to use the lights instead of having to grab my phone. Can be used as a remote too, which is great to put out the lights once in bed without needing to use my phone.\n29#Essential is you use smart bulbs. I like how easy it is to pair and setup the remote. The app will give some reasonable defaults and ask you a few questions as to which bulbs it controls. Once done, the remote works every time. If you have a smart bulb in a lamp or something, it's essential to have a manual control. If I need to turn a lamp on in the bedroom at night, I don't want to use a voice assistant or fumble with an app. You can configure the press and hold to turn off all lights in the house. I would prefer if this could be configured to turn off all lights in the room.\n30#Installation easy. Installed to Phillips Bridge and then to bogie home... easy, just like all the light bulbs\n31#As Advertised. As Advertised\n32#Perfect for less tech-enthused household members. My gf had a love/hate relationship with the Philips Hue lights I put in her home. She loved all the scenes she could choose from, but she hated pulling out her phone to turn on lights when she came home. I got her this as a gift and she 100% loves her Hue lights again. You set this up with 5 different scenes, which are accessible by tapping the button once for each scene option.\n33#Lots to like. Seems to work very well. Like other Hue switches this one fools visitors but great for everyday family use. Tap Switch is better because it does not require a battery but being able to easily dim lights is a massive plus.\n34#Big fan. This new Hue dimmer looks awesome and works great. As with anything Hue related, it pairs easy and shows up in the Hue app as well and Apple Homekit. I love the fact that the on/off is now one button and you can change the scene with the bottom one as well as dim or Brighton with the center rocker. Overall great product.\n35#Can't even install it. I thought this would be a nice upgrade to my v1 switch, which doesn't work well with Homekit where supposedly this one does... however, this one doesn't even install. I followed the instructions of pressing the Power button for 3 seconds, if that doesn't work open the back and press the Setup for 2 seconds, if that doesn't work press Setup for 10 seconds.... etc. etc. Nothing works. I think the switch might be fine and it's just the completely useless Hue app that is the problem, as I do see the switch's blinking lights turn green.... but ultimately this is a complete waste of time and money. The fact that the app says \"Need help? Visit philips-hue.com/support\" and the site sends you to some completely pointless random marketing site about how wonderful Philips is, while offering absolutely 0 support, speaks volumes :( Ultimately, this switch is useless trash. I'll look elsewhere, and I'll migrate away from the Philips Hue system if this is what passes as quality product from them now after their strong initial offerings in home automation.\n36#Lights on/off on schedule. Easy installation and confidence knowing the lights go on/off as scheduled\n37#Smart Bridge Required. Requires a smart bridge to work, but it works.\n38#Perfect for my room with no light switches. I have a rental that had two rooms with a ceiling fan that had a pull string for lights. We removed the fan and did not want to put in another fan/light. Only problem was the room doesn't have a light switch for the ceiling wiring. This worked out perfectly. I screwed one Phillips Hue bulb, held the power button on the switch a few seconds until the bulb blinked to pair. Then repeated the process for a second hue bulb. Now the room has a on/off switch and the bulbs even dim. I didn't have to download any app or any of that non sense. Very happy that I didn't have to get a electrician to break my walls to run a wire for me.\n39#They changed the buttons. It works well and I recommend it if you are buying for the first time. But if you have Gen 1 version around your house, be warned that they changed the bottom button from Off to Hue. That means I have a mix matched version of these around the house and some I have to hit the bottom button to turn it off and some I have to hit to top button. Doesn't sound like a big deal but it is as I end up dimming lights on the new ones.\n40#A must. Makes using smart lights pretty much the only option. Thanks for this. My only wish was if we can program the hue button to go into hue sync mode. Thats the only thing i still have to go to the app to start up. But overall this is worth every penny\n41#Better than the last model! Integrated into the environment I have set up very well and easy to learn how it works. better than the older unit!\n42#excelente control. muy moderno y facil de usar y instalar versatil a mi esposa le facina definitivo facil control .\n43#So frustrating. I didn’t realize the switch had changed. I have a house full of the v1 and now they’ve changed. I wouldn't care about the aesthetic changes if I could program it to use the bottom button as an off switch. Who could have thought this was a good idea? Did someone think they would incentivize people to replace all their v1 switches because they were so frustrated by having different types? It incentivizes me not to buy the bulbs or switches for the other rooms I was going to do. As it is, the lights keep getting left on so it’s not helpful. To add insult to injury, I figured I would swap this one with one in a room my wife never uses but they shape is not compatible. So I’d have to try to move it without damaging the wall and get it to re-stick.\n44#Awesome gadget to have. Pricy for sure but often when we get home and don’t want to say “echo turn on the lights” after a long day at work, pressing this button works perfectly.",
