Was very easy to set up and install. The wall mount has the option to screw it into the wall but I opted to just use the 3M adhesive that comes on the back of the wall mount. I put it on the wall just above the actual light switches. The remote sticks to the mount via magnets. The magnets are the perfect strength, they hold the remote firmly in place but yet it is easy to pop the remote off the wall to keep on a nightstand etc. Setup in the app was easy and you can really customize what you want each button to do. My only complaint is that when I first walk into the room I have to hit the buttons a few times before they work. I’m guessing this is because the remote is in some kind of standby mode when not in use? I’m hooked up to a bridge on 1 gig high speed business internet at the house so I don’t think it’s a connectivity issue on my end. Despite this minor flaw I’m very happy I purchased this remote so I don’t have to fumble around with my phone every time I walk into a room. Will probably get hue bulbs + one of these switches in every room eventually\n1#Works well with the SONOFF Zigbee Dongle. This works like a breeze with the SONOFF Zigbee Dongle if you want to use it in HomeAssistant or just rolling your own server code.\n2#Well made and convenient. I have a standing lamp by my bed so I use the switch to turn it off when I am lying down. This little device is so slim and I never have operational problems with it. It dims nicely and there are different light tones you can select. Have had it for years.\n3#Works like a dream. I have had the old one and the new is fantastic, works perfectly. Hooks up to Amazon in no time. Great value for the money, would recommend!\n4#Needs usability improvements. I wanted to like this dimmer, but after having it a few weeks - I don't, and will be going back to a regular switch. The problem is; you have to look at it and aim for the button at the top - in a dark room... My wife and I keep knocking it off the wall, because we're used to just having a simple switch... I mostly just want to turn on or off the light; rarely do I need to dim it, or change \"scenes\", and when I do - it can be done in the app. A better design, would be a large ON/OFF toggle with a very small dim slider or knob off to the side. Basically, this design puts features before usability. I won't buy any more until they address this.\n5#Hace su trabajo. Sin problema, hace lo que se supone debe hacer.\n6#No instructions the QR takes you to web that does not tell you how to setup the switc h. Phillip Hue is doesn't care about customers. No instructions provided.\n7#Not as good as V1. I really hate that they changed the on position of the buttons between V1 and V2, so that you have a few in your house, you have to know if you hit the top or the bottom button to turn it on. Also the magnet holding it to the housing is not as good as it was in V1. At least once a week I knock it off the wall. Buy the V1...cheaper and better\n8#Original was better. I don't like the new design. The original buttons was better. But it works fine\n9#Works great. Nice to have a switch in the wall to use the lights instead of having to grab my phone. Can be used as a remote too, which is great to put out the lights once in bed without needing to use my phone.\n10#Essential is you use smart bulbs. I like how easy it is to pair and setup the remote. The app will give some reasonable defaults and ask you a few questions as to which bulbs it controls. Once done, the remote works every time. If you have a smart bulb in a lamp or something, it's essential to have a manual control. If I need to turn a lamp on in the bedroom at night, I don't want to use a voice assistant or fumble with an app. You can configure the press and hold to turn off all lights in the house. I would prefer if this could be configured to turn off all lights in the room.",
