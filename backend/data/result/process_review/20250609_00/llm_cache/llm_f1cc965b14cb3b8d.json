Installed to Phillips Bridge and then to bogie home... easy, just like all the light bulbs\n1#As Advertised. As Advertised\n2#Perfect for less tech-enthused household members. My gf had a love/hate relationship with the Philips Hue lights I put in her home. She loved all the scenes she could choose from, but she hated pulling out her phone to turn on lights when she came home. I got her this as a gift and she 100% loves her Hue lights again. You set this up with 5 different scenes, which are accessible by tapping the button once for each scene option.\n3#Lots to like. Seems to work very well. Like other Hue switches this one fools visitors but great for everyday family use. Tap Switch is better because it does not require a battery but being able to easily dim lights is a massive plus.\n4#Big fan. This new Hue dimmer looks awesome and works great. As with anything Hue related, it pairs easy and shows up in the Hue app as well and Apple Homekit. I love the fact that the on/off is now one button and you can change the scene with the bottom one as well as dim or Brighton with the center rocker. Overall great product.\n5#Can't even install it. I thought this would be a nice upgrade to my v1 switch, which doesn't work well with Homekit where supposedly this one does... however, this one doesn't even install. I followed the instructions of pressing the Power button for 3 seconds, if that doesn't work open the back and press the Setup for 2 seconds, if that doesn't work press Setup for 10 seconds.... etc. etc. Nothing works. I think the switch might be fine and it's just the completely useless Hue app that is the problem, as I do see the switch's blinking lights turn green.... but ultimately this is a complete waste of time and money. The fact that the app says \"Need help? Visit philips-hue.com/support\" and the site sends you to some completely pointless random marketing site about how wonderful Philips is, while offering absolutely 0 support, speaks volumes :( Ultimately, this switch is useless trash. I'll look elsewhere, and I'll migrate away from the Philips Hue system if this is what passes as quality product from them now after their strong initial offerings in home automation.\n6#Lights on/off on schedule. Easy installation and confidence knowing the lights go on/off as scheduled\n7#Smart Bridge Required. Requires a smart bridge to work, but it works.\n8#Perfect for my room with no light switches. I have a rental that had two rooms with a ceiling fan that had a pull string for lights. We removed the fan and did not want to put in another fan/light. Only problem was the room doesn't have a light switch for the ceiling wiring. This worked out perfectly. I screwed one Phillips Hue bulb, held the power button on the switch a few seconds until the bulb blinked to pair. Then repeated the process for a second hue bulb. Now the room has a on/off switch and the bulbs even dim. I didn't have to download any app or any of that non sense. Very happy that I didn't have to get a electrician to break my walls to run a wire for me.\n9#They changed the buttons. It works well and I recommend it if you are buying for the first time. But if you have Gen 1 version around your house, be warned that they changed the bottom button from Off to Hue. That means I have a mix matched version of these around the house and some I have to hit the bottom button to turn it off and some I have to hit to top button. Doesn't sound like a big deal but it is as I end up dimming lights on the new ones.\n10#A must. Makes using smart lights pretty much the only option. Thanks for this. My only wish was if we can program the hue button to go into hue sync mode. Thats the only thing i still have to go to the app to start up. But overall this is worth every penny\n11#Better than the last model! Integrated into the environment I have set up very well and easy to learn how it works. better than the older unit!",
