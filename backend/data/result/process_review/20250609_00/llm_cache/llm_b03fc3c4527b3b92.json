Was setting up hue lights for client's kitchen, I have like 30+ hue lights at home so I have a bridge. The clients don't really care about the bridge they just wanted good lights so I was trying to pair the lights with the remote only. I got this v2 one because it specifically said it will work. At first try I couldn't get it to work because I was using the app to pair it. On the instruction it actually has the section showing how to pair without bridge and you just pair it by placing the remote close to the lightstrip or bulb and hold the button it will pair and work. Love it.\n1#Nice switch/control addition to Philips Hue. Easy to connect to Philips Hue app. And since it’s a stick on plate, it’s also a convenient and easy install for wherever/however you need.\n2#Easy connectivity and customizability. It's a light switch. It switches lights. A+ Easy to connect and customize, with near-infinite variations if for some reason you need to switch frequently between 1000 Lumens and 5 Lumens.\n3#Amazing Product but will need Philips Bridge. Amazing product. Highly recommend. You will need to have a Philips bridge in order to pair the device with multiple bulbs. But works great and dims perfectly.\n4#Works great. Great remote when using hue.\n5#Good Job. The switch came fast and worked.\n6#Doesn’t work. Impossible to get this to sync with my hue bridge\n7#Opened box. Item sold as new by VanMark Deals, but was delivered in a torn opened box. The \"new package design\" sticker is suspicious as well. The item does work as expected.\n8#These work great. These work awesome for bedrooms especially\n9#Works Fine. The Philips Hue dimmer switch works fine.\n10#So this is supposed to do what? I bought this thinking it was supposed to help resolve flickering issues with my overhead ceiling fan lights, but it has done little to resolve that. Maybe I just don't understand how it is supposed to work, but I'm not seeing the benefit.\n11#Philips Hue. Love the dimmer switch, have multiple dimmer switches through the house. It’s nice being able to cycle through scenes and customize lights and be able to just toggle through them without having to open app .\n12#Love these. Whenever I have guests over, they're always impressed by these switches. Plus if guests are staying over, it lets them have control over the light switch even if they don't have the Hue app installed.\n13#Replacement controller. It exceeded my expectations.\n14#The best smart remote to use with Philips hue lights. I’ve already bought 2 earlier versions of this device. It seems well-made, the battery lasts a very long time (upwards of a year), and I love that you can create automations to turn lights on and off in different parts of my house with the click of a button. It is very easy to set up, both in the HUE app as well as HomeKit.\n15#I've got the remote, but where are the bulbs. I've got the remote, but where are the bulbs\n16#Always works. I have tried other switches and buttons for my smart home but these work the best and the batteries last a very long time.\n17#Easy to use. Great product that’s easy to use with our other Phillips products\n18#Hardware okay, seller aweful. Hardware okay, seller aweful",
