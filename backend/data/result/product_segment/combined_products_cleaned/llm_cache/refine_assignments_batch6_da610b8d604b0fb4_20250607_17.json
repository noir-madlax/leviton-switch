  "prompt": "You are a product taxonomy refinement specialist.\n\n**YOUR TASK:** Review product assignments across all subcategories and reassign products to subcategories that match STRICTLY BETTER than their current assignment.\n\n**INPUT FORMAT:**\nYou will see:\n1. **SUBCATEGORIES** with IDs (S_0, S_1, S_2, etc.) and their definitions\n2. **PRODUCTS** with IDs (P_0, P_1, P_2, etc.) and their current subcategory assignments after → (with format <subcategory_id> (<subcategory name>))\n\n**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**\nReturn **pure JSON only** (no explanations, no markdown, no code blocks):\n- **Only include products that need reassignment**\n- **If no products need reassignment, return empty JSON: {}**\n\nExamples:\n{{\n  \"P_1\": \"S_2\",\n  \"P_5\": \"S_0\"\n}}\n\nOR if no products need reassignment:\n{{}}\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n1. **Selective Output**: Only include product IDs that need reassignment to a different subcategory\n2. **Empty JSON Allowed**: If no products need reassignment, return {{}}\n3. **Format**: Pure JSON object mapping only the product IDs that need changes to their new subcategory IDs\n4. **Conservative Reassignment**: Only reassign a product if another subcategory is STRICTLY BETTER match than the current one\n5. **Keep Most Assignments**: Most products should stay in their current subcategories - only move products that clearly belong elsewhere\n6. **ID Accuracy**: Use only the exact IDs provided - never invent or modify them\n7. **Strict Matching**: A \"strictly better\" match means the product clearly and obviously fits the definition and examples of another subcategory better than its current one\n\n**REASSIGNMENT STRATEGY:**\n- Carefully read each subcategory definition and examples\n- For each product, consider if it fits better in a different subcategory than its current assignment\n- Only reassign if the match is significantly and clearly better\n- When uncertain, keep the product in its current subcategory\n- Focus on obvious mismatches where a product clearly belongs in a different specific subcategory\n- Maintain mutual exclusivity - each product belongs to exactly one subcategory\n\n**SUBCATEGORIES:**\n[S_0] Smart Wi-Fi Enabled Dimmer Switches: Dimmer switches with built-in Wi-Fi connectivity for direct wireless control and smart home integration without requiring
