each product can only belong to ONE subcategory with clear boundaries\n6. **OUT_OF_SCOPE Usage**: Use this special category for products that aren't even remotely related to \"Dimmer Switches\" - use \"OUT_OF_SCOPE\" as the last resort\n7. **Categorization Basis**: Group similar products within \"Dimmer Switches\" by their key distinguishing features based on functionality or features\n\n**Category Quality:**\n8. **Consistent Granularity**: All subcategories must be at the same level of specificity - avoid mixing broad categories with narrow ones\n9. **Precise Terminology**: Use precise, specific terms - avoid generic words like \"specialty\", \"miscellaneous\", \"other\"\n10. **Category Atomicity**: Avoid conjunctions and compound categories - create separate distinct categories instead\n\n[0] Diva LED plus Dimmer Switch for Dimmable LED Bulbs, 150-Watt/Single-Pole or 3-Way, White (DVCL-153P-6-WH) (6-Pack)\n[1] Decora 15 Amp Single Pole Dual Switch, White 5634-WS\n[2] Decora 15 Amp Single-Pole AC Quiet Switch, Light Almond (10-Pack) 5601-2TM\n[3] 2PCS LED Strip Dimmer Switch, USB Female to Male Extension Cord with Dimmable Rotary Switch\n[4] Caseta Wallplate Bracket for Pico Remote (PICO-WBX-ADAPT)\n[5] Rotating Dimmer Switch, Soldering Iron Temperature Control, Electric Fan、Factory Electric Fan, Ventilation Fan, Power Controller, Desk Lamp, Dimming LED Light, UL Listed, White, Below 200W, Pack of 1.\n[6] Philips Hue Smart Dimmer Switch with Remote, White -
