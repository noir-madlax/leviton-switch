taxonomy with categories A_0, A_1, A_2, etc.\n- Taxonomy B is a new batch taxonomy with categories B_0, B_1, B_2, etc.\n- Each category ID represents a specific product category with its own definition\n- Your goal is to consolidate these by grouping similar categories while maintaining their distinctiveness\n\n**CONSOLIDATION INSTRUCTIONS:**\n1. **Identify similar categories** - Group categories from both taxonomies that represent the same or very similar product types based on their definitions\n2. **Preserve specificity** - When consolidating, maintain the specific nature of each category type rather than creating broader, more generic categories\n3. **Create precise names** - Use clear, descriptive names (words separated by spaces) for consolidated categories; each category must represent a SINGULAR, SPECIFIC concept with NO OVERLAP; RENAME categories when needed to make them more distinguishing and specific than the originals\n4. **Include all category IDs** - Each consolidated category contains ALL the original category IDs that belong to the same concept\n5. **Write focused definitions** - Create a precise definition for each consolidated category that clearly describes the specific product type, ending with \"e.g.\" and specific product subtypes (NEVER include brand names, model numbers, or proprietary product line names)\n6. **Ensure completeness** - Every A_* and B_* ID must appear exactly once in the result\n7. **Maintain consistent granularity** - All consolidated categories must be at the same level of specificity\n8. **Ensure mutual exclusivity** - Categories must have clear, non-overlapping boundaries\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n- **Completeness**: Every original category ID must be included exactly once in the \"ids\" arrays\n- **Format**: Return pure JSON only - no explanations or formatting\n- **Consolidation**: Group only categories that represent essentially the same product type - do not force unrelated categories together\n- **Specificity**: Maintain the specific nature of product categories - avoid creating overly broad or generic groupings\n- **Naming**: Use professional, descriptive category names with words separated by spaces; each category must represent ONE specific concept with clear boundaries; IMPROVE original names to be more distinguishing and specific when consolidating\n- **Granularity**: Maintain consistent level of specificity across all consolidated categories\n- **Exclusivity**: Ensure categories are mutually exclusive with no overlap\n- **Definitions**: Each consolidated category must have a \"definition\" field with precise description ending with \"e.g.\" and product subtypes\n\n**EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:**\n{\n  \"Consolidated Category Name 1\": {\n    \"definition\": \"..., e.g. ...\",\n    \"ids\": [\"A_0\", \"B_1\"]\n  },\n  \"Consolidated Category Name 2\": {\n    \"definition\": \"..., e.g. ...\",\n    \"ids\": [\"A_1\"]\n  },\n  \"Consolidated Category Name 3\": {\n
