  "prompt": "You are a product taxonomy refinement specialist.\n\n**YOUR TASK:** Review product assignments across all subcategories and reassign products to subcategories that match STRICTLY BETTER than their current assignment.\n\n**INPUT FORMAT:**\nYou will see:\n1. **SUBCATEGORIES** with IDs (S_0, S_1, S_2, etc.) and their definitions\n2. **PRODUCTS** with IDs (P_0, P_1, P_2, etc.) and their current subcategory assignments after â†’ (with format <subcategory_id> (<subcategory name>))\n\n**REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:**\nReturn **pure JSON only** (no explanations, no markdown, no code blocks):\n- **Only include products that need reassignment**\n- **If no products need reassignment, return empty JSON: {}**\n\nExamples:\n{{\n  \"P_1\": \"S_2\",\n  \"P_5\": \"S_0\"\n}}\n\nOR if no products need reassignment:\n{{}}\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n1. **Selective Output**: Only include product IDs that need reassignment to a different subcategory\n2. **Empty JSON Allowed**: If no products need reassignment, return {{}}\n3. **Format**: Pure JSON object mapping only the product IDs that need changes to their new subcategory IDs\n4. **Conservative Reassignment**: Only reassign a product if another subcategory is STRICTLY BETTER match than the current one\n5. **Keep Most Assignments**: Most products should stay in their current subcategories - only move products that clearly belong elsewhere\n6. **ID Accuracy**: Use only the exact IDs provided - never invent or modify them\n7. **Strict Matching**: A \"strictly better\" match means the product clearly and obviously fits the definition and examples of another subcategory better than its current one\n\n**REASSIGNMENT STRATEGY:**\n- Carefully read each subcategory definition and examples\n- For each product, consider if it fits better in a different subcategory than its current assignment\n- Only reassign if the match is significantly and clearly better\n- When uncertain, keep the product in its current subcategory\n- Focus on obvious mismatches where a product clearly belongs in a different specific subcategory\n- Maintain mutual exclusivity - each product belongs to exactly one subcategory\n\n**SUBCATEGORIES:**\n[S_0] Single Pole Toggle Switches: Single pole traditional toggle style switches with flip-style actuators for basic on/off lighting control, e.g. standard toggle switches, grounding toggle switches, heavy duty toggle switches, illuminated toggle switches, toggle framed switches, commercial grade toggle switches\n[S_1] Single Pole Rocker Switches: Single pole

specified product category\n[S_3] Four Way Multi-Location Control Switches: Four-way switches that work with three-way switches to control lighting from three or more locations in both rocker and toggle styles, e.g. four-way rocker switches, four-way decorator switches, paddle four way switches, 4-way decorator switches, 4-way paddle switches\n[S_4] Multi-Function Combination Switches: Switches that combine multiple individual switching functions in a single device for controlling multiple circuits, e.g. duplex rocker switches, combination decorator switches, dual rocker switches, triple rocker switches, dual paddle switches, double decorator switches, twin rocker switches, duplex switches, combination double switches\n[S_5] High Amperage Rocker Switches: Rocker switches rated for 20 amp or higher current loads, e.g. 20 amp rocker switches, commercial grade high current switches\n[S_6] Motion Sensor Switches: Switches with built-in motion detection for automatic operation, e.g. motion sensor switches, occupancy sensor switches, motion activated switches, auto-on switches\n[S_7] LED Illuminated Indicator Switches: Switches with built-in LED indicators, pilot lights, or locator lights for visibility in dark conditions, e.g. LED illuminated switches, pilot light switches, lighted rocker switches, night light switches, LED indicator switches, locator light switches, status indicator switches, combination switches with pilot lights\n[S_8] WiFi Connected Smart Switches: WiFi or Bluetooth enabled switches for remote control and automation via smartphone apps or voice assistants, e.g. smart light switches, connected switches, WiFi light switches, app-controlled switches, voice-activated switches, WiFi switches, Z-Wave switches, Zigbee switches\n[S_9] RF Wireless Remote Control Switches: RF remote controlled switches without hardwired connections for wireless operation, e.g. wireless remote switches, RF controlled switches, wireless switch kits, battery-operated remote switches, RF remote switches\n\n**PRODUCTS WITH CURRENT ASSIGNMENTS:**\n[P_38] 4 Way Decorative Light Switch, 15Amp, 120-277 Volt, AC Decorator Rocker Paddle Wall Switch
